5,500,000 square kilometres ( 2,100,000 sq mi ) are covered by the rainforest .
this region includes territory belonging to nine nations .

the wetter climate may have allowed the tropical rainforest to spread out across the continent .
climate fluctuations during the last 34 million years have allowed savanna regions to expand into the tropics .
during the oligocene , for example , the rainforest spanned a relatively narrow band .
it expanded again during the middle miocene , then retracted to a mostly inland formation at the last glacial maximum .
however , the rainforest still managed to thrive during these glacial periods , allowing for the survival and evolution of a broad diversity of species .

paul baran developed the concept distributed adaptive message block switching
provide a fault-tolerant , efficient routing method for telecommunication messages
this concept contrasted and contradicted the theretofore established principles of pre-allocation of network bandwidth
davies is credited with coining the modern name packet switching and inspiring numerous packet switching networks in europe

circuit switching
circuit switching is characterized by a fee per unit of connection time
by a fee per unit of information transmitted
circuit switching
a method which pre-allocates dedicated network bandwidth
by a fee per unit of connection time , even when no data is transferred
by a fee per unit of information transmitted , such as characters , packets , or messages
with or without intermediate forwarding nodes
asynchronously using first-in , first-out buffering , but may be forwarded according to some scheduling discipline for fair queuing

with or without intermediate forwarding nodes
by intermediate network nodes asynchronously using first-in , first-out buffering , but may be forwarded according to some scheduling discipline for fair queuing
the packets may be delivered according to a multiple access scheme
the concept of distributed adaptive message block switching
survivable communications networks
use of a decentralized network with multiple paths between any two points , dividing user messages into message blocks
delivery of these messages by store and forward switching
a general architecture for a large-scale , distributed , survivable communications network
by store and forward switching
distributed adaptive message block switching
use of a decentralized network with multiple paths between any two points , dividing user messages into message blocks , later called packets
independently developed the same message routing methodology as developed by baran
packet switching
proposed to build a nationwide network in the uk
use in the arpanet
donald davies
packet switching
suggested it for use in the arpanet
each packet includes complete addressing information
individually , sometimes resulting in different paths and out-of-order delivery
each packet is labeled with a destination address , source address , and port numbers . it may also be labeled with the sequence number of the packet
the original message / data is reassembled in the correct order , based on the packet sequence number
the packet header can be small , as it only needs to contain this code and any information , such as length , timestamp , or sequence number
routing a packet requires the node to look up the connection id in a table
a connection identifier rather than address information and are negotiated between endpoints so that they are delivered in order and with error checking
a setup phase in each involved node before any packet is transferred to establish the parameters of communication
connection-oriented operations . but x.25 does it at the network layer of the osi model . frame relay does it at level two , the data link layer
supplanted by the internet protocol ( ip ) at the network layer , and the asynchronous transfer mode ( atm ) and or versions of multi-protocol label switching
frame relay was used to interconnect lans across wide area networks . however , x.25 and well as frame relay have been supplanted
a typical configuration is to run ip over atm or a version of mpls
1969
two fundamental differences involved the division of functions and tasks between the hosts at the edge of the network and the network core
in the virtual call system , the network guarantees sequenced delivery of data to the host
user datagram protocol
a proprietary suite of networking protocols developed by apple inc. in 1985
that allowed local area networks to be established ad hoc without the requirement for a centralized router or server
automatically assigned addresses , updated the distributed namespace , and configured any required inter-network routing
a plug-n-play system
cyclades packet switching network
to make the hosts responsible for reliable delivery of data , rather than the network itself
using unreliable datagrams and associated end-to-end protocol mechanisms
later arpanet architecture
a suite of network protocols created by digital equipment corporation
connect two pdp-11 minicomputers
initially built with three layers , it later ( 1982 ) evolved into a seven-layer osi-compliant networking protocol
were open standards with published specifications , and several implementations were developed outside dec , including one for linux
a data network based on this voice-phone network was designed to connect ge 's four computer sales and service centers
the world 's first commercial online service
they lost money from the beginning , and sinback , a high-level marketing manager , was given the job of turning the business around
that a time-sharing system , based on kemney 's work at dartmouth - which used a computer on loan from ge - could be profitable
as a means to help the state 's educational and economic development
an interactive host to host connection was made between the ibm mainframe computer systems at the university of michigan in ann arbor and wayne state
ethernet attached hosts , and eventually tcp / ip and additional public universities in michigan join the network

telenet was incorporated in 1973 and started operations in 1975 . it went public in 1979 and was then sold to gte
an international data communications network headquartered in san jose , ca
connect host computers ( servers ) at thousands of large companies , educational institutions , and government agencies
connected via dial-up connections or dedicated async connections
government agencies and large companies ( mostly banks and airlines ) to build their own dedicated networks
private networks were often connected via gateways to the public network to reach locations not on the private network
there were two kinds of x.25 networks . some such as datapac and transpac
datapac was developed by bell northern research
a user or host could call a host on a foreign network by including the dnic of the remote network as part of the destination address
austpac was an australian public x.25 network operated by telstra
supporting applications such as on-line betting , financial applications
access can be via a dial-up terminal to a pad , or , by linking a permanent x.25 node to the network
was the public switched data network operated by the dutch ptt telecom
datanet 1 only referred to the network and the connected users via leased lines
public pad service telepad ( using the dnic 2049
use of the name was incorrect all these services were managed by the same people within one department of kpn contributed to the confusion
the computer science network
to extend networking benefits , for computer science departments at academic and research institutions that could not be directly connected to arpanet
role in spreading awareness of , and access to , national networking and was a major milestone on the path to development of the global internet
a not-for-profit united states computer networking consortium led by members from the research and education communities , industry , and government
the internet2 community , in partnership with qwest
abilene
a partnership with level 3 communications to launch a brand new nationwide network
internet2 officially retired abilene and now refers to its new , higher capacity network as the internet2 network
the national science foundation network
advanced research and education networking in the united states
it developed into a major part of the internet backbone
the very high-speed backbone network service
provide high-speed interconnection between nsf-sponsored supercomputing centers and select access points in the united states
the network was engineered and operated by mci telecommunications under a cooperative agreement with the nsf
by 1998 , the vbns had grown to connect more than 100 universities and research and engineering institutions via 12 national points of presence with ds-3
vbns installed one of the first ever production oc-48c ( 2.5 gbit / s ) ip links in february 1999 and went on to upgrade the entire backbone to oc-48c
