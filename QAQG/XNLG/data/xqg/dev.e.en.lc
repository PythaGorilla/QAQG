feynman diagrams are now fundamental for string theory and m-theory , and have even been extended topologically . the world-lines of the diagrams have developed to become tubes to allow better modeling of more complicated objects such as strings and membranes . shortly before his death , feynman criticized string theory in an interview : " i don 't like that they 're not calculating anything , " he said . " i don 't like that they don 't check their ideas . i don 't like that for anything that disagrees with an experiment , they cook up an explanation - a fix-up to say , ' well , it still might be true . ' " these words have since been much-quoted by opponents of the string-theoretic direction for particle physics .
in 1989 , troiden proposed a four-stage model for the development of homosexual sexual identity . the first stage , known as sensitization , usually starts in childhood , and is marked by the child 's becoming aware of same-sex attractions . the second stage , identity confusion , tends to occur a few years later . in this stage , the youth is overwhelmed by feelings of inner turmoil regarding their sexual orientation , and begins to engage sexual experiences with same-sex partners . in the third stage of identity assumption , which usually takes place a few years after the adolescent has left home , adolescents begin to come out to their family and close friends , and assumes a self-definition as gay , lesbian , or bisexual . in the final stage , known as commitment , the young adult adopts their sexual identity as a lifestyle . therefore , this model estimates that the process of coming out begins in childhood , and continues through the early to mid 20s . this model has been contested , and alternate ideas have been explored in recent years .
after napoleon imposed the convention of artlenburg ( convention of the elbe ) on july 5 , 1803 , about 30,000 french soldiers occupied hanover . the convention also required disbanding the army of hanover . however , george iii did not recognize the convention of the elbe . this resulted in a great number of soldiers from hanover eventually emigrating to great britain , where the king 's german legion was formed . it was the only german army to fight against france throughout the entire napoleonic wars . the legion later played an important role in the battle of waterloo in 1815 . the congress of vienna in 1815 elevated the electorate to the kingdom of hanover . the capital town hanover expanded to the western bank of the leine and since then has grown considerably .
in a ' letter to american people ' written by osama bin laden in 2002 , he stated that one of the reasons he was fighting america is because of its support of india on the kashmir issue . while on a trip to delhi in 2002 , u.s. secretary of defense donald rumsfeld suggested that al-qaeda was active in kashmir , though he did not have any hard evidence . an investigation in 2002 unearthed evidence that al-qaeda and its affiliates were prospering in pakistan-administered kashmir with tacit approval of pakistan 's national intelligence agency inter-services intelligence . a team of special air service and delta force was sent into indian-administered kashmir in 2002 to hunt for osama bin laden after reports that he was being sheltered by the kashmiri militant group harkat-ul-mujahideen . u.s. officials believed that al-qaeda was helping organize a campaign of terror in kashmir in order to provoke conflict between india and pakistan . fazlur rehman khalil , the leader of the harkat-ul-mujahideen , signed al-qaeda 's 1998 declaration of holy war , which called on muslims to attack all americans and their allies . indian sources claimed that in 2006 , al-qaeda claimed they had established a wing in kashmir ; this worried the indian government . india also claimed that al-qaeda has strong ties with the kashmir militant groups lashkar-e-taiba and jaish-e-mohammed in pakistan . while on a visit to pakistan in january 2010 , u.s. defense secretary robert gates stated that al-qaeda was seeking to destabilize the region and planning to provoke a nuclear war between india and pakistan .
the developments during world war ii continued for a short time into the post-war period as well . in particular the u.s. army set up a huge air defence network around its larger cities based on radar-guided 90 mm and 120 mm guns . us efforts continued into the 1950s with the 75 mm skysweeper system , an almost fully automated system including the radar , computers , power , and auto-loading gun on a single powered platform . the skysweeper replaced all smaller guns then in use in the army , notably the 40 mm bofors . in europe nato 's allied command europe developed an integrated air defence system , nato air defence ground environment ( nadge ) , that later became the nato integrated air defence system .
arsenal fans often refer to themselves as " gooners , " the name derived from the team 's nickname , " the gunners . " the fanbase is large and generally loyal , and virtually all home matches sell out ; in 2007-08 arsenal had the second-highest average league attendance for an english club ( 60,070 , which was 99.5 % of available capacity ) , and , as of 2015 , the third-highest all-time average attendance . arsenal have the seventh highest average attendance of european football clubs only behind borussia dortmund , fc barcelona , manchester united , real madrid , bayern munich , and schalke . the club 's location , adjoining wealthy areas such as canonbury and barnsbury , mixed areas such as islington , holloway , highbury , and the adjacent london borough of camden , and largely working-class areas such as finsbury park and stoke newington , has meant that arsenal 's supporters have come from a variety of social classes .
von braun and his team were sent to the united states army 's white sands proving ground , located in new mexico , in 1945 . they set about assembling the captured v2s and began a program of launching them and instructing american engineers in their operation . these tests led to the first rocket to take photos from outer space , and the first two-stage rocket , the wac corporal-v2 combination , in 1949 . the german rocket team was moved from fort bliss to the army 's new redstone arsenal , located in huntsville , alabama , in 1950 . from here , von braun and his team would develop the army 's first operational medium-range ballistic missile , the redstone rocket , that would , in slightly modified versions , launch both america 's first satellite , and the first piloted mercury space missions . it became the basis for both the jupiter and saturn family of rockets .
despite early victories , pyrrhus found his position in italy untenable . rome steadfastly refused to negotiate with pyrrhus as long as his army remained in italy . facing unacceptably heavy losses from each encounter with the roman army , pyrrhus withdrew from the peninsula ( hence the term " pyrrhic victory " ) . in 275 bc , pyrrhus again met the roman army at the battle of beneventum . while beneventum was indecisive , pyrrhus realised his army had been exhausted and reduced by years of foreign campaigns . seeing little hope for further gains , he withdrew completely from italy .
the british high-definition tv service started trials in august 1936 and a regular service on 2 november 1936 using both the ( mechanical ) baird 240 line sequential scan ( later to be inaccurately rechristened ' progressive ' ) and the ( electronic ) marconi-emi 405 line interlaced systems . the baird system was discontinued in february 1937 . in 1938 france followed with their own 441-line system , variants of which were also used by a number of other countries . the us ntsc 525-line system joined in 1941 . in 1949 france introduced an even higher-resolution standard at 819 lines , a system that should have been high definition even by today 's standards , but was monochrome only and the technical limitations of the time prevented it from achieving the definition of which it should have been capable . all of these systems used interlacing and a 4 : 3 aspect ratio except the 240-line system which was progressive ( actually described at the time by the technically correct term " sequential " ) and the 405-line system which started as 5 : 4 and later changed to 4 : 3 . the 405-line system adopted the ( at that time ) revolutionary idea of interlaced scanning to overcome the flicker problem of the 240-line with its 25 hz frame rate . the 240-line system could have doubled its frame rate but this would have meant that the transmitted signal would have doubled in bandwidth , an unacceptable option as the video baseband bandwidth was required to be not more than 3 mhz .
ptolemy 's geography divided asia on a similar basis . in the north is " scythia this side of the himalayas " and " scythia beyond the himalayas . " to the south is " india on this side of the ganges " and " india beyond the ganges . " asia began on the coast of anatolia ( " land of the rising sun " ) . beyond the ganges and himalayas ( including the tien shan ) were serica and serae ( sections of china ) and some other identifiable far eastern locations known to the voyagers and geographers but not to the general european public .
it includes the entire old town , which is also a unesco world heritage site , and many sites within and around it . some of the most notable in the old town include the cathedral which was started in 1421 and is the tallest cathedral in switzerland , the zytglogge and kafigturm towers , which mark two successive expansions of the old town , and the holy ghost church , which is one of the largest swiss reformed churches in switzerland . within the old town , there are eleven 16th century fountains , most attributed to hans gieng , that are on the list .
paris is a city of books and bookstores . in the 1970s , 80 percent of french-language publishing houses were found in paris , almost all on the left bank in the 5th , 6th and 7th arrondissements . since that time , because of high prices , some publishers have moved out to the less expensive areas . it is also a city of small bookstores ; there are about 150 bookstores in the 5th arrondissement alone , plus another 250 book stalls along the seine . small paris bookstores are protected against competition from discount booksellers by french law ; books , even e-books , cannot be discounted more than five percent below their publisher 's cover price .
on 20 may 2011 , royal dutch shell 's final investment decision for the world 's first floating liquefied natural gas ( flng ) facility was finalized following the discovery of the remote offshore prelude field - located off australia 's northwestern coast and estimated to contain about 3 trillion cubic feet of natural gas equivalent reserves - in 2007 . flng technology is based on liquefied natural gas ( lng ) developments that were pioneered in the mid-20th century and facilitates the exploitation of untapped natural gas reserves located in remote areas , often too small to extract any other way .
the domestic tv bbc television channels are broadcast without any commercial advertising and collectively they account for more than 30 % of all uk viewing . the services are funded by a television licence .
rothko also began using the new synthetic pigments , but not always with happy results . in 1962 he donated to harvard university a series of large murals of the passion of christ whose predominant colors were dark pink and deep crimson . he mixed mostly traditional colors to make the pink and crimson ; synthetic ultramarine , cerulean blue , and titanium white , but he also used two new organic reds , naphtol and lithol . the naphtol did well , but the lithol slowly changed color when exposed to light . within five years the deep pinks and reds had begun to turn light blue , and by 1979 the paintings were ruined and had to be taken down .
by the 1950s the success of digital electronic computers had spelled the end for most analog computing machines , but analog computers remain in use in some specialized applications such as education ( control systems ) and aircraft ( slide rule ) .
houston ( i / ˈhjuːstən / hyoo-stən ) is the most populous city in texas and the fourth most populous city in the united states , located in southeast texas near the gulf of mexico . with a census-estimated 2014 population of 2.239 million people , within a land area of 599.6 square miles ( 1,553 km2 ) , it also is the largest city in the southern united states , as well as the seat of harris county . it is the principal city of houston-the woodlands-sugar land , which is the fifth most populated metropolitan area in the united states .
in the 10th century the establishment of churches and monasteries led to the development of stone architecture that elaborated vernacular roman forms , from which the term " romanesque " is derived . where available , roman brick and stone buildings were recycled for their materials . from the tentative beginnings known as the first romanesque , the style flourished and spread across europe in a remarkably homogeneous form . just before 1000 there was a great wave of building stone churches all over europe . romanesque buildings have massive stone walls , openings topped by semi-circular arches , small windows , and , particularly in france , arched stone vaults . the large portal with coloured sculpture in high relief became a central feature of facades , especially in france , and the capitals of columns were often carved with narrative scenes of imaginative monsters and animals . according to art historian c. r. dodwell , " virtually all the churches in the west were decorated with wall-paintings , " of which few survive . simultaneous with the development in church architecture , the distinctive european form of the castle was developed , and became crucial to politics and warfare .
sanskrit has also influenced sino-tibetan languages through the spread of buddhist texts in translation . buddhism was spread to china by mahayana missionaries sent by ashoka , mostly through translations of buddhist hybrid sanskrit . many terms were transliterated directly and added to the chinese vocabulary . chinese words like 剎那 chana ( devanagari : क  षण ksana ' instantaneous period ' ) were borrowed from sanskrit . many sanskrit texts survive only in tibetan collections of commentaries to the buddhist teachings , the tengyur .
humans regard certain insects as pests , and attempt to control them using insecticides and a host of other techniques . some insects damage crops by feeding on sap , leaves or fruits . a few parasitic species are pathogenic . some insects perform complex ecological roles ; blow-flies , for example , help consume carrion but also spread diseases . insect pollinators are essential to the life-cycle of many flowering plant species on which most organisms , including humans , are at least partly dependent ; without them , the terrestrial portion of the biosphere ( including humans ) would be devastated . many other insects are considered ecologically beneficial as predators and a few provide direct economic benefit . silkworms and bees have been used extensively by humans for the production of silk and honey , respectively . in some cultures , people eat the larvae or adults of certain insects .
in the martial arts , faisal jeylani aweys and mohamed deq abdulle also took home a silver medal and fourth place , respectively , at the 2013 open world taekwondo challenge cup in tongeren . the somali national olympic committee has devised a special support program to ensure continued success in future tournaments . additionally , mohamed jama has won both world and european titles in k1 and thai boxing .
the list below displays the top-ranked country from each year of the human development index . norway has been ranked the highest twelve times , canada eight times , followed by japan which has been ranked highest three times . iceland has been ranked highest twice .
there is usually an indication for a specific identification of an infectious agent only when such identification can aid in the treatment or prevention of the disease , or to advance knowledge of the course of an illness prior to the development of effective therapeutic or preventative measures . for example , in the early 1980s , prior to the appearance of azt for the treatment of aids , the course of the disease was closely followed by monitoring the composition of patient blood samples , even though the outcome would not offer the patient any further treatment options . in part , these studies on the appearance of hiv in specific communities permitted the advancement of hypotheses as to the route of transmission of the virus . by understanding how the disease was transmitted , resources could be targeted to the communities at greatest risk in campaigns aimed at reducing the number of new infections . the specific serological diagnostic identification , and later genotypic or molecular identification , of hiv also enabled the development of hypotheses as to the temporal and geographical origins of the virus , as well as a myriad of other hypothesis . the development of molecular diagnostic tools have enabled physicians and researchers to monitor the efficacy of treatment with anti-retroviral drugs . molecular diagnostics are now commonly used to identify hiv in healthy people long before the onset of illness and have been used to demonstrate the existence of people who are genetically resistant to hiv infection . thus , while there still is no cure for aids , there is great therapeutic and predictive benefit to identifying the virus and monitoring the virus levels within the blood of infected individuals , both for the patient and for the community at large .
paul vi was the first pope to receive an anglican archbishop of canterbury , michael ramsey in official audience as head of church , after the private audience visit of archbishop geoffrey fisher to pope john xxiii on 2 december 1960 . ramsey met paul three times during his visit and opened the anglican centre in rome to increase their mutual knowledge . he praised paul vi [ e ] and his contributions in the service of unity . paul replied that " by entering into our house , you are entering your own house , we are happy to open our door and heart to you . " the two church leaders signed a common declaration , which put an end to the disputes of the past and outlined a common agenda for the future .
in january 2010 , youtube launched an experimental version of the site that used the built-in multimedia capabilities of web browsers supporting the html5 standard . this allowed videos to be viewed without requiring adobe flash player or any other plug-in to be installed . the youtube site had a page that allowed supported browsers to opt into the html5 trial . only browsers that supported html5 video using the h.264 or webm formats could play the videos , and not all videos on the site were available .
in 2013 , washington university received a record 30,117 applications for a freshman class of 1,500 with an acceptance rate of 13.7 % . more than 90 % of incoming freshmen whose high schools ranked were ranked in the top 10 % of their high school classes . in 2006 , the university ranked fourth overall and second among private universities in the number of enrolled national merit scholar freshmen , according to the national merit scholar corporation 's annual report . in 2008 , washington university was ranked # 1 for quality of life according to the princeton review , among other top rankings . in addition , the olin business school 's undergraduate program is among the top 4 in the country . the olin business school 's undergraduate program is also among the country 's most competitive , admitting only 14 % of applicants in 2007 and ranking # 1 in sat scores with an average composite of 1492 m + cr according to businessweek .
in 1975 , the band left for a world tour with each member in zandra rhodes-created costumes and accompanied with banks of lights and effects . they toured the us as headliners , and played in canada for the first time . in september , after an acromonious split with trident , the band negotiated themselves out of their trident studios contract and searched for new management . one of the options they considered was an offer from led zeppelin 's manager , peter grant . grant wanted them to sign with led zeppelin 's own production company , swan song records . the band found the contract unacceptable and instead contacted elton john 's manager , john reid , who accepted the position .
the members of the beatles were made mbes in 1965 . john lennon justified the comparative merits of his investiture by comparing military membership in the order : " lots of people who complained about us receiving the mbe [ status ] received theirs for heroism in the war - for killing people ... we received ours for entertaining other people . i 'd say we deserve ours more . " lennon later returned his mbe insignia on 25 november 1969 as part of his ongoing peace protests . other criticism centres on the claim that many recipients of the order are being rewarded with honours for simply doing their jobs ; critics claim that the civil service and judiciary receive far more orders and honours than leaders of other professions .
most birds scoop water in their beaks and raise their head to let water run down the throat . some species , especially of arid zones , belonging to the pigeon , finch , mousebird , button-quail and bustard families are capable of sucking up water without the need to tilt back their heads . some desert birds depend on water sources and sandgrouse are particularly well known for their daily congregations at waterholes . nesting sandgrouse and many plovers carry water to their young by wetting their belly feathers . some birds carry water for chicks at the nest in their crop or regurgitate it along with food . the pigeon family , flamingos and penguins have adaptations to produce a nutritive fluid called crop milk that they provide to their chicks .
many other databases have application software that accesses the database on behalf of end-users , without exposing the dbms interface directly . application programmers may use a wire protocol directly , or more likely through an application programming interface . database designers and database administrators interact with the dbms through dedicated interfaces to build and maintain the applications ' databases , and thus need some more knowledge and understanding about how dbmss operate and the dbmss ' external interfaces and tuning parameters .
many of nara 's most requested records are frequently used for genealogy research . this includes census records from 1790 to 1930 , ships ' passenger lists , and naturalization records .
in may 2005 , ge announced the launch of a program called " ecomagination , " intended , in the words of ceo jeff immelt " to develop tomorrow 's solutions such as solar energy , hybrid locomotives , fuel cells , lower-emission aircraft engines , lighter and stronger durable materials , efficient lighting , and water purification technology . " the announcement prompted an op-ed piece in the new york times to observe that , " while general electric 's increased emphasis on clean technology will probably result in improved products and benefit its bottom line , mr. immelt 's credibility as a spokesman on national environmental policy is fatally flawed because of his company 's intransigence in cleaning up its own toxic legacy . "
reflections generally affect polarization . for radio waves , one important reflector is the ionosphere which can change the wave 's polarization . thus for signals received following reflection by the ionosphere ( a skywave ) , a consistent polarization cannot be expected . for line-of-sight communications or ground wave propagation , horizontally or vertically polarized transmissions generally remain in about the same polarization state at the receiving location . matching the receiving antenna 's polarization to that of the transmitter can make a very substantial difference in received signal strength .
although bell was , and still is , accused of stealing the telephone from gray , bell used gray 's water transmitter design only after bell 's patent had been granted , and only as a proof of concept scientific experiment , to prove to his own satisfaction that intelligible " articulate speech " ( bell 's words ) could be electrically transmitted . after march 1876 , bell focused on improving the electromagnetic telephone and never used gray 's liquid transmitter in public demonstrations or commercial use .
during a period of tough competition between mortgage lenders for revenue and market share , and when the supply of creditworthy borrowers was limited , mortgage lenders relaxed underwriting standards and originated riskier mortgages to less creditworthy borrowers . in the view of some analysts , the relatively conservative government-sponsored enterprises ( gses ) policed mortgage originators and maintained relatively high underwriting standards prior to 2003 . however , as market power shifted from securitizers to originators and as intense competition from private securitizers undermined gse power , mortgage standards declined and risky loans proliferated . the worst loans were originated in 2004-2007 , the years of the most intense competition between securitizers and the lowest market share for the gses .
the new york public library , which has the largest collection of any public library system in the united states , serves manhattan , the bronx , and staten island . queens is served by the queens borough public library , the nation 's second largest public library system , while the brooklyn public library serves brooklyn .
at the dawn of the grand lodge era , during the 1720s , james anderson composed the first printed constitutions for freemasons , the basis for most subsequent constitutions , which specifically excluded women from freemasonry . as freemasonry spread , continental masons began to include their ladies in lodges of adoption , which worked three degrees with the same names as the men 's but different content . the french officially abandoned the experiment in the early 19th century . later organisations with a similar aim emerged in the united states , but distinguished the names of the degrees from those of male masonry .
birds need to alter their metabolism in order to meet the demands of migration . the storage of energy through the accumulation of fat and the control of sleep in nocturnal migrants require special physiological adaptations . in addition , the feathers of a bird suffer from wear-and-tear and require to be molted . the timing of this molt - usually once a year but sometimes twice - varies with some species molting prior to moving to their winter grounds and others molting prior to returning to their breeding grounds . apart from physiological adaptations , migration sometimes requires behavioural changes such as flying in flocks to reduce the energy used in migration or the risk of predation .
true exhibition games between opposing colleges at the highest level do not exist in college football ; due to the importance of opinion polling in the top level of college football , even exhibition games would not truly be exhibitions because they could influence the opinions of those polled . intramural games are possible because a team playing against itself leaves little ability for poll participants to make judgments , and at levels below the football bowl subdivision ( fbs ) , championships are decided by objective formulas and thus those teams can play non-league games without affecting their playoff hopes .
british somaliland became independent on 26 june 1960 as the state of somaliland , and the trust territory of somalia ( the former italian somaliland ) followed suit five days later . on 1 july 1960 , the two territories united to form the somali republic , albeit within boundaries drawn up by italy and britain . a government was formed by abdullahi issa mohamud and muhammad haji ibrahim egal other members of the trusteeship and protectorate governments , with haji bashir ismail yusuf as president of the somali national assembly , aden abdullah osman daar as the president of the somali republic and abdirashid ali shermarke as prime minister ( later to become president from 1967 to 1969 ) . on 20 july 1961 and through a popular referendum , the people of somalia ratified a new constitution , which was first drafted in 1960 . in 1967 , muhammad haji ibrahim egal became prime minister , a position to which he was appointed by shermarke . egal would later become the president of the autonomous somaliland region in northwestern somalia .
key personnel involved in the flight deck include the shooters , the handler , and the air boss . shooters are naval aviators or naval flight officers and are responsible for launching aircraft . the handler works just inside the island from the flight deck and is responsible for the movement of aircraft before launching and after recovery . the " air boss " ( usually a commander ) occupies the top bridge ( primary flight control , also called primary or the tower ) and has the overall responsibility for controlling launch , recovery and " those aircraft in the air near the ship , and the movement of planes on the flight deck , which itself resembles a well-choreographed ballet . " the captain of the ship spends most of his time one level below primary on the navigation bridge . below this is the flag bridge , designated for the embarked admiral and his staff .
the most notable cricket club in cork is cork county cricket club , which was formed in 1874 . although located within the munster jurisdiction , the club plays in the leinster senior league . the club plays at the mardyke , a ground which has hosted three first-class matches in 1947 , 1961 and 1973 . all three involved ireland playing scotland . the cork cricket academy operates within the city , with the stated aim of introducing the sport to schools in the city and county . cork 's other main cricket club , harlequins cricket club , play close to cork airport .
the set of graphic and format characters defined by unicode does not correspond directly to the repertoire of abstract characters that is representable under unicode . unicode encodes characters by associating an abstract character with a particular code point . however , not all abstract characters are encoded as a single unicode character , and some abstract characters may be represented in unicode by a sequence of two or more characters . for example , a latin small letter " i " with an ogonek , a dot above , and an acute accent , which is required in lithuanian , is represented by the character sequence u + 012f , u + 0307 , u + 0301 . unicode maintains a list of uniquely named character sequences for abstract characters that are not directly encoded in unicode .
in 2010 , 24.9 percent of households reported having children under the age of 18 living with them , 28.3 percent were married couples living together and 22.5 percent had a female householder with no husband present , 6.0 percent had a male householder with no wife present , and 43.2 percent were non-families . the city reported 34.1 percent of all households were made up of individuals while 10.5 percent had someone living alone who was 65 years of age or older . the average household size was 2.45 and the average family size was 3.20 . in 2013 , the percentage of women who gave birth in the previous 12 months who were unmarried was 56 percent . of philadelphia 's adults , 31 percent were married or lived as a couple , 55 percent were not married , 11 percent were divorced or separated , and 3 percent were widowed .
urban anthropology is concerned with issues of urbanization , poverty , and neoliberalism . ulf hannerz quotes a 1960s remark that traditional anthropologists were " a notoriously agoraphobic lot , anti-urban by definition . " various social processes in the western world as well as in the " third world " ( the latter being the habitual focus of attention of anthropologists ) brought the attention of " specialists in ' other cultures ' " closer to their homes . there are two principle approaches in urban anthropology : by examining the types of cities or examining the social issues within the cities . these two methods are overlapping and dependent of each other . by defining different types of cities , one would use social factors as well as economic and political factors to categorize the cities . by directly looking at the different social issues , one would also be studying how they affect the dynamic of the city .
the tuvalu media department of the government of tuvalu operates radio tuvalu which broadcasts from funafuti . in 2011 the japanese government provided financial support to construct a new am broadcast studio . the installation of upgraded transmission equipment allows radio tuvalu to be heard on all nine islands of tuvalu . the new am radio transmitter on funafuti replaced the fm radio service to the outer islands and freed up satellite bandwidth for mobile services . fenui - news from tuvalu is a free digital publication of the tuvalu media department that is emailed to subscribers and operates a facebook page , which publishes news about government activities and news about tuvaluan events , such as a special edition covering the results of the 2015 general election .
a substantial number of artists and other figures have been influenced by , or complimented , west 's work , including hip hop artists rza of wu-tang clan , chuck d of public enemy , and dj premier of gang starr . both drake and casey veggies have acknowledged being influenced directly by west . non-rap artists such as english singer-songwriters adele and lily allen , new zealand artist lorde , rock band arctic monkeys , pop singer halsey , sergio pizzorno of english rock band kasabian and american indie rock group mgmt have cited west as an influence . experimental and electronic artists such as james blake daniel lopatin , and tim hecker have also cited west 's work as an inspiration . experimental rock pioneer and velvet underground founder lou reed , in a review of west 's album yeezus , wrote that " the guy really , really , really is talented . he 's really trying to raise the bar . no one 's near doing what he 's doing , it 's not even on the same planet . " musicians such as paul mccartney and prince have also commended west 's work . famed tesla motors ceo and inventor elon musk complimented west in a piece for time magazine 's 100 most influential people list , writing that :
physical exercise , particularly continuous aerobic exercises such as running , cycling and swimming , has many cognitive benefits and effects on the brain . influences on the brain include increases in neurotransmitter levels , improved oxygen and nutrient delivery , and increased neurogenesis in the hippocampus . the effects of exercise on memory have important implications for improving children 's academic performance , maintaining mental abilities in old age , and the prevention and potential cure of neurological diseases .
after over a dozen more subpar seasons , in 1981 the cubs hired gm dallas green from philadelphia to turn around the franchise . green had managed the 1980 phillies to the world series title . one of his early gm moves brought in a young phillies minor-league 3rd baseman named ryne sandberg , along with larry bowa for ivan dejesus . the 1983 cubs had finished 71-91 under lee elia , who was fired before the season ended by green . green continued the culture of change and overhauled the cubs roster , front-office and coaching staff prior to 1984 . jim frey was hired to manage the 1984 cubs , with don zimmer coaching 3rd base and billy connors serving as pitching coach .
the bbc 's highlights package on saturday and sunday nights , as well as other evenings when fixtures justify , will run until 2016 . television rights alone for the period 2010 to 2013 have been purchased for £ 1.782 billion . on 22 june 2009 , due to troubles encountered by setanta sports after it failed to meet a final deadline over a £ 30 million payment to the premier league , espn was awarded two packages of uk rights containing a total of 46 matches that were available for the 2009-10 season as well as a package of 23 matches per season from 2010-11 to 2012-13 . on 13 june 2012 , the premier league announced that bt had been awarded 38 games a season for the 2013-14 through 2015-16 seasons at £ 246 million-a-year . the remaining 116 games were retained by sky who paid £ 760 million-a-year . the total domestic rights have raised £ 3.018 billion , an increase of 70.2 % over the 2010-11 to 2012-13 rights . the value of the licensing deal rose by another 70.2 % in 2015 , when sky and bt paid a total of £ 5.136 billion to renew their contracts with the premier league for another three years up to the 2018-19 season .
" near east " remained popular in diplomatic , trade and journalistic circles , but a variation soon developed among the scholars and the men of the cloth and their associates : " the nearer east , " reverting to the classical and then more scholarly distinction of " nearer " and " farther . " they undoubtedly saw a need to separate the biblical lands from the terrain of the ottoman empire . the christians saw the country as the land of the old and new testaments , where christianity had developed . the scholars in the field of studies that eventually became biblical archaeology attempted to define it on the basis of archaeology .
the u.s. financial crisis inquiry commission reported its findings in january 2011 . it concluded that " the crisis was avoidable and was caused by : widespread failures in financial regulation , including the federal reserve 's failure to stem the tide of toxic mortgages ; dramatic breakdowns in corporate governance including too many financial firms acting recklessly and taking on too much risk ; an explosive mix of excessive borrowing and risk by households and wall street that put the financial system on a collision course with crisis ; key policy makers ill prepared for the crisis , lacking a full understanding of the financial system they oversaw ; and systemic breaches in accountability and ethics at all levels . "
alfred north whitehead was born in ramsgate , kent , england , in 1861 . his father , alfred whitehead , was a minister and schoolmaster of chatham house academy , a successful school for boys established by thomas whitehead , alfred north 's grandfather . whitehead himself recalled both of them as being very successful schoolmasters , but that his grandfather was the more extraordinary man . whitehead 's mother was maria sarah whitehead , formerly maria sarah buckmaster . whitehead was apparently not particularly close with his mother , as he never mentioned her in any of his writings , and there is evidence that whitehead 's wife , evelyn , had a low opinion of her .
during the years 1940-1955 , the rate of decline in the u.s. death rate accelerated from 2 % per year to 8 % per year , then returned to the historical rate of 2 % per year . the dramatic decline in the immediate post-war years has been attributed to the rapid development of new treatments and vaccines for infectious disease that occurred during these years . vaccine development continued to accelerate , with the most notable achievement of the period being jonas salk 's 1954 development of the polio vaccine under the funding of the non-profit national foundation for infantile paralysis . the vaccine process was never patented , but was instead given to pharmaceutical companies to manufacture as a low-cost generic . in 1960 maurice hilleman of merck sharp & dohme identified the sv40 virus , which was later shown to cause tumors in many mammalian species . it was later determined that sv40 was present as a contaminant in polio vaccine lots that had been administered to 90 % of the children in the united states . the contamination appears to have originated both in the original cell stock and in monkey tissue used for production . in 2004 the united states cancer institute announced that it had concluded that sv40 is not associated with cancer in people .

as of the first decade of the 21st century , contemporary neoclassical architecture is usually classed under the umbrella term of new classical architecture . sometimes it is also referred to as neo-historicism / revivalism , traditionalism or simply neoclassical architecture like the historical style . for sincere traditional-style architecture that sticks to regional architecture , materials and craftsmanship , the term traditional architecture ( or vernacular ) is mostly used . the driehaus architecture prize is awarded to major contributors in the field of 21st century traditional or classical architecture , and comes with a prize money twice as high as that of the modernist pritzker prize .
the committee debated the possibility of a shift function ( like in ita2 ) , which would allow more than 64 codes to be represented by a six-bit code . in a shifted code , some character codes determine choices between options for the following character codes . it allows compact encoding , but is less reliable for data transmission as an error in transmitting the shift code typically makes a long part of the transmission unreadable . the standards committee decided against shifting , and so ascii required at least a seven-bit code . : 215 , 236 § 4
criticism of the war on terror addresses the issues , morality , efficiency , economics , and other questions surrounding the war on terror and made against the phrase itself , calling it a misnomer . the notion of a " war " against " terrorism " has proven highly contentious , with critics charging that it has been exploited by participating governments to pursue long-standing policy / military objectives , reduce civil liberties , and infringe upon human rights . it is argued that the term war is not appropriate in this context ( as in war on drugs ) , since there is no identifiable enemy , and that it is unlikely international terrorism can be brought to an end by military means .
madonna was criticized for her performance of " like a virgin " at the first 1984 mtv video music awards ( vma ) . she appeared on stage atop a giant wedding cake , wearing a wedding dress and white gloves . the performance is noted by mtv as an iconic moment in vma history . in later years , madonna commented that she was terrified of the performance . the next hit was " material girl " promoted by her video , a mimicry of marilyn monroe 's performance of the song " diamonds are a girl 's best friend " from the 1953 film gentlemen prefer blondes . while filming this video , madonna started dating actor sean penn . they married on her birthday in 1985 . like a virgin was certified diamond by the recording industry association of america and sold more than 25 million copies worldwide . in february 1984 , according to the film director sir richard attenborough , madonna auditioned at the royale theatre on broadway for a dance role in his movie version of a chorus line using her birth-name of ciccone , but he rejected her .
at extremely large airports , a circuit is in place but not usually used . rather , aircraft ( usually only commercial with long routes ) request approach clearance while they are still hours away from the airport , often before they even take off from their departure point . large airports have a frequency called clearance delivery which is used by departing aircraft specifically for this purpose . this then allows aircraft to take the most direct approach path to the runway and land without worrying about interference from other aircraft . while this system keeps the airspace free and is simpler for pilots , it requires detailed knowledge of how aircraft are planning to use the airport ahead of time and is therefore only possible with large commercial airliners on pre-scheduled flights . the system has recently become so advanced that controllers can predict whether an aircraft will be delayed on landing before it even takes off ; that aircraft can then be delayed on the ground , rather than wasting expensive fuel waiting in the air .
a watt balance is an instrument for comparing two powers , one of which is measured in si watts and the other of which is measured in conventional electrical units . from the definition of the conventional watt w90 , this gives a measure of the product kj2rk in si units , where rk is the von klitzing constant which appears in the quantum hall effect . if the theoretical treatments of the josephson effect and the quantum hall effect are valid , and in particular assuming that rk = h / e2 , the measurement of kj2rk is a direct determination of the planck constant .
since the protestant reformation , the most prominent christian denomination in thuringia has been lutheranism . during the gdr period , church membership was discouraged and has continued shrinking since the reunification in 1990 . today over two thirds of the population is non-religious . the protestant evangelical church in germany has had the largest number of members in the state , adhered to by 24.0 % of the population in 2009 . members of the catholic church formed 7.8 % of the population , while 68.2 % of thuringians were non-religious or adhere to other faiths . the highest protestant concentrations are in the small villages of southern and western thuringia , whereas the bigger cities are even more non-religious ( up to 88 % in gera ) . catholic regions are the eichsfeld in the northwest and parts of the rhon mountains around geisa in the southwest . protestant church membership is shrinking rapidly , whereas the catholic church is somewhat more stable because of catholic migration from poland , southern europe and west germany . other religions play no significant role in thuringia . there are only a few thousand muslims ( largely migrants ) and about 750 jews ( mostly migrants from russia ) living in thuringia . furthermore , there are some orthodox communities of eastern european migrants and some traditional protestant free churches in thuringia without any societal influence .
the body 's capability to react to antigen depends on a person 's age , antigen type , maternal factors and the area where the antigen is presented . neonates are said to be in a state of physiological immunodeficiency , because both their innate and adaptive immunological responses are greatly suppressed . once born , a child 's immune system responds favorably to protein antigens while not as well to glycoproteins and polysaccharides . in fact , many of the infections acquired by neonates are caused by low virulence organisms like staphylococcus and pseudomonas . in neonates , opsonic activity and the ability to activate the complement cascade is very limited . for example , the mean level of c3 in a newborn is approximately 65 % of that found in the adult . phagocytic activity is also greatly impaired in newborns . this is due to lower opsonic activity , as well as diminished up-regulation of integrin and selectin receptors , which limit the ability of neutrophils to interact with adhesion molecules in the endothelium . their monocytes are slow and have a reduced atp production , which also limits the newborn 's phagocytic activity . although , the number of total lymphocytes is significantly higher than in adults , the cellular and humoral immunity is also impaired . antigen-presenting cells in newborns have a reduced capability to activate t cells . also , t cells of a newborn proliferate poorly and produce very small amounts of cytokines like il-2 , il-4 , il-5 , il-12 , and ifn-g which limits their capacity to activate the humoral response as well as the phagocitic activity of macrophage . b cells develop early during gestation but are not fully active .
in addition to films , turner classic movies also airs original content , mostly documentaries about classic movie personalities , the world of filmmaking and particularly notable films . an occasional month-long series , race and hollywood , showcases films by and about people of non-white races , featuring discussions of how these pictures influenced white people 's image of said races , as well as how people of those races viewed themselves . previous installments have included " asian images on film " in 2008 , " native american images on film " in 2010 , " black images on film " in 2006 " latino images on film " in 2009 and " arab images on film " in 2011 . the network aired the film series screened out ( which explored the history and depiction of homosexuality in film ) in 2007 and religion on film ( focusing on the role of religion in cinematic works ) in 2005 . in 2011 , tcm debuted a new series entitled afi 's master class : the art of collaboration .
in several countries , fire safety officials encourage citizens to use the two annual clock shifts as reminders to replace batteries in smoke and carbon monoxide detectors , particularly in autumn , just before the heating and candle season causes an increase in home fires . similar twice-yearly tasks include reviewing and practicing fire escape and family disaster plans , inspecting vehicle lights , checking storage areas for hazardous materials , reprogramming thermostats , and seasonal vaccinations . locations without dst can instead use the first days of spring and autumn as reminders .
the crimean war ( 1853-1856 ) was part of a long-running contest between the major european powers for influence over territories of the declining ottoman empire . the financial burden of the war led the ottoman state to issue foreign loans amounting to 5 million pounds sterling on 4 august 1854 . the war caused an exodus of the crimean tatars , about 200,000 of whom moved to the ottoman empire in continuing waves of emigration . toward the end of the caucasian wars , 90 % of the circassians were ethnically cleansed and exiled from their homelands in the caucasus and fled to the ottoman empire , resulting in the settlement of 500,000 to 700,000 circassians in turkey . [ page needed ] some circassian organisations give much higher numbers , totaling 1-1.5 million deported or killed .
about 75 % of the population is employed in subsistence agriculture upon swazi nation land ( snl ) . in contrast with the commercial farms , swazi nation land suffers from low productivity and investment . this dual nature of the swazi economy , with high productivity in textile manufacturing and in the industrialised agricultural tdls on the one hand , and declining productivity subsistence agriculture ( on snl ) on the other , may well explain the country 's overall low growth , high inequality and unemployment .
in the 2000 census oklahoma city 's age composition was 25.5 % under the age of 18 , 10.7 % from 18 to 24 , 30.8 % from 25 to 44 , 21.5 % from 45 to 64 , and 11.5 % who were 65 years of age or older . the median age was 34 years . for every 100 females there were 95.6 males . for every 100 females age 18 and over , there were 92.7 males .
west 's fifth album , my beautiful dark twisted fantasy , has been noted by writers for its maximalist aesthetic and its incorporation of elements from west 's previous four albums . entertainment weekly 's simon vozick-levinson perceives that such elements " all recur at various points , " namely " the luxurious soul of 2004 's the college dropout , the symphonic pomp of late registration , the gloss of 2007 's graduation , and the emotionally exhausted electro of 2008 's 808s & heartbreak . " sean fennessey of the village voice writes that west " absorb [ ed ] the gifts of his handpicked collaborators , and occasionally elevat [ ed ] them " on previous studio albums , noting collaborators and elements as jon brion for late registration , dj toomp for graduation , and kid cudi for 808s & heartbreak .

through victoria 's reign , the gradual establishment of a modern constitutional monarchy in britain continued . reforms of the voting system increased the power of the house of commons at the expense of the house of lords and the monarch . in 1867 , walter bagehot wrote that the monarch only retained " the right to be consulted , the right to encourage , and the right to warn . " as victoria 's monarchy became more symbolic than political , it placed a strong emphasis on morality and family values , in contrast to the sexual , financial and personal scandals that had been associated with previous members of the house of hanover and which had discredited the monarchy . the concept of the " family monarchy , " with which the burgeoning middle classes could identify , was solidified .

the wine and beerhouse act 1869 reintroduced the stricter controls of the previous century . the sale of beers , wines or spirits required a licence for the premises from the local magistrates . further provisions regulated gaming , drunkenness , prostitution and undesirable conduct on licensed premises , enforceable by prosecution or more effectively by the landlord under threat of forfeiting his licence . licences were only granted , transferred or renewed at special licensing sessions courts , and were limited to respectable individuals . often these were ex-servicemen or ex-policemen ; retiring to run a pub was popular amongst military officers at the end of their service . licence conditions varied widely , according to local practice . they would specify permitted hours , which might require sunday closing , or conversely permit all-night opening near a market . typically they might require opening throughout the permitted hours , and the provision of food or lavatories . once obtained , licences were jealously protected by the licensees ( who were expected to be generally present , not an absentee owner or company ) , and even " occasional licences " to serve drinks at temporary premises such as fetes would usually be granted only to existing licensees . objections might be made by the police , rival landlords or anyone else on the grounds of infractions such as serving drunks , disorderly or dirty premises , or ignoring permitted hours .
when the u.s. entered world war ii on december 8 , 1941 , many montanans already had enlisted in the military to escape the poor national economy of the previous decade . another 40,000-plus montanans entered the armed forces in the first year following the declaration of war , and over 57,000 joined up before the war ended . these numbers constituted about 10 percent of the state 's total population , and montana again contributed one of the highest numbers of soldiers per capita of any state . many native americans were among those who served , including soldiers from the crow nation who became code talkers . at least 1500 montanans died in the war . montana also was the training ground for the first special service force or " devil 's brigade , " a joint u.s-canadian commando-style force that trained at fort william henry harrison for experience in mountainous and winter conditions before deployment . air bases were built in great falls , lewistown , cut bank and glasgow , some of which were used as staging areas to prepare planes to be sent to allied forces in the soviet union . during the war , about 30 japanese balloon bombs were documented to have landed in montana , though no casualties nor major forest fires were attributed to them .

south slavic dialects historically formed a continuum . the turbulent history of the area , particularly due to expansion of the ottoman empire , resulted in a patchwork of dialectal and religious differences . due to population migrations , shtokavian became the most widespread in the western balkans , intruding westwards into the area previously occupied by chakavian and kajkavian ( which further blend into slovenian in the northwest ) . bosniaks , croats and serbs differ in religion and were historically often part of different cultural circles , although a large part of the nations have lived side by side under foreign overlords . during that period , the language was referred to under a variety of names , such as " slavic , " " illyrian , " or according to region , " bosnian , " " serbian " and " croatian , " the latter often in combination with " slavonian " or " dalmatian . "
the history of emotions has become an increasingly popular topic recently , with some scholars arguing that it is an essential category of analysis , not unlike class , race , or gender . historians , like other social scientists , assume that emotions , feelings and their expressions are regulated in different ways by both different cultures and different historical times , and constructivist school of history claims even that some sentiments and meta-emotions , for example schadenfreude , are learnt and not only regulated by culture . historians of emotion trace and analyse the changing norms and rules of feeling , while examining emotional regimes , codes , and lexicons from social , cultural or political history perspectives . others focus on the history of medicine , science or psychology . what somebody can and may feel ( and show ) in a given situation , towards certain people or things , depends on social norms and rules . it is thus historically variable and open to change . several research centers have opened in the past few years in germany , england , spain , sweden and australia .
in 1903 hermann emil fischer and joseph von mering disclosed their discovery that diethylbarbituric acid , formed from the reaction of diethylmalonic acid , phosphorus oxychloride and urea , induces sleep in dogs . the discovery was patented and licensed to bayer pharmaceuticals , which marketed the compound under the trade name veronal as a sleep aid beginning in 1904 . systematic investigations of the effect of structural changes on potency and duration of action led to the discovery of phenobarbital at bayer in 1911 and the discovery of its potent anti-epileptic activity in 1912 . phenobarbital was among the most widely used drugs for the treatment of epilepsy through the 1970s , and as of 2014 , remains on the world health organizations list of essential medications . the 1950s and 1960s saw increased awareness of the addictive properties and abuse potential of barbiturates and amphetamines and led to increasing restrictions on their use and growing government oversight of prescribers . today , amphetamine is largely restricted to use in the treatment of attention deficit disorder and phenobarbital in the treatment of epilepsy .
as of 2009 , internet via satellite had a steady growth rate of 10 % to 15 % per year . it was particularly in demand in remote areas that did not have either dialup or wireless online services . the local telecommunications company dalkom somalia provided internet over satellite , as well as premium routes for media operators and content providers , and international voice gateway services for global carriers . it also offered inexpensive bandwidth through its internet backbone , whereas bandwidth ordinarily cost customers from $ 2,500 to $ 3,000 per month through the major international bandwidth providers . the main clients of these local satellite services were internet cafes , money transfer firms and other companies , as well as international community representatives . in total , there were over 300 local satellite terminals available aross the nation , which were linked to teleports in europe and asia . demand for the satellite services gradually began to fall as broadband wireless access rose . however , it increased in rural areas , as the main client base for the satellite services extended their operations into more remote locales .

" during october , the rok police executed people who were suspected to be sympathetic to north korea , and similar massacres were carried out until early 1951 .
guinea-bissau 's gdp per capita is one of the lowest in the world , and its human development index is one of the lowest on earth . more than two-thirds of the population lives below the poverty line . the economy depends mainly on agriculture ; fish , cashew nuts and ground nuts are its major exports .
research commissioned by cecil king from mark abrams of sussex university , the newspaper reading public of tomorrow , identified demographic changes which suggested reasons why the herald might be in decline . the new paper was intended to add a readership of ' social radicals ' to the herald 's ' political radicals ' . launched with an advertising budget of £ 400,000 the brash new paper " burst forth with tremendous energy , " according to the times . its initial print run of 3.5 million was attributed to ' curiosity ' and the ' advantage of novelty ' , and had declined to the previous circulation of the daily herald ( 1.2 million ) within a few weeks .
on the day of the abdication , the oireachtas , the parliament of the irish free state , removed all direct mention of the monarch from the irish constitution . the next day , it passed the external relations act , which gave the monarch limited authority ( strictly on the advice of the government ) to appoint diplomatic representatives for ireland and to be involved in the making of foreign treaties . the two acts made the irish free state a republic in essence without removing its links to the commonwealth .
early progress toward the development of vaccines occurred throughout this period , primarily in the form of academic and government-funded basic research directed toward the identification of the pathogens responsible for common communicable diseases . in 1885 louis pasteur and pierre paul emile roux created the first rabies vaccine . the first diphtheria vaccines were produced in 1914 from a mixture of diphtheria toxin and antitoxin ( produced from the serum of an inoculated animal ) , but the safety of the inoculation was marginal and it was not widely used . the united states recorded 206,000 cases of diphtheria in 1921 resulting in 15,520 deaths . in 1923 parallel efforts by gaston ramon at the pasteur institute and alexander glenny at the wellcome research laboratories ( later part of glaxosmithkline ) led to the discovery that a safer vaccine could be produced by treating diphtheria toxin with formaldehyde . in 1944 , maurice hilleman of squibb pharmaceuticals developed the first vaccine against japanese encephelitis . hilleman would later move to merck where he would play a key role in the development of vaccines against measles , mumps , chickenpox , rubella , hepatitis a , hepatitis b , and meningitis .
idris ' government was increasingly unpopular by the latter 1960s ; it had exacerbated libya 's traditional regional and tribal divisions by centralising the country 's federal system in order to take advantage of the country 's oil wealth , while corruption and entrenched systems of patronage were widespread throughout the oil industry . arab nationalism was increasingly popular , and protests flared up following egypt 's 1967 defeat in the six-day war with israel ; allied to the western powers , idris ' administration was seen as pro-israeli . anti-western riots broke out in tripoli and benghazi , while libyan workers shut down oil terminals in solidarity with egypt . by 1969 , the u.s. central intelligence agency was expecting segments of libya 's armed forces to launch a coup . although claims have been made that they knew of gaddafi 's free officers movement , they have since claimed ignorance , stating that they were monitoring abdul aziz shalhi 's black boots revolutionary group .
during the years 1940-1955 , the rate of decline in the u.s. death rate accelerated from 2 % per year to 8 % per year , then returned to the historical rate of 2 % per year . the dramatic decline in the immediate post-war years has been attributed to the rapid development of new treatments and vaccines for infectious disease that occurred during these years . vaccine development continued to accelerate , with the most notable achievement of the period being jonas salk 's 1954 development of the polio vaccine under the funding of the non-profit national foundation for infantile paralysis . the vaccine process was never patented , but was instead given to pharmaceutical companies to manufacture as a low-cost generic . in 1960 maurice hilleman of merck sharp & dohme identified the sv40 virus , which was later shown to cause tumors in many mammalian species . it was later determined that sv40 was present as a contaminant in polio vaccine lots that had been administered to 90 % of the children in the united states . the contamination appears to have originated both in the original cell stock and in monkey tissue used for production . in 2004 the united states cancer institute announced that it had concluded that sv40 is not associated with cancer in people .
arts & sciences at washington university comprises three divisions : the college of arts & sciences , the graduate school of arts & sciences , and university college in arts & sciences . barbara schaal is dean of the faculty of arts & sciences . james e. mcleod was the vice chancellor for students and dean of the college of arts & sciences ; according to a university news release he died at the university 's barnes-jewish hospital on tuesday , september 6 , 2011 of renal failure as a result of a two-year-long struggle with cancer . richard j. smith is dean of the graduate school of arts & sciences .
the government , consisting of the monarch and the ministers , will then usually approve the proposal and the sovereign and one of the ministers signs the proposal with the addition of an enacting clause , thereafter notifying the states general that " the king assents to the proposal . " it has happened in exceptional circumstances that the government does not approve a law that has been passed in parliament . in such a case , neither the monarch nor a minister will sign the bill , notifying the states general that " the king will keep the proposal under advisement . " a law that has received royal assent will be published in the state magazine , with the original being kept in the archives of the king 's offices .
beer contains ethyl alcohol , the same chemical that is present in wine and distilled spirits and as such , beer consumption has short-term psychological and physiological effects on the user . different concentrations of alcohol in the human body have different effects on a person . the effects of alcohol depend on the amount an individual has drunk , the percentage of alcohol in the beer and the timespan that the consumption took place , the amount of food eaten and whether an individual has taken other prescription , over-the-counter or street drugs , among other factors . drinking enough to cause a blood alcohol concentration ( bac ) of 0.03 % -0.12 % typically causes an overall improvement in mood and possible euphoria , increased self-confidence and sociability , decreased anxiety , a flushed , red appearance in the face and impaired judgment and fine muscle coordination . a bac of 0.09 % to 0.25 % causes lethargy , sedation , balance problems and blurred vision . a bac from 0.18 % to 0.30 % causes profound confusion , impaired speech ( e.g. , slurred speech ) , staggering , dizziness and vomiting . a bac from 0.25 % to 0.40 % causes stupor , unconsciousness , anterograde amnesia , vomiting ( death may occur due to inhalation of vomit ( pulmonary aspiration ) while unconscious and respiratory depression ( potentially life-threatening ) . a bac from 0.35 % to 0.80 % causes a coma ( unconsciousness ) , life-threatening respiratory depression and possibly fatal alcohol poisoning . as with all alcoholic drinks , drinking while driving , operating an aircraft or heavy machinery increases the risk of an accident ; many countries have penalties against drunk driving .
the platyzoa include the phylum platyhelminthes , the flatworms . these were originally considered some of the most primitive bilateria , but it now appears they developed from more complex ancestors . a number of parasites are included in this group , such as the flukes and tapeworms . flatworms are acoelomates , lacking a body cavity , as are their closest relatives , the microscopic gastrotricha . the other platyzoan phyla are mostly microscopic and pseudocoelomate . the most prominent are the rotifera or rotifers , which are common in aqueous environments . they also include the acanthocephala or spiny-headed worms , the gnathostomulida , micrognathozoa , and possibly the cycliophora . these groups share the presence of complex jaws , from which they are called the gnathifera .
in the late 1980s , according to " richard feynman and the connection machine , " feynman played a crucial role in developing the first massively parallel computer , and in finding innovative uses for it in numerical computations , in building neural networks , as well as physical simulations using cellular automata ( such as turbulent fluid flow ) , working with stephen wolfram at caltech . his son carl also played a role in the development of the original connection machine engineering ; feynman influencing the interconnects while his son worked on the software .
london contains four world heritage sites : the tower of london ; kew gardens ; the site comprising the palace of westminster , westminster abbey , and st margaret 's church ; and the historic settlement of greenwich ( in which the royal observatory , greenwich marks the prime meridian , 0 ° longitude , and gmt ) . other famous landmarks include buckingham palace , the london eye , piccadilly circus , st paul 's cathedral , tower bridge , trafalgar square , and the shard . london is home to numerous museums , galleries , libraries , sporting events and other cultural institutions , including the british museum , national gallery , tate modern , british library and 40 west end theatres . the london underground is the oldest underground railway network in the world .
from its discovery in 1846 until the subsequent discovery of pluto in 1930 , neptune was the farthest known planet . when pluto was discovered it was considered a planet , and neptune thus became the penultimate known planet , except for a 20-year period between 1979 and 1999 when pluto 's elliptical orbit brought it closer to the sun than neptune . the discovery of the kuiper belt in 1992 led many astronomers to debate whether pluto should be considered a planet or as part of the kuiper belt . in 2006 , the international astronomical union defined the word " planet " for the first time , reclassifying pluto as a " dwarf planet " and making neptune once again the outermost known planet in the solar system .
the germans expected to negotiate an end to the war but immediately ordered an advance on paris ; by 15 september moltke issued the orders for an investment of paris and on 20 september the encirclement was complete . bismarck met favre on 18 september at the chateau de ferrieres and demanded a frontier immune to a french war of revenge , which included strasbourg , alsace and most the moselle department in lorraine of which metz was the capital . in return for an armistice for the french to elect a national assembly , bismarck demanded the surrender of strasbourg and the fortress city of toul . to allow supplies into paris , one of the perimeter forts had to be handed over . favre was unaware that the real aim of bismarck in making such extortionate demands was to establish a durable peace on the new western frontier of germany , preferably by a peace with a friendly government , on terms acceptable to french public opinion . an impregnable military frontier was an inferior alternative to him , favoured only by the militant nationalists on the german side .
since the system 's launch , production costs have been reduced significantly as a result of phasing out the emotion engine chip and falling hardware costs . the cost of manufacturing cell microprocessors has fallen dramatically as a result of moving to the 65 nm production process , and blu-ray disc diodes have become cheaper to manufacture . as of january 2008 , each unit cost around $ 400 to manufacture ; by august 2009 , sony had reduced costs by a total of 70 % , meaning it only costs sony around $ 240 per unit .
red is one of the most common colors used on national flags . the use of red has similar connotations from country to country : the blood , sacrifice , and courage of those who defended their country ; the sun and the hope and warmth it brings ; and the sacrifice of christ 's blood ( in some historically christian nations ) are a few examples . red is the color of the flags of several countries that once belonged to the former british empire . the british flag bears the colors red , white , and blue ; it includes the cross of saint george , patron saint of england , and the saltire of saint patrick , patron saint of ireland , both of which are red on white . the flag of the united states bears the colors of britain , the colors of the french tricolore include red as part of the old paris coat of arms , and other countries ' flags , such as those of australia , new zealand , and fiji , carry a small inset of the british flag in memory of their ties to that country . many former colonies of spain , such as mexico , colombia , ecuador , cuba , puerto rico , peru , and venezuela , also feature red-one of the colors of the spanish flag-on their own banners . red flags are also used to symbolize storms , bad water conditions , and many other dangers . navy flags are often red and yellow . red is prominently featured in the flag of the united states marine corps .
kerry 's commanding officer , lieutenant commander george elliott , stated to douglas brinkley in 2003 that he did not know whether to court-martial kerry for beaching the boat without orders or give him a medal for saving the crew . elliott recommended kerry for the silver star , and zumwalt flew into an thoi to personally award medals to kerry and the rest of the sailors involved in the mission . the navy 's account of kerry 's actions is presented in the original medal citation signed by zumwalt . the engagement was documented in an after-action report , a press release written on march 1 , 1969 , and a historical summary dated march 17 , 1969 .
in december 1993 , the famicom received a similar redesign . it also loads cartridges through a covered slot on the top of the unit and uses non-hardwired controllers . because hvc-101 used composite video output instead of being rf only like the hvc-001 , nintendo marketed the newer model as the av famicom ( av仕様ファミコン , eibui shiyo famikon ? ) . since the new controllers don 't have microphones on them like the second controller on the original console , certain games such as the disk system version of the legend of zelda and raid on bungeling bay will have certain tricks that cannot be replicated when played on an hvc-101 famicom without a modded controller . however , the hvc-101 famicom is compatible with most nes controllers due to having the same controller port . nintendo had also released a 3d graphic capable headset . however , this peripheral was never released outside japan .

simultaneous with israel 's february raid , the baghdad pact was formed between some regional allies of the uk . nasser considered the baghdad pact a threat to his efforts to eliminate british military influence in the middle east , and a mechanism to undermine the arab league and " perpetuate [ arab ] subservience to zionism and [ western ] imperialism . " nasser felt that if he was to maintain egypt 's regional leadership position he needed to acquire modern weaponry to arm his military . when it became apparent to him that western countries would not supply egypt under acceptable financial and military terms , nasser turned to the eastern bloc and concluded a us $ 320,000,000 armaments agreement with czechoslovakia on 27 september . through the czechoslovakian arms deal , the balance of power between egypt and israel was more or less equalized and nasser 's role as the arab leader defying the west was enhanced .
pope sixtus v limited the number of cardinals to 70 , comprising six cardinal bishops , 50 cardinal priests , and 14 cardinal deacons . starting in the pontificate of pope john xxiii , that limit has been exceeded . at the start of 1971 , pope paul vi set the number of cardinal electors at a maximum of 120 , but set no limit on the number of cardinals generally . he also established a maximum age of eighty years for electors . his action deprived twenty-five living cardinals , including the three living cardinals elevated by pope pius xi , of the right to participate in a conclave . [ citation needed ] popes can dispense from church laws and have sometimes brought the number of cardinals under the age of 80 to more than 120 . pope paul vi also increased the number of cardinal bishops by giving that rank to patriarchs of the eastern catholic churches .
southampton was named " fittest city in the uk " in 2006 by men 's fitness magazine . the results were based on the incidence of heart disease , the amount of junk food and alcohol consumed , and the level of gym membership . in 2007 , it had slipped one place behind london , but was still ranked first when it came to the parks and green spaces available for exercise and the amount of television watched by sotonians was the lowest in the country . speedway racing took place at banister court stadium in the pre-war era . it returned in the 1940s after ww2 and the saints operated until the stadium closed down at the end of 1963 . a training track operated in the 1950s in the hamble area .

in about 319 , when athanasius was a deacon , a presbyter named arius came into a direct conflict with alexander of alexandria . it appears that arius reproached alexander for what he felt were misguided or heretical teachings being taught by the bishop . arius 's theological views appear to have been firmly rooted in alexandrian christianity , and his christological views were certainly not radical at all . he embraced a subordinationist christology which taught that christ was the divine son ( logos ) of god , made , not begotten , heavily influenced by alexandrian thinkers like origen , and which was a common christological view in alexandria at the time . support for arius from powerful bishops like eusebius of caesarea and eusebius of nicomedia , further illustrate how arius 's subordinationist christology was shared by other christians in the empire . arius was subsequently excommunicated by alexander , and he would begin to elicit the support of many bishops who agreed with his position .
among all 17 railway stations in nanjing , passenger rail service is mainly provided by nanjing railway station and nanjing south railway station , while other stations like nanjing west railway station , zhonghuamen railway station and xianlin railway station serve minor roles . nanjing railway station was first built in 1968 . in 1999 , on november 12 , 1999 , the station was burnt in a serious fire . reconstruction of the station was finished on september 1 , 2005 . nanjing south railway station , which is one of the 5 hub stations on beijing-shanghai high-speed railway , has officially been claimed as the largest railway station in asia and the second largest in the world in terms of gfa ( gross floor area ) . construction of nanjing south station began on 10 january 2008 . the station was opened for public service in 2011 .
other major newspapers include miami today , headquartered in brickell , miami new times , headquartered in midtown , miami sun post , south florida business journal , miami times , and biscayne boulevard times . an additional spanish-language newspapers , diario las americas also serve miami . the miami herald is miami 's primary newspaper with over a million readers and is headquartered in downtown in herald plaza . several other student newspapers from the local universities , such as the oldest , the university of miami 's the miami hurricane , florida international university 's the beacon , miami-dade college 's the metropolis , barry university 's the buccaneer , amongst others . many neighborhoods and neighboring areas also have their own local newspapers such as the aventura news , coral gables tribune , biscayne bay tribune , and the palmetto bay news .
in 1997 , the vienna philharmonic was " facing protests during a [ us ] tour " by the national organization for women and the international alliance for women in music . finally , " after being held up to increasing ridicule even in socially conservative austria , members of the orchestra gathered [ on 28 february 1997 ] in an extraordinary meeting on the eve of their departure and agreed to admit a woman , anna lelkes , as harpist . " as of 2013 , the orchestra has six female members ; one of them , violinist albena danailova became one of the orchestra 's concertmasters in 2008 , the first woman to hold that position . in 2012 , women still made up just 6 % of the orchestra 's membership . vpo president clemens hellsberg said the vpo now uses completely screened blind auditions .
in the 2000 presidential election , vice president al gore , a former democratic u.s. senator from tennessee , failed to carry his home state , an unusual occurrence but indicative of strengthening republican support . republican george w. bush received increased support in 2004 , with his margin of victory in the state increasing from 4 % in 2000 to 14 % in 2004 . democratic presidential nominees from southern states ( such as lyndon b. johnson , jimmy carter , bill clinton ) usually fare better than their northern counterparts do in tennessee , especially among split-ticket voters outside the metropolitan areas .
the central oscillator generates a self-sustaining rhythm and is driven by two interacting feedback loops that are active at different times of day . the morning loop consists of cca1 ( circadian and clock-associated 1 ) and lhy ( late elongated hypocotyl ) , which encode closely related myb transcription factors that regulate circadian rhythms in arabidopsis , as well as prr 7 and 9 ( pseudo-response regulators . ) the evening loop consists of gi ( gigantea ) and elf4 , both involved in regulation of flowering time genes . when cca1 and lhy are overexpressed ( under constant light or dark conditions ) , plants become arrhythmic , and mrna signals reduce , contributing to a negative feedback loop . gene expression of cca1 and lhy oscillates and peaks in the early morning , whereas toc1 gene expression oscillates and peaks in the early evening . while it was previously hypothesised that these three genes model a negative feedback loop in which over-expressed cca1 and lhy repress toc1 and over-expressed toc1 is a positive regulator of cca1 and lhy , it was shown in 2012 by andrew millar and others that toc1 in fact serves as a repressor not only of cca1 , lhy , and prr7 and 9 in the morning loop but also of gi and elf4 in the evening loop . this finding and further computational modeling of toc1 gene functions and interactions suggest a reframing of the plant circadian clock as a triple negative-component repressilator model rather than the positive / negative-element feedback loop characterizing the clock in mammals .
the times commissioned the serif typeface times new roman , created by victor lardent at the english branch of monotype , in 1931 . it was commissioned after stanley morison had written an article criticizing the times for being badly printed and typographically antiquated . the font was supervised by morison and drawn by victor lardent , an artist from the advertising department of the times . morison used an older font named plantin as the basis for his design , but made revisions for legibility and economy of space . times new roman made its debut in the issue of 3 october 1932 . after one year , the design was released for commercial sale . the times stayed with times new roman for 40 years , but new production techniques and the format change from broadsheet to tabloid in 2004 have caused the newspaper to switch font five times since 1972 . however , all the new fonts have been variants of the original new roman font :
greece played a peripheral role in the war . when russia attacked the ottoman empire in 1853 , king otto of greece saw an opportunity to expand north and south into ottoman areas that had large greek christian majorities . however , greece did not coordinate its plans with russia , did not declare war , and received no outside military or financial support . greece , an orthodox nation , had considerable support in russia , but the russian government decided it was too dangerous to help greece expand its holdings . : 32-40 when the russians invaded the principalities , the ottoman forces were tied down so greece invaded thessaly and epirus . to block further greek moves , the british and french occupied the main greek port at piraeus from april 1854 to february 1857 , and effectively neutralized the greek army . greeks , gambling on a russian victory , incited the large-scale epirus revolt of 1854 as well as uprisings in crete . the insurrections were failures that were easily crushed by the ottoman army . greece was not invited to the peace conference and made no gains out of the war . : 139 the frustrated greek leadership blamed the king for failing to take advantage of the situation ; his popularity plunged and he was later forced to abdicate .
in 1958 , the soviet union developed тransformator ( russian : трансформатор , meaning transformer ) , the first high-resolution ( definition ) television system capable of producing an image composed of 1,125 lines of resolution aimed at providing teleconferencing for military command . it was a research project and the system was never deployed by either the military or consumer broadcasting .
in 2005 , the office of fair trading found fifty independent schools , including eton , to have breached the competition act by " regularly and systematically " exchanging information about planned increases in school fees , which was collated and distributed among the schools by the bursar at sevenoaks school . following the investigation by the oft , each school was required to pay around £ 70,000 , totalling around £ 3.5 million , significantly less than the maximum possible fine . in addition , the schools together agreed to contribute another £ 3m to a new charitable educational fund . the incident raised concerns over whether the charitable status of independent schools such as eton should be reconsidered , and perhaps revoked . however , jean scott , the head of the independent schools council , said that independent schools had always been exempt from anti-cartel rules applied to business , were following a long-established procedure in sharing the information with each other , and that they were unaware of the change to the law ( on which they had not been consulted ) . she wrote to john vickers , the oft director-general , saying , " they are not a group of businessmen meeting behind closed doors to fix the price of their products to the disadvantage of the consumer . they are schools that have quite openly continued to follow a long-established practice because they were unaware that the law had changed . "
in france , offshoots of cubism developed , including orphism , abstract art and later purism . in other countries futurism , suprematism , dada , constructivism and de stijl developed in response to cubism . early futurist paintings hold in common with cubism the fusing of the past and the present , the representation of different views of the subject pictured at the same time , also called multiple perspective , simultaneity or multiplicity , while constructivism was influenced by picasso 's technique of constructing sculpture from separate elements . other common threads between these disparate movements include the faceting or simplification of geometric forms , and the association of mechanization and modern life .
in kazakhstan on june 19 , 1989 , young men carrying guns , firebombs , iron bars and stones rioted in zhanaozen , causing a number of deaths . the youths tried to seize a police station and a water-supply station . they brought public transportation to a halt and shut down various shops and industries . by june 25 , the rioting had spread to five other towns near the caspian sea . a mob of about 150 people armed with sticks , stones and metal rods attacked the police station in mangishlak , about 90 miles from zhanaozen , before they were dispersed by government troops flown in by helicopters . mobs of young people also rampaged through yeraliev , shepke , fort-shevchenko and kulsary , where they poured flammable liquid on trains housing temporary workers and set them on fire .
new york city 's commuter rail network is the largest in north america . the rail network , connecting new york city to its suburbs , consists of the long island rail road , metro-north railroad , and new jersey transit . the combined systems converge at grand central terminal and pennsylvania station and contain more than 250 stations and 20 rail lines . in queens , the elevated airtrain people mover system connects jfk international airport to the new york city subway and the long island rail road ; a separate airtrain system is planned alongside the grand central parkway to connect laguardia airport to these transit systems . for intercity rail , new york city is served by amtrak , whose busiest station by a significant margin is pennsylvania station on the west side of manhattan , from which amtrak provides connections to boston , philadelphia , and washington , d.c. along the northeast corridor , as well as long-distance train service to other north american cities .
in prokaryotes , transcription occurs in the cytoplasm ; for very long transcripts , translation may begin at the 5 ' end of the rna while the 3 ' end is still being transcribed . in eukaryotes , transcription occurs in the nucleus , where the cell 's dna is stored . the rna molecule produced by the polymerase is known as the primary transcript and undergoes post-transcriptional modifications before being exported to the cytoplasm for translation . one of the modifications performed is the splicing of introns which are sequences in the transcribed region that do not encode protein . alternative splicing mechanisms can result in mature transcripts from the same gene having different sequences and thus coding for different proteins . this is a major form of regulation in eukaryotic cells and also occurs in some prokaryotes . : 7.5
in 1986 , eight years before the launch of turner classic movies , ted turner acquired the metro-goldwyn-mayer film studio for $ 1.5 billion . concerns over turner entertainment 's corporate debt load resulted in turner selling the studio that october back to kirk kerkorian , from whom turner had purchased the studio less than a year before . as part of the deal , turner entertainment retained ownership of mgm 's library of films released up to may 9 , 1986 . turner broadcasting system was split into two companies ; turner broadcasting system and metro-goldwyn-mayer and reincorporated as mgm / ua communications co .
after germany invaded the soviet union on 22 june 1941 , the wehrmacht crossed the estonian southern border on 7 july . the red army retreated behind the parnu river - emajogi line on 12 july . at the end of july the germans resumed their advance in estonia working in tandem with the estonian forest brothers . both german troops and estonian partisans took narva on 17 august and the estonian capital tallinn on 28 august . after the soviets were driven out from estonia , german troops disarmed all the partisan groups .
romila thapar notes that the division into hindu-muslim-british periods of indian history gives too much weight to " ruling dynasties and foreign invasions , " neglecting the social-economic history which often showed a strong continuity . the division into ancient-medieval-modern periods overlooks the fact that the muslim conquests occurred gradually during which time many things came and went off , while the south was never completely conquered . according to thapar , a periodisation could also be based on " significant social and economic changes , " which are not strictly related to a change of ruling powers . [ note 1 ]
modern estonia is a fairly ethnically heterogeneous country , but this heterogeneity is not a feature of much of the country as the non-estonian population is concentrated in two of estonia 's counties . thirteen of estonia 's 15 counties are over 80 % ethnic estonian , the most homogeneous being hiiumaa , where estonians account for 98.4 % of the population . in the counties of harju ( including the capital city , tallinn ) and ida-viru , however , ethnic estonians make up 60 % and 20 % of the population , respectively . russians make up 25.6 % of the total population but account for 36 % of the population in harju county and 70 % of the population in ida-viru county .
another example is the practice of compulsory licensing , which is where the law forbids copyright owners from denying a license for certain uses of certain kinds of works , such as compilations and live performances of music . compulsory licensing laws generally say that for certain uses of certain works , no infringement occurs as long as a royalty , at a rate determined by law rather than private negotiation , is paid to the copyright owner or representative copyright collective . some fair dealing laws , such as canada 's , include similar royalty requirements .
the worship of dynastic ruler cults was also a feature of this period , most notably in egypt , where the ptolemies adopted earlier pharaonic practice , and established themselves as god-kings . these cults were usually associated with a specific temple in honor of the ruler such as the ptolemaieia at alexandria and had their own festivals and theatrical performances . the setting up of ruler cults was more based on the systematized honors offered to the kings ( sacrifice , proskynesis , statues , altars , hymns ) which put them on par with the gods ( isotheism ) than on actual belief of their divine nature . according to peter green , these cults did not produce genuine belief of the divinity of rulers among the greeks and macedonians . the worship of alexander was also popular , as in the long lived cult at erythrae and of course , at alexandria , where his tomb was located .
there is a very active tradition of hunting of small to medium-sized wild game in trinidad and tobago . hunting is carried out with firearms , and aided by the use of hounds , with the illegal use of trap guns , trap cages and snare nets . with approximately 12,000 sport hunters applying for hunting licences in recent years ( in a very small country of about the size of the state of delaware at about 5128 square kilometers and 1.3 million inhabitants ) , there is some concern that the practice might not be sustainable . in addition there are at present no bag limits and the open season is comparatively very long ( 5 months - october to february inclusive ) . as such hunting pressure from legal hunters is very high . added to that , there is a thriving and very lucrative black market for poached wild game ( sold and enthusiastically purchased as expensive luxury delicacies ) and the numbers of commercial poachers in operation is unknown but presumed to be fairly high . as a result , the populations of the five major mammalian game species ( red-rumped agouti , lowland paca , nine-banded armadillo , collared peccary , and red brocket deer ) are thought to be quite low ( although scientifically conducted population studies are only just recently being conducted as of 2013 ) . it appears that the red brocket deer population has been extirpated on tobago as a result of over-hunting . various herons , ducks , doves , the green iguana , the gold tegu , the spectacled caiman and the common opossum are also commonly hunted and poached . there is also some poaching of ' fully protected species ' , including red howler monkeys and capuchin monkeys , southern tamanduas , brazilian porcupines , yellow-footed tortoises , trinidad piping guans and even one of the national birds , the scarlet ibis . legal hunters pay very small fees to obtain hunting licences and undergo no official basic conservation biology or hunting-ethics training . there is presumed to be relatively very little subsistence hunting in the country ( with most hunting for either sport or commercial profit ) . the local wildlife management authority is under-staffed and under-funded , and as such very little in the way of enforcement is done to uphold existing wildlife management laws , with hunting occurring both in and out of season , and even in wildlife sanctuaries . there is some indication that the government is beginning to take the issue of wildlife management more seriously , with well drafted legislation being brought before parliament in 2015 . it remains to be seen if the drafted legislation will be fully adopted and financially supported by the current and future governments , and if the general populace will move towards a greater awareness of the importance of wildlife conservation and change the culture of wanton consumption to one of sustainable management .
modern evolutionary theory continues to develop . darwin 's theory of evolution by natural selection , with its tree-like model of branching common descent , has become the unifying theory of the life sciences . the theory explains the diversity of living organisms and their adaptation to the environment . it makes sense of the geologic record , biogeography , parallels in embryonic development , biological homologies , vestigiality , cladistics , phylogenetics and other fields , with unrivalled explanatory power ; it has also become essential to applied sciences such as medicine and agriculture . despite the scientific consensus , a religion-based political controversy has developed over how evolution is taught in schools , especially in the united states .
in 1993 , the city passed a massive redevelopment package known as the metropolitan area projects ( maps ) , intended to rebuild the city 's core with civic projects to establish more activities and life to downtown . the city added a new baseball park ; central library ; renovations to the civic center , convention center and fairgrounds ; and a water canal in the bricktown entertainment district . water taxis transport passengers within the district , adding color and activity along the canal . maps has become one of the most successful public-private partnerships undertaken in the u.s. , exceeding $ 3 billion in private investment as of 2010 . as a result of maps , the population living in downtown housing has exponentially increased , together with demand for additional residential and retail amenities , such as grocery , services , and shops .
in the light of mother f. a. forbes research and reference to pope saint gregory 's writings , it would appear that athanasius was constrained to be bishop : she writes that when the patriarch alexander was on his death-bed he called athanasius , who fled fearing he would be constrained to be made bishop . " when the bishops of the church assembled to elect their new patriarch , the whole catholic population surrounded the church , holding up their hands to heaven and crying ; " give us athanasius ! " the bishops had nothing better . athanasius was thus elected , as gregory tells us ... " ( pope gregory i , would have full access to the vatican archives ) .
research has generally shown striking uniformity across different cultures in the motives behind teen alcohol use . social engagement and personal enjoyment appear to play a fairly universal role in adolescents ' decision to drink throughout separate cultural contexts . surveys conducted in argentina , hong kong , and canada have each indicated the most common reason for drinking among adolescents to relate to pleasure and recreation ; 80 % of argentinian teens reported drinking for enjoyment , while only 7 % drank to improve a bad mood . the most prevalent answers among canadian adolescents were to " get in a party mood , " 18 % ; " because i enjoy it , " 16 % ; and " to get drunk , " 10 % . in hong kong , female participants most frequently reported drinking for social enjoyment , while males most frequently reported drinking to feel the effects of alcohol .
following the ceasefire agreement that suspended hostilities ( but not officially ended ) in the 1991 gulf war , the united states and its allies instituted and began patrolling iraqi no-fly zones , to protect iraq 's kurdish and shi 'a arab population - both of which suffered attacks from the hussein regime before and after the gulf war - in iraq 's northern and southern regions , respectively . u.s. forces continued in combat zone deployments through november 1995 and launched operation desert fox against iraq in 1998 after it failed to meet u.s. demands of " unconditional cooperation " in weapons inspections .
interstate 40 crosses the state in a west-east orientation . its branch interstate highways include i-240 in memphis ; i-440 in nashville ; i-140 from knoxville to alcoa and i-640 in knoxville . i-26 , although technically an east-west interstate , runs from the north carolina border below johnson city to its terminus at kingsport . i-24 is an east-west interstate that runs cross-state from chattanooga to clarksville . in a north-south orientation are highways i-55 , i-65 , i-75 , and i-81 . interstate 65 crosses the state through nashville , while interstate 75 serves chattanooga and knoxville and interstate 55 serves memphis . interstate 81 enters the state at bristol and terminates at its junction with i-40 near dandridge . i-155 is a branch highway from i-55 . the only spur highway of i-75 in tennessee is i-275 , which is in knoxville . when completed , i-69 will travel through the western part of the state , from south fulton to memphis . a branch interstate , i-269 also exists from millington to collierville .
the scottish traveler james bruce reported in 1770 that medri bahri was a distinct political entity from abyssinia , noting that the two territories were frequently in conflict . the bahre-nagassi ( " kings of the sea " ) alternately fought with or against the abyssinians and the neighbouring muslim adal sultanate depending on the geopolitical circumstances . medri bahri was thus part of the christian resistance against imam ahmad ibn ibrahim al-ghazi of adal 's forces , but later joined the adalite states and the ottoman empire front against abyssinia in 1572 . that 16th century also marked the arrival of the ottomans , who began making inroads in the red sea area .
the state seemed at relative calm compared to the rest of the country due to its close ties to the united states until 1841 . in 1843 the possibility of war was anticipated by the state government and it began to reinforce the defense lines along the political boundary with texas . supplies of weapons were sent to fully equip the military and took steps to improve efficiency at the presidios . later , the regimen for the defenders of the border were organized by the state which were made up of : light cavalry , four squads of two brigades , and a small force of 14 men and 42 officials at the price of 160,603 pesos per year . during the beginning of the 1840s , private citizens took it upon themselves to stop the commercial caravans of supplies from the united states , but being so far away from the large suppliers in central mexico the caravan was allowed to continue in march 1844 . continuing to anticipate a war , the state legislature on july 11 , 1846 by decree enlisted 6,000 men to serve along the border ; during that time angel trias quickly rose to power by portraying zealous anti-american rhetoric . trias took the opportunity to dedicate important state resources to gain economic concessions from the people and loans from many municipalities in preparation to defend the state ; he used all the money he received to equip and organize a large volunteer militia . angel trias took measures for state self-dependence in regards to state militia due to the diminishing financial support from the federal government .
it should be emphasized , however , that for whitehead god is not necessarily tied to religion . rather than springing primarily from religious faith , whitehead saw god as necessary for his metaphysical system . his system required that an order exist among possibilities , an order that allowed for novelty in the world and provided an aim to all entities . whitehead posited that these ordered potentials exist in what he called the primordial nature of god . however , whitehead was also interested in religious experience . this led him to reflect more intensively on what he saw as the second nature of god , the consequent nature . whitehead 's conception of god as a " dipolar " entity has called for fresh theological thinking .
after the formal end of reconstruction , the struggle over power in southern society continued . through violence and intimidation against freedmen and their allies , white democrats regained political power in tennessee and other states across the south in the late 1870s and 1880s . over the next decade , the state legislature passed increasingly restrictive laws to control african americans . in 1889 the general assembly passed four laws described as electoral reform , with the cumulative effect of essentially disfranchising most african americans in rural areas and small towns , as well as many poor whites . legislation included implementation of a poll tax , timing of registration , and recording requirements . tens of thousands of taxpaying citizens were without representation for decades into the 20th century . disfranchising legislation accompanied jim crow laws passed in the late 19th century , which imposed segregation in the state . in 1900 , african americans made up nearly 24 % of the state 's population , and numbered 480,430 citizens who lived mostly in the central and western parts of the state .
the marxist critique of capitalism - developed with friedrich engels - was , alongside liberalism and fascism , one of the defining ideological movements of the twentieth century . the industrial revolution produced a parallel revolution in political thought . urbanization and capitalism greatly reshaped society . during this same period , the socialist movement began to form . in the mid-19th century , marxism was developed , and socialism in general gained increasing popular support , mostly from the urban working class . without breaking entirely from the past , marx established principles that would be used by future revolutionaries of the 20th century namely vladimir lenin , mao zedong , ho chi minh , and fidel castro . though hegel 's philosophy of history is similar to immanuel kant 's , and karl marx 's theory of revolution towards the common good is partly based on kant 's view of history - marx declared that he was turning hegel 's dialectic , which was " standing on its head , " " the right side up again . " unlike marx who believed in historical materialism , hegel believed in the phenomenology of spirit . by the late 19th century , socialism and trade unions were established members of the political landscape . in addition , the various branches of anarchism , with thinkers such as mikhail bakunin , pierre-joseph proudhon or peter kropotkin , and syndicalism also gained some prominence . in the anglo-american world , anti-imperialism and pluralism began gaining currency at the turn of the 20th century .
shih-shan henry tsai writes that the yongle emperor sent his eunuch yang sanbao into tibet in 1413 to gain the allegiance of various tibetan princes , while the yongle emperor paid a small fortune in return gifts for tributes in order to maintain the loyalty of neighboring vassal states such as nepal and tibet . however , van praag states that tibetan rulers upheld their own separate relations with the kingdoms of nepal and kashmir , and at times " engaged in armed confrontation with them . "
in response to these hardware flaws , " nintendo authorized repair centers " sprang up across the u.s. according to nintendo , the authorization program was designed to ensure that the machines were properly repaired . nintendo would ship the necessary replacement parts only to shops that had enrolled in the authorization program . in practice , the authorization process consisted of nothing more than paying a fee to nintendo for the privilege . in a recent trend , many sites have sprung up to offer nintendo repair parts , guides , and services that replace those formerly offered by the authorized repair centers .
a 5th-century building in huldah may be a samaritan synagogue . its mosaic floor contains typical jewish symbols ( menorah , lulav , etrog ) but the inscriptions are greek . another samaritan synagogue with a mosaic floor was located in bet she 'an ( excavated in 1960 ) . the floor had only decorative motifs and an aedicule ( shrine ) with cultic symbols . the ban on human or animal images was more strictly observed by the samaritans than their jewish neighbours in the same town ( see above ) . the mosaic was laid by the same masters who made the floor of the beit alfa synagogue . one of the inscriptions was written in samaritan script .
in 2010 piraeus handled 513,319 teus , followed by thessaloniki , which handled 273,282 teus . in the same year , 83.9 million people passed through greece 's ports , 12.7 million through the port of paloukia in salamis , another 12.7 through the port of perama , 9.5 million through piraeus and 2.7 million through igoumenitsa . in 2013 , piraeus handled a record 3.16 million teus , the third-largest figure in the mediterranean , of which 2.52 million were transported through pier ii , owned by cosco and 644,000 were transported through pier i , owned by the greek state .
the dominican friars quickly spread , including to england , where they appeared in oxford in 1221 . in the 13th century the order reached all classes of christian society , fought heresy , schism , and paganism by word and book , and by its missions to the north of europe , to africa , and asia passed beyond the frontiers of christendom . its schools spread throughout the entire church ; its doctors wrote monumental works in all branches of knowledge , including the extremely important albertus magnus and thomas aquinas . its members included popes , cardinals , bishops , legates , inquisitors , confessors of princes , ambassadors , and paciarii ( enforcers of the peace decreed by popes or councils ) . the order was appointed by pope gregory ix the duty to carry out the inquisition . in his papal bull ad extirpanda of 1252 , pope innocent iv authorised the dominicans ' use of torture under prescribed circumstances .
the rule of law has been considered as one of the key dimensions that determine the quality and good governance of a country . research , like the worldwide governance indicators , defines the rule of law as : " the extent to which agents have confidence and abide by the rules of society , and in particular the quality of contract enforcement , the police and the courts , as well as the likelihood of crime or violence . " based on this definition the worldwide governance indicators project has developed aggregate measurements for the rule of law in more than 200 countries , as seen in the map below . a government based on the rule of law can be called a " nomocracy , " from the greek nomos ( law ) and kratos ( power or rule ) .
the times magazine features columns touching on various subjects such as celebrities , fashion and beauty , food and drink , homes and gardens or simply writers ' anecdotes . notable contributors include giles coren , food and drink writer of the year in 2005 and nadiya hussain , winner of bbc 's the great british bake off .
firstly , flanking the open reading frame , all genes contain a regulatory sequence that is required for their expression . in order to be expressed , genes require a promoter sequence . the promoter is recognized and bound by transcription factors and rna polymerase to initiate transcription . : 7.1 a gene can have more than one promoter , resulting in messenger rnas ( mrna ) that differ in how far they extend in the 5 ' end . promoter regions have a consensus sequence , however highly transcribed genes have " strong " promoter sequences that bind the transcription machinery well , whereas others have " weak " promoters that bind poorly and initiate transcription less frequently . : 7.2 eukaryotic promoter regions are much more complex and difficult to identify than prokaryotic promoters . : 7.3
as sun-god and god of light , apollo was also known by the epithets aegletes ( / əˈɡliːtiːz / ə-glee-teez ; αιγλητης , aigletes , from αιγλη , " light of the sun " ) , helius ( / ˈhiːliəs / hee-lee-əs ; ηλιος , helios , literally " sun " ) , phanaeus ( / fəˈniːəs / fə-nee-əs ; φαναιος , phanaios , literally " giving or bringing light " ) , and lyceus ( / laɪˈsiːəs / ly-see-əs ; λυκειος , lykeios , from proto-greek * λυκη , " light " ) . the meaning of the epithet " lyceus " later became associated with apollo 's mother leto , who was the patron goddess of lycia ( λυκια ) and who was identified with the wolf ( λυκος ) , earning him the epithets lycegenes ( / laɪˈsɛdʒəniːz / ly-sej-ə-neez ; λυκηγενης , lukegenes , literally " born of a wolf " or " born of lycia " ) and lycoctonus ( / laɪˈkɒktənəs / ly-kok-tə-nəs ; λυκοκτονος , lykoktonos , from λυκος , " wolf , " and κτεινειν , " to kill " ) . as god of the sun , apollo was called sol ( / ˈsɒl / sol , literally " sun " in latin ) by the romans .
in india , the supreme court of india was created on january 28 , 1950 after adoption of the constitution . article 141 of the constitution of india states that the law declared by supreme court is to be binding on all courts within the territory of india . it is the highest court in india and has ultimate judicial authority to interpret the constitution and decide questions of national law ( including local bylaws ) . the supreme court is also vested with the power of judicial review to ensure the application of the rule of law .
in september 2013 , west was widely rebuked by human rights groups for performing in kazakhstan at the wedding of authoritarian president nursultan nazarbayev 's grandson . he traveled to kazakhstan , which has one of the poorest human rights records in the world , as a personal guest of nazarbayev . other notable western performers , including sting , have previously cancelled performances in the country over human rights concerns . west was reportedly paid us $ 3 million for his performance . west had previously participated in cultural boycotts , joining shakira and rage against the machine in refusing to perform in arizona after the 2010 implementation of stop and search laws directed against potential illegal aliens .
knights grand cross and knights commander prefix sir , and dames grand cross and dames commander prefix dame , to their forenames . [ b ] wives of knights may prefix lady to their surnames , but no equivalent privilege exists for husbands of knights or spouses of dames . such forms are not used by peers and princes , except when the names of the former are written out in their fullest forms . clergy of the church of england or the church of scotland do not use the title sir or dame as they do not receive the accolade ( i.e. , they are not dubbed " knight " with a sword ) , although they do append the post-nominal letters .
another limitation of current u.s. intellectual property legislation is its focus on individual and joint works ; thus , copyright protection can only be obtained in ' original ' works of authorship . this definition excludes any works that are the result of community creativity , for example native american songs and stories ; current legislation does not recognize the uniqueness of indigenous cultural " property " and its ever-changing nature . simply asking native cultures to ' write down ' their cultural artifacts on tangible mediums ignores their necessary orality and enforces a western bias of the written form as more authoritative .
the territory of modern-day mexico was home to numerous indigenous civilizations prior to the arrival of the spanish conquistadores : the olmecs , who flourished from between 1200 bce to about 400 bce in the coastal regions of the gulf of mexico ; the zapotecs and the mixtecs , who held sway in the mountains of oaxaca and the isthmus of tehuantepec ; the maya in the yucatan ( and into neighbouring areas of contemporary central america ) ; the purepecha in present-day michoacan and surrounding areas , and the aztecs / mexica , who , from their central capital at tenochtitlan , dominated much of the centre and south of the country ( and the non-aztec inhabitants of those areas ) when hernan cortes first landed at veracruz .
four major am radio stations based in or near ann arbor are waam 1600 , a conservative news and talk station ; wlby 1290 , a business news and talk station ; wdeo 990 , catholic radio ; and wtka 1050 , which is primarily a sports station . the city 's fm stations include npr affiliate wuom 91.7 ; country station wwww 102.9 ; and adult-alternative station wqkl 107.1 . freeform station wcbn-fm 88.3 is a local community radio / college radio station operated by the students of the university of michigan featuring noncommercial , eclectic music and public-affairs programming . the city is also served by public and commercial radio broadcasters in ypsilanti , the lansing / jackson area , detroit , windsor , and toledo .
replicated cds are mass-produced initially using a hydraulic press . small granules of heated raw polycarbonate plastic are fed into the press . a screw forces the liquefied plastic into the mold cavity . the mold closes with a metal stamper in contact with the disc surface . the plastic is allowed to cool and harden . once opened , the disc substrate is removed from the mold by a robotic arm , and a 15 mm diameter center hole ( called a stacking ring ) is created . the time it takes to " stamp " one cd is usually two to three seconds .
melbourne 's rich and diverse literary history was recognised in 2008 when it became the second unesco city of literature . the state library of victoria is one of australia 's oldest cultural institutions and one of many public and university libraries across the city . melbourne also has australia 's widest range of bookstores , as well the nation 's largest publishing sector . the city is home to significant writers ' festivals , most notably the melbourne writers festival . several major literary prizes are open to local writers including the melbourne prize for literature and the victorian premier 's literary awards . significant novels set in melbourne include fergus hume 's the mystery of a hansom cab , helen garner 's monkey grip and christos tsiolkas ' the slap . notable writers and poets from melbourne include thomas browne , c. j. dennis , germaine greer and peter carey .
in kazakhstan on june 19 , 1989 , young men carrying guns , firebombs , iron bars and stones rioted in zhanaozen , causing a number of deaths . the youths tried to seize a police station and a water-supply station . they brought public transportation to a halt and shut down various shops and industries . by june 25 , the rioting had spread to five other towns near the caspian sea . a mob of about 150 people armed with sticks , stones and metal rods attacked the police station in mangishlak , about 90 miles from zhanaozen , before they were dispersed by government troops flown in by helicopters . mobs of young people also rampaged through yeraliev , shepke , fort-shevchenko and kulsary , where they poured flammable liquid on trains housing temporary workers and set them on fire .
unlike in westminster style legislatures or as with the senate majority leader , the house majority leader 's duties and prominence vary depending upon the style and power of the speaker of the house . typically , the speaker does not participate in debate and rarely votes on the floor . in some cases , majority leaders have been more influential than the speaker ; notably tom delay who was more prominent than speaker dennis hastert . in addition , speaker newt gingrich delegated to dick armey an unprecedented level of authority over scheduling legislation on the house floor .
the exclusion of social and political groups as targets of genocide in the cppcg legal definition has been criticized by some historians and sociologists , for example m. hassan kakar in his book the soviet invasion and the afghan response , 1979-1982 argues that the international definition of genocide is too restricted , and that it should include political groups or any group so defined by the perpetrator and quotes chalk and jonassohn : " genocide is a form of one-sided mass killing in which a state or other authority intends to destroy a group , as that group and membership in it are defined by the perpetrator . " while there are various definitions of the term , adam jones states that the majority of genocide scholars consider that " intent to destroy " is a requirement for any act to be labelled genocide , and that there is growing agreement on the inclusion of the physical destruction criterion .
mimicry is a related phenomenon where an organism has a similar appearance to another species . one such example is the drone fly , which looks a lot like a bee , yet is completely harmless as it cannot sting at all . another example of batesian mimicry is the io moth , ( automeris io ) , which has markings on its wings that resemble an owl 's eyes . when an insectivorous predator disturbs the moth , it reveals its hind wings , temporarily startling the predator and giving it time to escape . predators may also use mimicry to lure their prey , however . female fireflies of the genus photuris , for example , copy the light signals of other species , thereby attracting male fireflies , which are then captured and eaten ( see aggressive mimicry ) .
domesticated birds raised for meat and eggs , called poultry , are the largest source of animal protein eaten by humans ; in 2003 , 76 million tons of poultry and 61 million tons of eggs were produced worldwide . chickens account for much of human poultry consumption , though domesticated turkeys , ducks , and geese are also relatively common . many species of birds are also hunted for meat . bird hunting is primarily a recreational activity except in extremely undeveloped areas . the most important birds hunted in north and south america are waterfowl ; other widely hunted birds include pheasants , wild turkeys , quail , doves , partridge , grouse , snipe , and woodcock . muttonbirding is also popular in australia and new zealand . though some hunting , such as that of muttonbirds , may be sustainable , hunting has led to the extinction or endangerment of dozens of species .
tech media website cnet gave new super slim 4 out of 5 stars ( " excellent " ) , saying " the super slim playstation 3 shrinks a powerful gaming machine into an even tinier package while maintaining the same features as its predecessors : a great gaming library and a strong array of streaming services [ ... ] , " whilst also criticising the " cheap " design and disc-loader , stating : " sometimes [ the cover ] doesn 't catch and you feel like you 're using one of those old credit card imprinter machines . in short , it feels cheap . you don 't realize how convenient autoloading disc trays are until they 're gone . whether it was to cut costs or save space , this move is ultimately a step back . " the criticism also was due to price , stating the cheapest super slim model was still more expensive than the cheapest slim model , and that the smaller size and bigger hard drive shouldn 't be considered an upgrade when the hard drive on a slim model is easily removed and replaced . they did praise that the hard drive of the super slim model is " the easiest yet . simply sliding off the side panel reveals the drive bay , which can quickly be unscrewed . " they also stated that whilst the super slim model is not in any way an upgrade , it could be an indicator as to what 's to come . " it may not be revolutionary , but the super slim ps3 is the same impressive machine in a much smaller package . there doesn 't seem to be any reason for existing ps3 owners to upgrade , but for the prospective ps3 buyer , the super slim is probably the way to go if you can deal with not having a slot-loading disc drive . "
science came to play a leading role in enlightenment discourse and thought . many enlightenment writers and thinkers had backgrounds in the sciences and associated scientific advancement with the overthrow of religion and traditional authority in favour of the development of free speech and thought . scientific progress during the enlightenment included the discovery of carbon dioxide ( fixed air ) by the chemist joseph black , the argument for deep time by the geologist james hutton , and the invention of the steam engine by james watt . the experiments of lavoisier were used to create the first modern chemical plants in paris , and the experiments of the montgolfier brothers enabled them to launch the first manned flight in a hot-air balloon on 21 november 1783 , from the chateau de la muette , near the bois de boulogne .
the concept 's origins can potentially be traced back further . jewish law includes several considerations whose effects are similar to those of modern intellectual property laws , though the notion of intellectual creations as property does not seem to exist - notably the principle of hasagat ge 'vul ( unfair encroachment ) was used to justify limited-term publisher ( but not author ) copyright in the 16th century . in 500 bce , the government of the greek state of sybaris offered one year 's patent " to all who should discover any new refinement in luxury . "
in league competitions , games may end in a draw . in knockout competitions where a winner is required various methods may be employed to break such a deadlock , some competitions may invoke replays . a game tied at the end of regulation time may go into extra time , which consists of two further 15-minute periods . if the score is still tied after extra time , some competitions allow the use of penalty shootouts ( known officially in the laws of the game as " kicks from the penalty mark " ) to determine which team will progress to the next stage of the tournament . goals scored during extra time periods count toward the final score of the game , but kicks from the penalty mark are only used to decide the team that progresses to the next part of the tournament ( with goals scored in a penalty shootout not making up part of the final score ) .
in babylonian astronomy , records of the motions of the stars , planets , and the moon are left on thousands of clay tablets created by scribes . even today , astronomical periods identified by mesopotamian proto-scientists are still widely used in western calendars such as the solar year and the lunar month . using these data they developed arithmetical methods to compute the changing length of daylight in the course of the year and to predict the appearances and disappearances of the moon and planets and eclipses of the sun and moon . only a few astronomers ' names are known , such as that of kidinnu , a chaldean astronomer and mathematician . kiddinu 's value for the solar year is in use for today 's calendars . babylonian astronomy was " the first and highly successful attempt at giving a refined mathematical description of astronomical phenomena . " according to the historian a. aaboe , " all subsequent varieties of scientific astronomy , in the hellenistic world , in india , in islam , and in the west - if not indeed all subsequent endeavour in the exact sciences - depend upon babylonian astronomy in decisive and fundamental ways . "
spanish was the language spoken by the first permanent european settlers in north america . spanish arrived in the territory of the modern united states with ponce de leon in 1513 . in 1565 , the spaniards , by way of juan ponce de leon , founded st. augustine , florida , and as of the early 1800s , it became the oldest continuously occupied european settlement in the continental united states . the oldest city in all of the u.s. territory , as of 1898 , is san juan , capital of puerto rico , where juan ponce de leon was its first governor
the martorana church ( decorated around 1143 ) looked originally even more byzantine although important parts were later demolished . the dome mosaic is similar to that of the cappella palatina , with christ enthroned in the middle and four bowed , elongated angels . the greek inscriptions , decorative patterns , and evangelists in the squinches are obviously executed by the same greek masters who worked on the cappella palatina . the mosaic depicting roger ii of sicily , dressed in byzantine imperial robes and receiving the crown by christ , was originally in the demolished narthex together with another panel , the theotokos with georgios of antiochia , the founder of the church .
capacitors made with any type of dielectric material will show some level of " dielectric absorption " or " soakage . " on discharging a capacitor and disconnecting it , after a short time it may develop a voltage due to hysteresis in the dielectric . this effect can be objectionable in applications such as precision sample and hold circuits or timing circuits . the level of absorption depends on many factors , from design considerations to charging time , since the absorption is a time-dependent process . however , the primary factor is the type of dielectric material . capacitors such as tantalum electrolytic or polysulfone film exhibit very high absorption , while polystyrene or teflon allow very small levels of absorption . in some capacitors where dangerous voltages and energies exist , such as in flashtubes , television sets , and defibrillators , the dielectric absorption can recharge the capacitor to hazardous voltages after it has been shorted or discharged . any capacitor containing over 10 joules of energy is generally considered hazardous , while 50 joules or higher is potentially lethal . a capacitor may regain anywhere from 0.01 to 20 % of its original charge over a period of several minutes , allowing a seemingly safe capacitor to become surprisingly dangerous .
architecture ( latin architectura , from the greek αρχιτεκτων arkhitekton " architect , " from αρχι- " chief " and τεκτων " builder " ) is both the process and the product of planning , designing , and constructing buildings and other physical structures . architectural works , in the material form of buildings , are often perceived as cultural symbols and as works of art . historical civilizations are often identified with their surviving architectural achievements .

insect ecology is the scientific study of how insects , individually or as a community , interact with the surrounding environment or ecosystem . : 3 insects play one of the most important roles in their ecosystems , which includes many roles , such as soil turning and aeration , dung burial , pest control , pollination and wildlife nutrition . an example is the beetles , which are scavengers that feed on dead animals and fallen trees and thereby recycle biological materials into forms found useful by other organisms . these insects , and others , are responsible for much of the process by which topsoil is created . : 3 , 218-228
polytechnics were granted university status under the further and higher education act 1992 . this meant that polytechnics could confer degrees without the oversight of the national cnaa organization . these institutions are sometimes referred to as post-1992 universities .
after the expulsion of the german population ethnic russians , belarusians , and ukrainians were settled in the northern part . in the soviet part of the region , a policy of eliminating all remnants of german history was pursued . all german place names were replaced by new russian names . the exclave was a military zone , which was closed to foreigners ; soviet citizens could only enter with special permission . in 1967 the remnants of konigsberg castle were demolished on the orders of leonid brezhnev to make way for a new " house of the soviets . "
after hms sheffield was wrecked by an argentinian attack , the sun was heavily criticised and even mocked for its coverage of the war in the daily mirror and the guardian , and the wider media queried the veracity of official information and worried about the number of casualties , the sun gave its response .

houston was founded in 1836 on land near the banks of buffalo bayou ( now known as allen 's landing ) and incorporated as a city on june 5 , 1837 . the city was named after former general sam houston , who was president of the republic of texas and had commanded and won at the battle of san jacinto 25 miles ( 40 km ) east of where the city was established . the burgeoning port and railroad industry , combined with oil discovery in 1901 , has induced continual surges in the city 's population . in the mid-twentieth century , houston became the home of the texas medical center - the world 's largest concentration of healthcare and research institutions - and nasa 's johnson space center , where the mission control center is located .
during world war ii , the british destroyed the major government buildings , oil wells and mines for tungsten , tin , lead and silver to keep them from the japanese . myanmar was bombed extensively by both sides . after independence , the country was in ruins with its major infrastructure completely destroyed . after a parliamentary government was formed in 1948 , prime minister u nu embarked upon a policy of nationalisation and the state was declared the owner of all land . the government also tried to implement a poorly considered eight-year plan . by the 1950s , rice exports had fallen by two thirds and mineral exports by over 96 % ( as compared to the pre-world war ii period ) . plans were partly financed by printing money , which led to inflation .
madonna 's music has been the subject of much analysis and scrutiny . robert m. grant , author of contemporary strategy analysis ( 2005 ) , commented that what has brought madonna success is " certainly not outstanding natural talent . as a vocalist , musician , dancer , songwriter , or actress , madonna 's talents seem modest . " he asserts madonna 's success is in relying on the talents of others , and that her personal relationships have served as cornerstones to the numerous reinventions in the longevity of her career . madonna 's approach was far from the music industry wisdom of " find a winning formula and stick to it . " her musical career has been a continuous experimentation with new musical ideas and new images and a constant quest for new heights of fame and acclaim . grant concluded that " having established herself as the queen of popular music , madonna did not stop there , but continued re-inventing . " musicologist susan mcclary wrote that " madonna 's art itself repeatedly deconstructs the traditional notion of the unified subject with finite ego boundaries . her pieces explore various ways of constituting identities that refuse stability , that remain fluid , that resist definition . "
the establishment of indian drugs and pharmaceuticals limited ( idpl ) , a public sector undertaking , in 1961 was followed over the decades by many national and global companies opening manufacturing and research facilities in the city . as of 2010 [ update ] , the city manufactured one third of india 's bulk drugs and 16 % of biotechnology products , contributing to its reputation as " india 's pharmaceutical capital " and the " genome valley of india . " hyderabad is a global centre of information technology , for which it is known as cyberabad ( cyber city ) . as of 2013 [ update ] , it contributed 15 % of india 's and 98 % of andhra pradesh 's exports in it and ites sectors and 22 % of nasscom 's total membership is from the city . the development of hitec city , a township with extensive technological infrastructure , prompted multinational companies to establish facilities in hyderabad . the city is home to more than 1300 it and ites firms , including global conglomerates such as microsoft ( operating its largest r & d campus outside the us ) , google , ibm , yahoo ! , dell , facebook , : 3 and major indian firms including tech mahindra , infosys , tata consultancy services ( tcs ) , polaris and wipro . : 3 in 2009 the world bank group ranked the city as the second best indian city for doing business . the city and its suburbs contain the highest number of special economic zones of any indian city .
longer works are often divided into self-contained pieces , called movements , often with contrasting characters or moods . for instance , symphonies written during the classical period are usually divided into four movements : ( 1 ) an opening allegro in sonata form , ( 2 ) a slow movement , ( 3 ) a minuet or scherzo , and ( 4 ) a final allegro . these movements can then be further broken down into a hierarchy of smaller units : first sections , then periods , and finally phrases .
wright himself believed that values > 0.25 represent very great genetic variation and that an fst of 0.15-0.25 represented great variation . however , about 5 % of human variation occurs between populations within continents , therefore fst values between continental groups of humans ( or races ) of as low as 0.1 ( or possibly lower ) have been found in some studies , suggesting more moderate levels of genetic variation . graves ( 1996 ) has countered that fst should not be used as a marker of subspecies status , as the statistic is used to measure the degree of differentiation between populations , although see also wright ( 1978 ) .
people of german origin are found in various places around the globe . united states is home to approximately 50 million german americans or one third of the german diaspora , making it the largest centre of german-descended people outside germany . brazil is the second largest with 5 million people claiming german ancestry . other significant centres are canada , argentina , south africa and france each accounting for at least 1 million . while the exact number of german-descended people is difficult to calculate , the available data makes it safe to claim the number is exceeding 100 million people .
reaction to the novel varied widely upon publication . literary analysis of it is sparse , considering the number of copies sold and its widespread use in education . author mary mcdonough murphy , who collected individual impressions of to kill a mockingbird by several authors and public figures , calls the book , " an astonishing phenomenon . " in 2006 , british librarians ranked the book ahead of the bible as one " every adult should read before they die . " it was adapted into an oscar-winning film in 1962 by director robert mulligan , with a screenplay by horton foote . since 1990 , a play based on the novel has been performed annually in harper lee 's hometown of monroeville , alabama .
saturated fats ( typically from animal sources ) have been a staple in many world cultures for millennia . unsaturated fats ( e. g . , vegetable oil ) are considered healthier , while trans fats are to be avoided . saturated and some trans fats are typically solid at room temperature ( such as butter or lard ) , while unsaturated fats are typically liquids ( such as olive oil or flaxseed oil ) . trans fats are very rare in nature , and have been shown to be highly detrimental to human health , but have properties useful in the food processing industry , such as rancidity resistance .

some critics express the opinion that it is only from the mid-19th century , and especially in the 20th century , that the score began to hold such a high significance . previously , improvisation ( in preludes , cadenzas and ornaments ) , rhythmic flexibility ( e.g. , tempo rubato ) , improvisatory deviation from the score and oral tradition of playing was integral to the style . yet in the 20th century , this oral tradition and passing on of stylistic features within classical music disappeared . instead , musicians tend to use just the score to play music . yet , even with the score providing the key elements of the music , there is considerable controversy about how to perform the works . some of this controversy relates to the fact that this score-centric approach has led to performances that emphasize metrically strict block-rhythms ( just as the music is notated in the score ) .
p. christiaan klieger , an anthropologist and scholar of the california academy of sciences in san francisco , writes that the vice royalty of the sakya regime installed by the mongols established a patron and priest relationship between tibetans and mongol converts to tibetan buddhism . according to him , the tibetan lamas and mongol khans upheld a " mutual role of religious prelate and secular patron , " respectively . he adds that " although agreements were made between tibetan leaders and mongol khans , ming and qing emperors , it was the republic of china and its communist successors that assumed the former imperial tributaries and subject states as integral parts of the chinese nation-state . "
the west balkan coast was inhabited by various illyrian tribes and kingdoms such as the kingdom of the dalmatae and of the ardiaei , who often engaged in piracy under queen teuta ( reigned 231 bc to 227 bce ) . further inland was the illyrian paeonian kingdom and the tribe of the agrianes which covers most of the modern republic of macedonia . illyrians on the coast of the adriatic were under the effects and influence of hellenisation and some tribes adopted greek , becoming bilingual due to their proximity to the greek colonies in illyria . illyrians imported weapons and armor from the ancient greeks ( such as the illyrian type helmet , originally a greek type ) and also adopted the ornamentation of ancient macedon on their shields and their war belts ( a single one has been found , dated 3rd century bc at modern selce e poshtme part of macedon at the time under philip v of macedon ) .
on 23 june 1757 , the english east india company defeated siraj-ud-daula , the nawab of bengal , in the battle of plassey . the british thus became masters of east india ( bengal , bihar , orissa ) - a prosperous region with a flourishing agriculture , industry and trade . this led to a large amount of children being forced into labour due to the increasing need of cheap labour to produce large numbers of goods . many multinationals often employed children because that they can be recruited for less pay , and have more endurance to utilise in factory environments . another reason many indian children were hired was because they lack knowledge of their basic rights , they did not cause trouble or complain , and they were often more trustworthy . the innocence that comes with childhood was utilised to make a profit by many and was encouraged by the need for family income .
as a boy , schwarzenegger played several sports , heavily influenced by his father . he picked up his first barbell in 1960 , when his soccer coach took his team to a local gym . at the age of 14 , he chose bodybuilding over soccer as a career . schwarzenegger has responded to a question asking if he was 13 when he started weightlifting : " i actually started weight training when i was 15 , but i 'd been participating in sports , like soccer , for years , so i felt that although i was slim , i was well-developed , at least enough so that i could start going to the gym and start olympic lifting . " however , his official website biography claims : " at 14 , he started an intensive training program with dan farmer , studied psychology at 15 ( to learn more about the power of mind over body ) and at 17 , officially started his competitive career . " during a speech in 2001 , he said , " my own plan formed when i was 14 years old . my father had wanted me to be a police officer like he was . my mother wanted me to go to trade school . " schwarzenegger took to visiting a gym in graz , where he also frequented the local movie theaters to see bodybuilding idols such as reg park , steve reeves , and johnny weissmuller on the big screen . when reeves died in 2000 , schwarzenegger fondly remembered him : " as a teenager , i grew up with steve reeves . his remarkable accomplishments allowed me a sense of what was possible , when others around me didn 't always understand my dreams . steve reeves has been part of everything i 've ever been fortunate enough to achieve . " in 1961 , schwarzenegger met former mr. austria kurt marnul , who invited him to train at the gym in graz . he was so dedicated as a youngster that he broke into the local gym on weekends , when it was usually closed , so that he could train . " it would make me sick to miss a workout ... i knew i couldn 't look at myself in the mirror the next morning if i didn 't do it . " when schwarzenegger was asked about his first movie experience as a boy , he replied : " i was very young , but i remember my father taking me to the austrian theaters and seeing some newsreels . the first real movie i saw , that i distinctly remember , was a john wayne movie . "
once the coastal assault had succeeded , eisenhower insisted on retaining personal control over the land battle strategy , and was immersed in the command and supply of multiple assaults through france on germany . field marshal montgomery insisted priority be given to his 21st army group 's attack being made in the north , while generals bradley ( 12th u.s. army group ) and devers ( sixth u.s. army group ) insisted they be given priority in the center and south of the front ( respectively ) . eisenhower worked tirelessly to address the demands of the rival commanders to optimize allied forces , often by giving them tactical , though sometimes ineffective , latitude ; many historians conclude this delayed the allied victory in europe . however , due to eisenhower 's persistence , the pivotal supply port at antwerp was successfully , albeit belatedly , opened in late 1944 , and victory became a more distinct probability .
stretching west from the blue ridge for approximately 55 miles ( 89 km ) is the ridge and valley region , in which numerous tributaries join to form the tennessee river in the tennessee valley . this area of tennessee is covered by fertile valleys separated by wooded ridges , such as bays mountain and clinch mountain . the western section of the tennessee valley , where the depressions become broader and the ridges become lower , is called the great valley . in this valley are numerous towns and two of the region 's three urban areas , knoxville , the 3rd largest city in the state , and chattanooga , the 4th largest city in the state . the third urban area , the tri-cities , comprising bristol , johnson city , and kingsport and their environs , is located to the northeast of knoxville .
agriculture is almost entirely dependent on angiosperms , which provide virtually all plant-based food , and also provide a significant amount of livestock feed . of all the families of plants , the poaceae , or grass family ( grains ) , is by far the most important , providing the bulk of all feedstocks ( rice , corn - maize , wheat , barley , rye , oats , pearl millet , sugar cane , sorghum ) . the fabaceae , or legume family , comes in second place . also of high importance are the solanaceae , or nightshade family ( potatoes , tomatoes , and peppers , among others ) , the cucurbitaceae , or gourd family ( also including pumpkins and melons ) , the brassicaceae , or mustard plant family ( including rapeseed and the innumerable varieties of the cabbage species brassica oleracea ) , and the apiaceae , or parsley family . many of our fruits come from the rutaceae , or rue family ( including oranges , lemons , grapefruits , etc . ) , and the rosaceae , or rose family ( including apples , pears , cherries , apricots , plums , etc . ) .
ipod batteries are not designed to be removed or replaced by the user , although some users have been able to open the case themselves , usually following instructions from third-party vendors of ipod replacement batteries . compounding the problem , apple initially would not replace worn-out batteries . the official policy was that the customer should buy a refurbished replacement ipod , at a cost almost equivalent to a brand new one . all lithium-ion batteries lose capacity during their lifetime even when not in use ( guidelines are available for prolonging life-span ) and this situation led to a market for third-party battery replacement kits .
beneath the plain lies the biscayne aquifer , a natural underground source of fresh water that extends from southern palm beach county to florida bay , with its highest point peaking around the cities of miami springs and hialeah . most of the miami metropolitan area obtains its drinking water from this aquifer . as a result of the aquifer , it is not possible to dig more than 15 to 20 ft ( 5 to 6 m ) beneath the city without hitting water , which impedes underground construction , though some underground parking garages exist . for this reason , the mass transit systems in and around miami are elevated or at-grade .

wieman 's words proved prophetic . though process and reality has been called " arguably the most impressive single metaphysical text of the twentieth century , " it has been little-read and little-understood , partly because it demands - as isabelle stengers puts it - " that its readers accept the adventure of the questions that will separate them from every consensus . " whitehead questioned western philosophy 's most dearly held assumptions about how the universe works , but in doing so he managed to anticipate a number of 21st century scientific and philosophical problems and provide novel solutions .
during the hundred years ' war a french attack ( 1340 ) burned a manor house and took some prisoners , but failed to get into the town . in 1403 the town was burned by breton raiders . in the late fifteenth century a ' castle quadrate ' was constructed close to the area now known as the barbican ; it included four round towers , one at each corner , as featured on the city coat of arms . the castle served to protect sutton pool , which is where the fleet was based in plymouth prior to the establishment of plymouth dockyard . in 1512 an act of parliament was passed for further fortifying plymouth , and a series of fortifications were then built , including defensive walls at the entrance to sutton pool ( across which a chain would be extended in time of danger ) . defences on st nicholas island also date from this time , and a string of six artillery blockhouses were built , including one on fishers nose at the south-eastern corner of the hoe . this location was further strengthened by the building of a fort ( later known as drake 's fort ) in 1596 , which itself went on to provide the site for the citadel , established in the 1660s ( see below ) .

this period also saw some contacts with jesuits and capuchins from europe , and in 1774 a scottish nobleman , george bogle , came to shigatse to investigate prospects of trade for the british east india company . however , in the 19th century the situation of foreigners in tibet grew more tenuous . the british empire was encroaching from northern india into the himalayas , the emirate of afghanistan and the russian empire were expanding into central asia and each power became suspicious of the others ' intentions in tibet .
according to archibald sayce , the primitive pictograms of the early sumerian ( i.e. uruk ) era suggest that " stone was scarce , but was already cut into blocks and seals . brick was the ordinary building material , and with it cities , forts , temples and houses were constructed . the city was provided with towers and stood on an artificial platform ; the house also had a tower-like appearance . it was provided with a door which turned on a hinge , and could be opened with a sort of key ; the city gate was on a larger scale , and seems to have been double . the foundation stones - or rather bricks - of a house were consecrated by certain objects that were deposited under them . "
most of the korean presbyterian denominations share the same name in korean , 대한예수교장로회 ( literally means the presbyterian church of korea or pck ) , tracing its roots to the united presbyterian assembly before its long history of disputes and schisms . the presbyterian schism began with the controversy in relation to the japanese shrine worship enforced during the japanese colonial period and the establishment of a minor division ( koryu-pa , 고려파 , later the koshin presbyterian church in korea , koshin 고신 ) in 1952 . and in 1953 the second schism happened when the theological orientation of the chosun seminary ( later hanshin university ) founded in 1947 could not be tolerated in the pck and another minor group ( the presbyterian church in the republic of korea , kijang , 기장 ) was separated . the last major schism had to do with the issue of whether the pck should join the wcc . the controversy divided the pck into two denominations , the presbyterian church of korea ( tonghap , 통합 ) and the general assembly of presbyterian church in korea ( hapdong , 합동 ) in 1959 . all major seminaries associated with each denomination claim heritage from the pyung yang theological seminary , therefore , not only presbyterian university and theological seminary and chongsin university which are related to pck but also hanshin university of prok all celebrated the 100th class in 2007 , 100 years from the first graduates of pyung yang theological seminary .

the english word slav could be derived from the middle english word sclave , which was borrowed from medieval latin sclavus or slavus , itself a borrowing and byzantine greek σκλαβος sklabos " slave , " which was in turn apparently derived from a misunderstanding of the slavic autonym ( denoting a speaker of their own languages ) . the byzantine term sklavinoi was loaned into arabic as saqaliba صقالبة ( sing . saqlabi صقلبي ) by medieval arab historiographers . however , the origin of this word is disputed .

the nationalist parties , in turn , demanded devolution to their respective constituent countries in return for their supporting the government . when referendums for scottish and welsh devolution were held in march 1979 welsh devolution was rejected outright while the scottish referendum returned a narrow majority in favour without reaching the required threshold of 40 % support . when the labour government duly refused to push ahead with setting up the proposed scottish assembly , the snp withdrew its support for the government : this finally brought the government down as it triggered a vote of confidence in callaghan 's government that was lost by a single vote on 28 march 1979 , necessitating a general election .
in late summer he was invited by jane stirling to visit scotland , where he stayed at calder house near edinburgh and at johnstone castle in renfrewshire , both owned by members of stirling 's family . she clearly had a notion of going beyond mere friendship , and chopin was obliged to make it clear to her that this could not be so . he wrote at this time to grzymała " my scottish ladies are kind , but such bores , " and responding to a rumour about his involvement , answered that he was " closer to the grave than the nuptial bed . " he gave a public concert in glasgow on 27 september , and another in edinburgh , at the hopetoun rooms on queen street ( now erskine house ) on 4 october . in late october 1848 , while staying at 10 warriston crescent in edinburgh with the polish physician adam łyszczynski , he wrote out his last will and testament - " a kind of disposition to be made of my stuff in the future , if i should drop dead somewhere , " he wrote to grzymała .
dvaita vedanta is a dualistic interpretation of the vedas , espouses dualism by theorizing the existence of two separate realities . the first and the only independent reality , states the dvaita school , is that of vishnu or brahman . vishnu is the supreme self , in a manner similar to monotheistic god in other major religions . the distinguishing factor of dvaita philosophy , as opposed to monistic advaita vedanta , is that god takes on a personal role and is seen as a real eternal entity that governs and controls the universe . like vishishtadvaita vedanta subschool , dvaita philosophy also embraced vaishnavism , with the metaphysical concept of brahman in the vedas identified with vishnu and the one and only supreme being . however , unlike vishishtadvaita which envisions ultimate qualified nondualism , the dualism of dvaita was permanent .
melbourne has an integrated public transport system based around extensive train , tram , bus and taxi systems . flinders street station was the world 's busiest passenger station in 1927 and melbourne 's tram network overtook sydney 's to become the world 's largest in the 1940s , at which time 25 % of travellers used public transport but by 2003 it had declined to just 7.6 % . the public transport system was privatised in 1999 , symbolising the peak of the decline . despite privatisation and successive governments persisting with auto-centric urban development into the 21st century , there have since been large increases in public transport patronage , with the mode share for commuters increasing to 14.8 % and 8.4 % of all trips . a target of 20 % public transport mode share for melbourne by 2020 was set by the state government in 2006 . since 2006 public transport patronage has grown by over 20 % .
the hellenistic period saw the rise of new comedy , the only few surviving representative texts being those of menander ( born 342 / 1 bce ) . only one play , dyskolos , survives in its entirety . the plots of this new hellenistic comedy of manners were more domestic and formulaic , stereotypical low born characters such as slaves became more important , the language was colloquial and major motifs included escapism , marriage , romance and luck ( tyche ) . though no hellenistic tragedy remains intact , they were still widely produced during the period , yet it seems that there was no major breakthrough in style , remaining within the classical model . the supplementum hellenisticum , a modern collection of extant fragments , contains the fragments of 150 authors .
the city has started moving away from the automobile and towards mass transit . from 2004 to 2009 , the annual number of unlinked public transportation trips increased by approximately 21 % . in 2006 , voters in king county passed proposition 2 ( transit now ) which increased bus service hours on high ridership routes and paid for five bus rapid transit lines called rapidride . after rejecting a roads and transit measure in 2007 , seattle-area voters passed a transit only measure in 2008 to increase st express bus service , extend the link light rail system , and expand and improve sounder commuter rail service . a light rail line from downtown heading south to sea-tac airport began service on december 19 , 2009 , giving the city its first rapid transit line with intermediate stations within the city limits . an extension north to the university of washington is scheduled to open in 2016 ; and further extensions are planned to reach lynnwood to the north , des moines to the south , and bellevue and redmond to the east by 2023 . former mayor michael mcginn has supported building light rail from downtown to ballard and west seattle .
the protestant movement began to diverge into several distinct branches in the mid-to-late 16th century . one of the central points of divergence was controversy over the eucharist . early protestants rejected the roman catholic dogma of transubstantiation , which teaches that the bread and wine used in the sacrificial rite of the mass lose their natural substance by being transformed into the body , blood , soul , and divinity of christ . they disagreed with one another concerning the presence of christ and his body and blood in holy communion .
buddhism began to spread throughout japan during the heian period , primarily through two major esoteric sects , tendai and shingon . tendai originated in china and is based on the lotus sutra , one of the most important sutras of mahayana buddhism ; saicho was key to its transmission to japan . shingon is the japanese transmission of the chinese chen yen school . shingon , brought to japan by the monk kukai , emphasizes esoteric buddhism . both kukai and saicho aimed to connect state and religion and establish support from the aristocracy , leading to the notion of ' aristocratic buddhism ' . an important element of tendai doctrine was the suggestion that enlightenment was accessible to " every creature . " saicho also sought independent ordination for tendai monks . a close relationship developed between the tendai monastery complex on mount hiei and the imperial court in its new capital at the foot of the mountain . as a result , tendai emphasized great reverence for the emperor and the nation . kammu himself was a notable patron of the otherworldly tendai sect , which rose to great power over the ensuing centuries . kukai greatly impressed the emperors who succeeded emperor kammu , and also generations of japanese , not only with his holiness but also with his poetry , calligraphy , painting , and sculpture . shingon , through its use of " rich symbols , rituals and mandalas " held a wide-ranging appeal .
the new haven green is the site of many free music concerts , especially during the summer months . these have included the new haven symphony orchestra , the july free concerts on the green in july , and the new haven jazz festival in august . the jazz festival , which began in 1982 , is one of the longest-running free outdoor festivals in the u.s. , until it was canceled for 2007 . headliners such as the breakfast , dave brubeck , ray charles and celia cruz have historically drawn 30,000 to 50,000 fans , filling up the new haven green to capacity . the new haven jazz festival was revived in 2008 and has been sponsored since by jazz haven .
the city is governed pursuant to the home rule charter of the city of detroit . the city government is run by a mayor and a nine-member city council and clerk elected on an at-large nonpartisan ballot . since voters approved the city 's charter in 1974 , detroit has had a " strong mayoral " system , with the mayor approving departmental appointments . the council approves budgets but the mayor is not obligated to adhere to any earmarking . city ordinances and substantially large contracts must be approved by the council . the detroit city code is the codification of detroit 's local ordinances .
in most parts of medieval europe , the upper class obtained the sole rights to hunt in certain areas of a feudal territory . game in these areas was used as a source of food and furs , often provided via professional huntsmen , but it was also expected to provide a form of recreation for the aristocracy . the importance of this proprietary view of game can be seen in the robin hood legends , in which one of the primary charges against the outlaws is that they " hunt the king 's deer . " in contrast , settlers in anglophone colonies gloried democratically in hunting for all .
jones comments that " chopin 's unique position as a composer , despite the fact that virtually everything he wrote was for the piano , has rarely been questioned . " he also notes that chopin was fortunate to arrive in paris in 1831 - " the artistic environment , the publishers who were willing to print his music , the wealthy and aristocratic who paid what chopin asked for their lessons " - and these factors , as well as his musical genius , also fuelled his contemporary and later reputation . while his illness and his love-affairs conform to some of the stereotypes of romanticism , the rarity of his public recitals ( as opposed to performances at fashionable paris soirees ) led arthur hutchings to suggest that " his lack of byronic flamboyance [ and ] his aristocratic reclusiveness make him exceptional " among his romantic contemporaries , such as liszt and henri herz .
by contrast , the habsburg frontier had settled somewhat , a stalemate caused by a stiffening of the habsburg defences . the long war against habsburg austria ( 1593-1606 ) created the need for greater numbers of ottoman infantry equipped with firearms , resulting in a relaxation of recruitment policy . this contributed to problems of indiscipline and outright rebelliousness within the corps , which were never fully solved . irregular sharpshooters ( sekban ) were also recruited , and on demobilization turned to brigandage in the jelali revolts ( 1595-1610 ) , which engendered widespread anarchy in anatolia in the late 16th and early 17th centuries . with the empire 's population reaching 30 million people by 1600 , the shortage of land placed further pressure on the government . in spite of these problems , the ottoman state remained strong , and its army did not collapse or suffer crushing defeats . the only exceptions were campaigns against the safavid dynasty of persia , where many of the ottoman eastern provinces were lost , some permanently . this 1603-1618 war eventually resulted in the treaty of nasuh pasha , which ceded the entire caucasus , except westernmost georgia , back into iranian safavid possession . campaigns during this era became increasingly inconclusive , even against weaker states with much smaller forces , such as poland or austria .
by the late middle ages , great britain was separated into the kingdoms of england and scotland . power in ireland fluxed between gaelic kingdoms , hiberno-norman lords and the english-dominated lordship of ireland . a similar situation existed in the principality of wales , which was slowly being annexed into the kingdom of england by a series of laws . during the course of the 15th century , the crown of england would assert a claim to the crown of france , thereby also releasing the king of england as from being vassal of the king of france . in 1534 , king henry viii , at first having been a strong defender of roman catholicism in the face of the reformation , separated from the roman church after failing to secure a divorce from the pope . his response was to place the king of england as " the only supreme head in earth of the church of england , " thereby removing the authority of the pope from the affairs of the english church . ireland , which had been held by the king of england as lord of ireland , but which strictly speaking had been a feudal possession of the pope since the norman invasion was declared a separate kingdom in personal union with england .
the simplest way to gain information about brain anatomy is by visual inspection , but many more sophisticated techniques have been developed . brain tissue in its natural state is too soft to work with , but it can be hardened by immersion in alcohol or other fixatives , and then sliced apart for examination of the interior . visually , the interior of the brain consists of areas of so-called grey matter , with a dark color , separated by areas of white matter , with a lighter color . further information can be gained by staining slices of brain tissue with a variety of chemicals that bring out areas where specific types of molecules are present in high concentrations . it is also possible to examine the microstructure of brain tissue using a microscope , and to trace the pattern of connections from one brain area to another .
the end result is that the resonant antenna will efficiently feed a signal into the transmission line only when the source signal 's frequency is close to that of the design frequency of the antenna , or one of the resonant multiples . this makes resonant antenna designs inherently narrowband , and they are most commonly used with a single target signal . they are particularly common on radar systems , where the same antenna is used for both broadcast and reception , or for radio and television broadcasts , where the antenna is working with a single frequency . they are less commonly used for reception where multiple channels are present , in which case additional modifications are used to increase the bandwidth , or entirely different antenna designs are used .
the country continued to be governed by a junta de salvacao nacional until the portuguese legislative election of 1976 . it was won by the portuguese socialist party ( ps ) and mario soares , its leader , became prime minister of the 1st constitutional government on 23 july . mario soares would be prime minister from 1976 to 1978 and again from 1983 to 1985 . in this capacity soares tried to resume the economic growth and development record that had been achieved before the carnation revolution , during the last decade of the previous regime . he initiated the process of accession to the european economic community ( eec ) by starting accession negotiations as early as 1977 .
in whitehead 's view , then , concepts such as " quality , " " matter , " and " form " are problematic . these " classical " concepts fail to adequately account for change , and overlook the active and experiential nature of the most basic elements of the world . they are useful abstractions , but are not the world 's basic building blocks . what is ordinarily conceived of as a single person , for instance , is philosophically described as a continuum of overlapping events . after all , people change all the time , if only because they have aged by another second and had some further experience . these occasions of experience are logically distinct , but are progressively connected in what whitehead calls a " society " of events . by assuming that enduring objects are the most real and fundamental things in the universe , materialists have mistaken the abstract for the concrete ( what whitehead calls the " fallacy of misplaced concreteness " ) .
imperial college boat clubthe imperial college boat club was founded on 12 december 1919 . the gold medal winning gb 8 + at the 2000 sydney olympics had been based at imperial college 's recently refurbished boathouse and included 3 alumni of the college along with their coach martin mcelroy . the club has been highly successful , with many wins at henley royal regatta including most recently in 2013 with victory in the prince albert challenge cup event . the club has been home to numerous national squad oarsmen and women and is open to all rowers not just students of imperial college london .
educational attainment : in 2000 , according to the u.s. census , out of the nearly 800,000 people in the bronx who were then at least 25 years old , 62.3 % had graduated from high school and 14.6 % held a bachelor 's or higher college degree . these percentages were lower than those for new york 's other boroughs , which ranged from 68.8 % ( brooklyn ) to 82.6 % ( staten island ) for high school graduates over 24 , and from 21.8 % ( brooklyn ) to 49.4 % ( manhattan ) for college graduates . ( the respective state and national percentages were [ ny ] 79.1 % & 27.4 % and [ us ] 80.4 % & 24.4 % . )
switzerland has a stable , prosperous and high-tech economy and enjoys great wealth , being ranked as the wealthiest country in the world per capita in multiple rankings . in 2011 it was ranked as the wealthiest country in the world in per capita terms ( with " wealth " being defined to include both financial and non-financial assets ) , while the 2013 credit suisse global wealth report showed that switzerland was the country with the highest average wealth per adult in 2013 . it has the world 's nineteenth largest economy by nominal gdp and the thirty-sixth largest by purchasing power parity . it is the twentieth largest exporter , despite its small size . switzerland has the highest european rating in the index of economic freedom 2010 , while also providing large coverage through public services . the nominal per capita gdp is higher than those of the larger western and central european economies and japan . if adjusted for purchasing power parity , switzerland ranks 8th in the world in terms of gdp per capita , according to the world bank and imf ( ranked 15th according to the cia worldfactbook ) .
the service 's b-2a aircraft entered service in the 1990s , its b-1b aircraft in the 1980s and its current b-52h aircraft in the early 1960s . the b-52 stratofortress airframe design is over 60 years old and the b-52h aircraft currently in the active inventory were all built between 1960 and 1962 . the b-52h is scheduled to remain in service for another 30 years , which would keep the airframe in service for nearly 90 years , an unprecedented length of service for any aircraft . the b-21 is projected to replace the b-52 and parts of the b-1b force by the mid-2020s .
there are technical limitations to archiving a web site , and as a consequence , it is possible for opposing parties in litigation to misuse the results provided by web site archives . this problem can be exacerbated by the practice of submitting screen shots of web pages in complaints , answers , or expert witness reports , when the underlying links are not exposed and therefore , can contain errors . for example , archives such as the wayback machine do not fill out forms and therefore , do not include the contents of non-restful e-commerce databases in their archives .
from the 17th through 19th centuries , the merging of folk beliefs about group differences with scientific explanations of those differences produced what one scholar has called an " ideology of race . " according to this ideology , races are primordial , natural , enduring and distinct . it was further argued that some groups may be the result of mixture between formerly distinct populations , but that careful study could distinguish the ancestral races that had combined to produce admixed groups . subsequent influential classifications by georges buffon , petrus camper and christoph meiners all classified " negros " as inferior to europeans . in the united states the racial theories of thomas jefferson were influential . he saw africans as inferior to whites especially in regards to their intellect , and imbued with unnatural sexual appetites , but described native americans as equals to whites .
solar distillation can be used to make saline or brackish water potable . the first recorded instance of this was by 16th-century arab alchemists . a large-scale solar distillation project was first constructed in 1872 in the chilean mining town of las salinas . the plant , which had solar collection area of 4,700 m2 ( 51,000 sq ft ) , could produce up to 22,700 l ( 5,000 imp gal ; 6,000 us gal ) per day and operate for 40 years . individual still designs include single-slope , double-slope ( or greenhouse type ) , vertical , conical , inverted absorber , multi-wick , and multiple effect . these stills can operate in passive , active , or hybrid modes . double-slope stills are the most economical for decentralized domestic purposes , while active multiple effect units are more suitable for large-scale applications .
uruguay 's 1830s were dominated by the confrontation between manuel oribe and fructuoso rivera , the two revolutionary leaders who had fought against the empire of brazil under the command of lavalleja , each of whom had become the caudillo of their respective faction . politics were divided between oribe 's blancos ( " whites " ) , represented by the national party , and rivera 's colorados ( " reds " ) , represented by the colorado party , with each party 's name taken from the colour of its emblems . in 1838 , oribe was forced to resign the presidency ; he established a rebel army and began a long civil war , the guerra grande , which lasted until 1851 .
other fortune 500 companies , while not headquartered in the area , do have a major presence . these include suntrust bank ( based in atlanta ) , capital one financial corporation ( officially based in mclean , virginia , but founded in richmond with its operations center and most employees in the richmond area ) , and the medical and pharmaceutical giant mckesson ( based in san francisco ) . capital one and altria company 's philip morris usa are two of the largest private richmond-area employers . dupont maintains a production facility in south richmond known as the spruance plant . ups freight , the less-than-truckload division of ups and formerly known as overnite transportation , has its corporate headquarters in richmond .
in 1963 , the robbins report on universities in the united kingdom concluded that such institutions should have four main " objectives essential to any properly balanced system : instruction in skills ; the promotion of the general powers of the mind so as to produce not mere specialists but rather cultivated men and women ; to maintain research in balance with teaching , since teaching should not be separated from the advancement of learning and the search for truth ; and to transmit a common culture and common standards of citizenship . "
falling prices also resulted in homes worth less than the mortgage loan , providing a financial incentive to enter foreclosure . the ongoing foreclosure epidemic that began in late 2006 in the u.s. continues to drain wealth from consumers and erodes the financial strength of banking institutions . defaults and losses on other loan types also increased significantly as the crisis expanded from the housing market to other parts of the economy . total losses are estimated in the trillions of u.s. dollars globally .
this season also saw the launch of the american idol songwriter contest which allows fans to vote for the " coronation song . " thousands of recordings of original songs were submitted by songwriters , and 20 entries selected for the public vote . the winning song , " this is my now , " was performed by both finalists during the finale and released by sparks on may 24 , 2007 .
a referendum was held in neighboring djibouti ( then known as french somaliland ) in 1958 , on the eve of somalia 's independence in 1960 , to decide whether or not to join the somali republic or to remain with france . the referendum turned out in favour of a continued association with france , largely due to a combined yes vote by the sizable afar ethnic group and resident europeans . there was also widespread vote rigging , with the french expelling thousands of somalis before the referendum reached the polls . the majority of those who voted no were somalis who were strongly in favour of joining a united somalia , as had been proposed by mahmoud harbi , vice president of the government council . harbi was killed in a plane crash two years later . djibouti finally gained its independence from france in 1977 , and hassan gouled aptidon , a somali who had campaigned for a yes vote in the referendum of 1958 , eventually wound up as djibouti 's first president ( 1977-1991 ) .
ruling elders are usually laymen ( and laywomen in some denominations ) who are elected by the congregation and ordained to serve with the teaching elders , assuming responsibility for nurture and leadership of the congregation . often , especially in larger congregations , the elders delegate the practicalities of buildings , finance , and temporal ministry to the needy in the congregation to a distinct group of officers ( sometimes called deacons , which are ordained in some denominations ) . this group may variously be known as a " deacon board , " " board of deacons " " diaconate , " or " deacons ' court . " these are sometimes known as " presbyters " to the full congregation .
the most common , and most purely linguistic , criterion is that of mutual intelligibility : two varieties are said to be dialects of the same language if being a speaker of one variety confers sufficient knowledge to understand and be understood by a speaker of the other ; otherwise , they are said to be different languages . however , this definition becomes problematic in the case of dialect continua , in which it may be the case that dialect b is mutually intelligible with both dialect a and dialect c but dialects a and c are not mutually intelligible with each other . in this case the criterion of mutual intelligibility makes it impossible to decide whether a and c are dialects of the same language or not . cases may also arise in which a speaker of dialect x can understand a speaker of dialect y , but not vice versa ; the mutual intelligibility criterion flounders here as well .
in march 1861 , victoria 's mother died , with victoria at her side . through reading her mother 's papers , victoria discovered that her mother had loved her deeply ; she was heart-broken , and blamed conroy and lehzen for " wickedly " estranging her from her mother . to relieve his wife during her intense and deep grief , albert took on most of her duties , despite being ill himself with chronic stomach trouble . in august , victoria and albert visited their son , the prince of wales , who was attending army manoeuvres near dublin , and spent a few days holidaying in killarney . in november , albert was made aware of gossip that his son had slept with an actress in ireland . appalled , albert travelled to cambridge , where his son was studying , to confront him . by the beginning of december , albert was very unwell . he was diagnosed with typhoid fever by william jenner , and died on 14 december 1861 . victoria was devastated . she blamed her husband 's death on worry over the prince of wales 's philandering . he had been " killed by that dreadful business , " she said . she entered a state of mourning and wore black for the remainder of her life . she avoided public appearances , and rarely set foot in london in the following years . her seclusion earned her the nickname " widow of windsor . "
southampton became a spa town in 1740 . it had also become a popular site for sea bathing by the 1760s , despite the lack of a good quality beach . innovative buildings specifically for this purpose were built at west quay , with baths that were filled and emptied by the flow of the tide .
the english word scientist is relatively recent - first coined by william whewell in the 19th century . previously , people investigating nature called themselves natural philosophers . while empirical investigations of the natural world have been described since classical antiquity ( for example , by thales , aristotle , and others ) , and scientific methods have been employed since the middle ages ( for example , by ibn al-haytham , and roger bacon ) , the dawn of modern science is often traced back to the early modern period and in particular to the scientific revolution that took place in 16th- and 17th-century europe . scientific methods are considered to be so fundamental to modern science that some consider earlier inquiries into nature to be pre-scientific . traditionally , historians of science have defined science sufficiently broadly to include those inquiries .
in cosmology and astronomy the phenomena of stars , nova , supernova , quasars and gamma-ray bursts are the universe 's highest-output energy transformations of matter . all stellar phenomena ( including solar activity ) are driven by various kinds of energy transformations . energy in such transformations is either from gravitational collapse of matter ( usually molecular hydrogen ) into various classes of astronomical objects ( stars , black holes , etc . ) , or from nuclear fusion ( of lighter elements , primarily hydrogen ) . the nuclear fusion of hydrogen in the sun also releases another store of potential energy which was created at the time of the big bang . at that time , according to theory , space expanded and the universe cooled too rapidly for hydrogen to completely fuse into heavier elements . this meant that hydrogen represents a store of potential energy that can be released by fusion . such a fusion process is triggered by heat and pressure generated from gravitational collapse of hydrogen clouds when they produce stars , and some of the fusion energy is then transformed into sunlight .
the dynasty was founded by the jurchen aisin gioro clan in manchuria . in the late sixteenth century , nurhaci , originally a ming vassal , began organizing jurchen clans into " banners , " military-social units . nurhaci formed these clans into a unified entity , the subjects of which became known collectively as the manchu people . by 1636 , his son hong taiji began driving ming forces out of liaodong and declared a new dynasty , the qing . in 1644 , peasant rebels led by li zicheng conquered the ming capital beijing . rather than serve them , ming general wu sangui made an alliance with the manchus and opened the shanhai pass to the banner armies led by prince dorgon , who defeated the rebels and seized beijing . the conquest of china proper was not completed until 1683 under the kangxi emperor ( r . 1661-1722 ) . the ten great campaigns of the qianlong emperor from the 1750s to the 1790s extended qing control into central asia . while the early rulers maintained their manchu ways , and while their official title was emperor they were known as khans to the mongols and patronized tibetan buddhism , they governed using confucian styles and institutions of bureaucratic government . they retained the imperial examinations to recruit han chinese to work under or in parallel with manchus . they also adapted the ideals of the tributary system in international relations , and in places such as taiwan , the qing so-called internal foreign policy closely resembled colonial policy and control .
the 25,000 cotton growers in the united states of america are heavily subsidized at the rate of $ 2 billion per year although china now provides the highest overall level of cotton sector support . the future of these subsidies is uncertain and has led to anticipatory expansion of cotton brokers ' operations in africa . dunavant expanded in africa by buying out local operations . this is only possible in former british colonies and mozambique ; former french colonies continue to maintain tight monopolies , inherited from their former colonialist masters , on cotton purchases at low fixed prices .
the isolation of enzymes from infected tissue can also provide the basis of a biochemical diagnosis of an infectious disease . for example , humans can make neither rna replicases nor reverse transcriptase , and the presence of these enzymes are characteristic of specific types of viral infections . the ability of the viral protein hemagglutinin to bind red blood cells together into a detectable matrix may also be characterized as a biochemical test for viral infection , although strictly speaking hemagglutinin is not an enzyme and has no metabolic function .
bal gangadhar tilak , an indian nationalist leader , declared swaraj as the destiny of the nation . his popular sentence " swaraj is my birthright , and i shall have it " became the source of inspiration for indians . tilak was backed by rising public leaders like bipin chandra pal and lala lajpat rai , who held the same point of view . under them , india 's three big provinces - maharashtra , bengal and punjab , india shaped the demand of the people and india 's nationalism . in 1907 , the congress was split into two factions : the radicals , led by tilak , advocated civil agitation and direct revolution to overthrow the british empire and the abandonment of all things british . the moderates , led by leaders like dadabhai naoroji and gopal krishna gokhale , on the other hand wanted reform within the framework of british rule .
unicode can be implemented by different character encodings . the most commonly used encodings are utf-8 , utf-16 and the now-obsolete ucs-2 . utf-8 uses one byte for any ascii character , all of which have the same code values in both utf-8 and ascii encoding , and up to four bytes for other characters . ucs-2 uses a 16-bit code unit ( two 8-bit bytes ) for each character but cannot encode every character in the current unicode standard . utf-16 extends ucs-2 , using one 16-bit unit for the characters that were representable in ucs-2 and two 16-bit units ( 4 × 8 bits ) to handle each of the additional characters .
before prince albert 's death , the palace was frequently the scene of musical entertainments , and the greatest contemporary musicians entertained at buckingham palace . the composer felix mendelssohn is known to have played there on three occasions . johann strauss ii and his orchestra played there when in england . strauss 's " alice polka " was first performed at the palace in 1849 in honour of the queen 's daughter , princess alice . under victoria , buckingham palace was frequently the scene of lavish costume balls , in addition to the usual royal ceremonies , investitures and presentations .
during world war i , the palace , then the home of king george v and queen mary , escaped unscathed . its more valuable contents were evacuated to windsor but the royal family remained in situ . the king imposed rationing at the palace , much to the dismay of his guests and household . to the king 's later regret , david lloyd george persuaded him to go further by ostentatiously locking the wine cellars and refraining from alcohol , to set a good example to the supposedly inebriated working class . the workers continued to imbibe and the king was left unhappy at his enforced abstinence . in 1938 , the north-west pavilion , designed by nash as a conservatory , was converted into a swimming pool .
in brazil , the minimum working age has been identified as fourteen due to continuous constitutional amendments that occurred in 1934 , 1937 , and 1946 . yet due to a change in the dictatorship by the military in the 80 's , the minimum age restriction was reduced to the age of twelve but was reviewed due to reports of dangerous and hazardous working conditions in 1988 . this led to the minimum age being raised once again to 14 . another set of restrictions was passed in 1998 that restricted the kinds of work youth could partake in , such as work that was considered hazardous like running construction equipment , or certain kinds of factory work . although many steps were taken to reduce the risk and occurrence of child labour , there is still a high number of children and adolescents working under the age of fourteen in brazil . it was not until recently in the 80 's that it was discovered that almost nine million children in brazil were working illegally and not partaking in traditional childhood activities that help to develop important life experiences .
in towns even most better-off people lived in terraced houses , which typically opened straight onto the street , often with a few steps up to the door . there was often an open space , protected by iron railings , dropping down to the basement level , with a discreet entrance down steps off the street for servants and deliveries ; this is known as the " area . " this meant that the ground floor front was now removed and protected from the street and encouraged the main reception rooms to move there from the floor above . where , as often , a new street or set of streets was developed , the road and pavements were raised up , and the gardens or yards behind the houses at a lower level , usually representing the original one .
with the redevelopment of las vegas and the opening of two casinos in connecticut in the early 1990s , along with newly built casinos in the nearby philadelphia metro area in the 2000s , atlantic city 's tourism began to decline due to its failure to diversify away from gaming . determined to expand , in 1999 the atlantic city redevelopment authority partnered with las vegas casino mogul steve wynn to develop a new roadway to a barren section of the city near the marina . nicknamed " the tunnel project , " steve wynn planned the proposed ' mirage atlantic city ' around the idea that he would connect the $ 330 million tunnel stretching 2.5 miles ( 4.0 km ) from the atlantic city expressway to his new resort . the roadway was later officially named the atlantic city-brigantine connector , and funnels incoming traffic off of the expressway into the city 's marina district and brigantine , new jersey .
prompted by the chaotic torch relays in western europe and north america , the president of the international olympic committee , jacques rogge described the situation as a " crisis " for the organization and stated that any athletes displaying tibetan flags at olympic venues could be expelled from the games. though he stopped short of cancelling the relay altogether despite calls to do so by some ioc members . the outcome of the relay influenced the ioc 's decision to scrap global relays in future editions of the games .
several mlb teams used to play regular exhibition games during the year against nearby teams in the other major league , but regular-season interleague play has made such games unnecessary . the two canadian mlb teams , the toronto blue jays of the american league and the montreal expos of the national league , met annually to play the pearson cup exhibition game ; this tradition ended when the expos moved to washington dc for the 2005 season . similarly , the new york yankees played in the mayor 's trophy game against various local rivals from 1946 to 1983 .
classical statistical mechanics requires the existence of h ( but does not define its value ) . eventually , following upon planck 's discovery , it was recognized that physical action cannot take on an arbitrary value . instead , it must be some multiple of a very small quantity , the " quantum of action , " now called the planck constant . classical physics cannot explain this fact . in many cases , such as for monochromatic light or for atoms , this quantum of action also implies that only certain energy levels are allowed , and values in between are forbidden .
aristotle of stagira , the most important disciple of plato , shared with his teacher the title of the greatest philosopher of antiquity . but while plato had sought to elucidate and explain things from the supra-sensual standpoint of the forms , his pupil preferred to start from the facts given us by experience . except from these three most significant greek philosophers other known schools of greek philosophy from other founders during ancient times were stoicism , epicureanism , skepticism and neoplatonism .
in 1958 , he became a boy scout and fulfilled a requirement for the photography merit badge by making a nine-minute 8 mm film entitled the last gunfight . years later , spielberg recalled to a magazine interviewer , " my dad 's still-camera was broken , so i asked the scoutmaster if i could tell a story with my father 's movie camera . he said yes , and i got an idea to do a western . i made it and got my merit badge . that was how it all started . " at age thirteen , while living in phoenix , spielberg won a prize for a 40-minute war film he titled escape to nowhere , using a cast composed of other high school friends . that motivated him to make 15 more amateur 8mm films . : 548 in 1963 , at age sixteen , spielberg wrote and directed his first independent film , a 140-minute science fiction adventure called firelight , which would later inspire close encounters . the film was made for $ 500 , most of which came from his father , and was shown in a local cinema for one evening , which earned back its cost .
nick fradiani won the season , defeating clark beckham . by winning , fradiani became the first winner from the northeast region . fradiani released " beautiful life " as his coronation single while beckham released " champion . " jax , the third place finalist , also released a single called " forcefield . "
shortness of breath occurs when the damage to the heart limits the output of the left ventricle , causing left ventricular failure and consequent pulmonary edema . other symptoms include diaphoresis ( an excessive form of sweating ) , weakness , light-headedness , nausea , vomiting , and palpitations . these symptoms are likely induced by a massive surge of catecholamines from the sympathetic nervous system , which occurs in response to pain and the blood flow abnormalities that result from dysfunction of the heart muscle . loss of consciousness ( due to inadequate blood flow to the brain and cardiogenic shock ) and sudden death ( frequently due to the development of ventricular fibrillation ) can occur in mis .
similar to the other eur-a countries , most portuguese die from noncommunicable diseases . mortality from cardiovascular diseases ( cvd ) is higher than in the eurozone , but its two main components , ischaemic heart disease and cerebrovascular disease , display inverse trends compared with the eur-a , with cerebrovascular disease being the single biggest killer in portugal ( 17 % ) . portuguese people die 12 % less often from cancer than in the eur-a , but mortality is not declining as rapidly as in the eur-a . cancer is more frequent among children as well as among women younger than 44 years . although lung cancer ( slowly increasing among women ) and breast cancer ( decreasing rapidly ) are scarcer , cancer of the cervix and the prostate are more frequent . portugal has the highest mortality rate for diabetes in the eur-a , with a sharp increase since the 1980s .
muammar gaddafi was born in a tent near qasr abu hadi , a rural area outside the town of sirte in the deserts of western libya . his family came from a small , relatively un-influential tribal group called the qadhadhfa , who were arabized berber in heritage . his father , mohammad abdul salam bin hamed bin mohammad , was known as abu meniar ( died 1985 ) , and his mother was named aisha ( died 1978 ) ; abu meniar earned a meager subsistence as a goat and camel herder . nomadic bedouins , they were illiterate and kept no birth records . as such , gaddafi 's date of birth is not known with certainty , and sources have set it in 1942 or in the spring of 1943 , although biographers blundy and lycett noted that it could have been pre-1940 . his parents ' only surviving son , he had three older sisters . gaddafi 's upbringing in bedouin culture influenced his personal tastes for the rest of his life . he repeatedly expressed a preference for the desert over the city and retreated to the desert to meditate .
some skyscraper buildings and other types of installation feature a destination operating panel where a passenger registers their floor calls before entering the car . the system lets them know which car to wait for , instead of everyone boarding the next car . in this way , travel time is reduced as the elevator makes fewer stops for individual passengers , and the computer distributes adjacent stops to different cars in the bank . although travel time is reduced , passenger waiting times may be longer as they will not necessarily be allocated the next car to depart . during the down peak period the benefit of destination control will be limited as passengers have a common destination .
the marriage of richard ii of england to anne of bohemia established contacts between the two nations and brought lollard ideas to her homeland . the teachings of the czech priest jan hus were based on those of john wycliffe , yet his followers , the hussites , were to have a much greater political impact than the lollards . hus gained a great following in bohemia , and in 1414 , he was requested to appear at the council of constance to defend his cause . when he was burned as a heretic in 1415 , it caused a popular uprising in the czech lands . the subsequent hussite wars fell apart due to internal quarrels and did not result in religious or national independence for the czechs , but both the catholic church and the german element within the country were weakened .
analysis of lighting quality particularly emphasizes use of natural lighting , but also considers spectral content if artificial light is to be used . not only will greater reliance on natural light reduce energy consumption , but will favorably impact human health and performance . new studies have shown that the performance of students is influenced by the time and duration of daylight in their regular schedules . designing school facilities to incorporate the right types of light at the right time of day for the right duration may improve student performance and well-being . similarly , designing lighting systems that maximize the right amount of light at the appropriate time of day for the elderly may help relieve symptoms of alzheimer 's disease . the human circadian system is entrained to a 24-hour light-dark pattern that mimics the earth 's natural light / dark pattern . when those patterns are disrupted , they disrupt the natural circadian cycle . circadian disruption may lead to numerous health problems including breast cancer , seasonal affective disorder , delayed sleep phase syndrome , and other ailments .
some organisms , such as the lichen trapelia involuta or microorganisms such as the bacterium citrobacter , can absorb concentrations of uranium that are up to 300 times the level of their environment . citrobacter species absorb uranyl ions when given glycerol phosphate ( or other similar organic phosphates ) . after one day , one gram of bacteria can encrust themselves with nine grams of uranyl phosphate crystals ; this creates the possibility that these organisms could be used in bioremediation to decontaminate uranium-polluted water . the proteobacterium geobacter has also been shown to bioremediate uranium in ground water . the mycorrhizal fungus glomus intraradices increases uranium content in the roots of its symbiotic plant .
american university economist george ayittey accused the arab government of sudan of practicing acts of racism against black citizens . according to ayittey , " in sudan ... the arabs monopolized power and excluded blacks - arab apartheid . " many african commentators joined ayittey in accusing sudan of practising arab apartheid .
dutch is one of the closest relatives of both german and english [ n 5 ] and is said to be roughly in between them . [ n 6 ] dutch , like english , has not undergone the high german consonant shift , does not use germanic umlaut as a grammatical marker , has largely abandoned the use of the subjunctive , and has levelled much of its morphology , including the case system . [ n 7 ] features shared with german include the survival of three grammatical genders - albeit with few grammatical consequences [ n 8 ] - as well as the use of modal particles , final-obstruent devoicing , and a similar word order . [ n 9 ] dutch vocabulary is mostly germanic and incorporates more romance loans than german but fewer than english . [ n 10 ]
although all these different shia tariqahs belong to the shia group ( as opposed to the sunni group ) in islam , there are major doctrinal differences between the main shia tariqahs . after that there is the complete doctrinal break between all the different shia tariqahs whose last imams have gone into occultation and the shia nizari ismailis who deny the very concept of occultation . the shia nizari ismailis by definition have to have a present and living imam until the end of time . [ citation needed ] thus if any living nizari ismaili imam fails to leave behind a successor after him then the nizari ismailism 's cardinal principle would be broken and it 's very raison d 'etre would come to an end .
in 1931 , rca victor launched the first commercially available vinyl long-playing record , marketed as program-transcription discs . these revolutionary discs were designed for playback at 33 1 ⁄ 3 rpm and pressed on a 30 cm diameter flexible plastic disc , with a duration of about ten minutes playing time per side . rca victor 's early introduction of a long-play disc was a commercial failure for several reasons including the lack of affordable , reliable consumer playback equipment and consumer wariness during the great depression . because of financial hardships that plagued the recording industry during that period ( and rca 's own parched revenues ) , victor 's long-playing records were discontinued by early 1933 .
the first code of canon law , 1917 , was mostly for the roman rite , with limited application to the eastern churches . after the second vatican council , ( 1962 - 1965 ) , another edition was published specifically for the roman rite in 1983 . most recently , 1990 , the vatican produced the code of canons of the eastern churches which became the 1st code of eastern catholic canon law .
about two thousand roman colonists were settled there in 138 bc during the rule of consul decimus junius brutus galaico . the roman historian florus says that brutus transferred the soldiers who had fought under him to that province . this was a typical roman city in its conception , as it was located in a strategic location near the sea on a river island crossed by the via augusta , the imperial road that connected the province to rome , the capital of the empire . the centre of the city was located in the present-day neighbourhood of the plaza de la virgen . here was the forum and the crossing of the cardo maximus and the decumanus maximus , which remain the two main axes of the city . the cardo corresponds to the existing calle de salvador , almoina , and the decumanus corresponds to calle de los caballeros .
historians have divided the history of cubism into phases . in one scheme , the first phase of cubism , known as analytic cubism , a phrase coined by juan gris a posteriori , was both radical and influential as a short but highly significant art movement between 1910 and 1912 in france . a second phase , synthetic cubism , remained vital until around 1919 , when the surrealist movement gained popularity . english art historian douglas cooper proposed another scheme , describing three phases of cubism in his book , the cubist epoch . according to cooper there was " early cubism , " ( from 1906 to 1908 ) when the movement was initially developed in the studios of picasso and braque ; the second phase being called " high cubism , " ( from 1909 to 1914 ) during which time juan gris emerged as an important exponent ( after 1911 ) ; and finally cooper referred to " late cubism " ( from 1914 to 1921 ) as the last phase of cubism as a radical avant-garde movement . douglas cooper 's restrictive use of these terms to distinguish the work of braque , picasso , gris ( from 1911 ) and leger ( to a lesser extent ) implied an intentional value judgement .
in the western balkans , south slavs and germanic gepids intermarried with avar invaders , eventually producing a slavicized population . [ citation needed ] in central europe , the slavs intermixed with germanic and celtic , while the eastern slavs encountered uralic and scandinavian peoples . scandinavians ( varangians ) and finnic peoples were involved in the early formation of the rus ' state but were completely slavicized after a century . some finno-ugric tribes in the north were also absorbed into the expanding rus population . at the time of the magyar migration , the present-day hungary was inhabited by slavs , numbering about 200,000 , and by romano-dacians who were either assimilated or enslaved by the magyars . in the 11th and 12th centuries , constant incursions by nomadic turkic tribes , such as the kipchaks and the pechenegs , caused a massive migration of east slavic populations to the safer , heavily forested regions of the north . in the middle ages , groups of saxon ore miners settled in medieval bosnia , serbia and bulgaria where they were slavicized .
the first telephone lines were installed in 1882 and electric street lights took the place of the gas operated ones in 1886 . the hipodromo de maronas started operating in 1888 , and the neighbourhoods of reus del sur , reus del norte and conciliacion were inaugurated in 1889 . the new building of the school of arts and trades , as well as zabala square in ciudad vieja were inaugurated in 1890 , followed by the italian hospital in 1891 . in the same year , the village of penarol was founded . other neighbourhoods that were founded were belgrano and belvedere in 1892 , jacinto vera in 1895 and trouville in 1897 . in 1894 the new port was constructed , and in 1897 , the central railway station of montevideo was inaugurated .
van praag states that the ming court established diplomatic delegations with tibet merely to secure urgently needed horses . wang and nyima argue that these were not diplomatic delegations at all , that tibetan areas were ruled by the ming since tibetan leaders were granted positions as ming officials , that horses were collected from tibet as a mandatory " corvee " tax , and therefore tibetans were " undertaking domestic affairs , not foreign diplomacy . " sperling writes that the ming simultaneously bought horses in the kham region while fighting tibetan tribes in amdo and receiving tibetan embassies in nanjing . he also argues that the embassies of tibetan lamas visiting the ming court were for the most part efforts to promote commercial transactions between the lamas ' large , wealthy entourage and ming chinese merchants and officials . kolmas writes that while the ming maintained a laissez-faire policy towards tibet and limited the numbers of the tibetan retinues , the tibetans sought to maintain a tributary relationship with the ming because imperial patronage provided them with wealth and power . laird writes that tibetans eagerly sought ming court invitations since the gifts the tibetans received for bringing tribute were much greater in value than the latter . as for the yongle emperor 's gifts to his tibetan and nepalese vassals such as silver wares , buddha relics , utensils for buddhist temples and religious ceremonies , and gowns and robes for monks , tsai writes " in his effort to draw neighboring states to the ming orbit so that he could bask in glory , the yongle emperor was quite willing to pay a small price . " the information office of the state council of the prc lists the tibetan tribute items as oxen , horses , camels , sheep , fur products , medical herbs , tibetan incenses , thangkas ( painted scrolls ) , and handicrafts ; while the ming awarded tibetan tribute-bearers an equal value of gold , silver , satin and brocade , bolts of cloth , grains , and tea leaves . silk workshops during the ming also catered specifically to the tibetan market with silk clothes and furnishings featuring tibetan buddhist iconography .
melbourne 's air quality is generally good and has improved significantly since the 1980s . like many urban environments , the city faces significant environmental issues , many of them relating to the city 's large urban footprint and urban sprawl and the demand for infrastructure and services . one such issue is water usage , drought and low rainfall . drought in victoria , low rainfalls and high temperatures deplete melbourne water supplies and climate change may have a long-term impact on the water supplies of melbourne . in response to low water supplies and low rainfall due to drought , the government implemented water restrictions and a range of other options including : water recycling schemes for the city , incentives for household water tanks , greywater systems , water consumption awareness initiatives , and other water saving and reuse initiatives ; also , in june 2007 , the bracks government announced that a $ 3.1 billion wonthaggi desalination plant would be built on victoria 's south-east coast , capable of treating 150 billion litres of water per year , as well as a 70 km ( 43 mi ) pipeline from the goulburn area in victoria 's north to melbourne and a new water pipeline linking melbourne and geelong . both projects are being conducted under controversial public-private partnerships and a multitude of independent reports have found that neither project is required to supply water to the city and that sustainable water management is the best solution . in the meantime , the drought must be weathered .
the isolation of enzymes from infected tissue can also provide the basis of a biochemical diagnosis of an infectious disease . for example , humans can make neither rna replicases nor reverse transcriptase , and the presence of these enzymes are characteristic of specific types of viral infections . the ability of the viral protein hemagglutinin to bind red blood cells together into a detectable matrix may also be characterized as a biochemical test for viral infection , although strictly speaking hemagglutinin is not an enzyme and has no metabolic function .
in july 1956 , nasser unilaterally nationalised the suez canal . the response of anthony eden , who had succeeded churchill as prime minister , was to collude with france to engineer an israeli attack on egypt that would give britain and france an excuse to intervene militarily and retake the canal . eden infuriated us president dwight d. eisenhower , by his lack of consultation , and eisenhower refused to back the invasion . another of eisenhower 's concerns was the possibility of a wider war with the soviet union after it threatened to intervene on the egyptian side . eisenhower applied financial leverage by threatening to sell us reserves of the british pound and thereby precipitate a collapse of the british currency . though the invasion force was militarily successful in its objectives , un intervention and us pressure forced britain into a humiliating withdrawal of its forces , and eden resigned .
the question of priority for the variable resistance feature of the telephone was raised by the examiner before he approved bell 's patent application . he told bell that his claim for the variable resistance feature was also described in gray 's caveat . bell pointed to a variable resistance device in bell 's previous application in which bell described a cup of mercury , not water . bell had filed the mercury application at the patent office a year earlier on february 25 , 1875 , long before elisha gray described the water device . in addition , gray abandoned his caveat , and because he did not contest bell 's priority , the examiner approved bell 's patent on march 3 , 1876 . gray had reinvented the variable resistance telephone , but bell was the first to write down the idea and the first to test it in a telephone .
professional wrestling shows can be considered a form of theatre in the round , with the ring , ringside area , and entryway comprising a thrust stage . however , there is a much more limited concept of a fourth wall than in most theatric performances . the audience is recognized and acknowledged by the performers as spectators to the sporting event being portrayed , and are encouraged to interact as such . this leads to a high level of audience participation ; in fact , their reactions can dictate how the performance unfolds . often , individual matches will be part of a longer storyline conflict between " babyfaces " ( often shortened to just " faces " ) and " heels . " " faces " ( the " good guys " ) are those whose actions are intended to encourage the audience to cheer , while " heels " ( the " bad guys " ) act to draw the spectators ' ire .
on 1 july 1967 , bbc two became the first television channel in europe to broadcast regularly in colour , using the west german pal system that is still in use today although being gradually superseded by digital systems . ( bbc one and itv began 625-line colour broadcasts simultaneously on 15 november 1969 ) . unlike other terrestrial channels , bbc two does not have soap opera or standard news programming , but a range of programmes intended to be eclectic and diverse ( although if a programme has high audience ratings it is often eventually repositioned to bbc one ) . the different remit of bbc2 allowed its first controller , sir david attenborough to commission the first heavyweight documentaries and documentary series such as civilisation , the ascent of man and horizon .
carnival in haiti started in 1804 in the capital port-au-prince after the declaration of independence . the port-au-prince carnival is one of the largest in north america . it is known as kanaval in the creole language . it starts in january , known as " pre-kanaval , " while the main carnival activities begin in february . in july 2012 , haiti had another carnival called kanaval de fleur . beautiful costumes , floats , rara parades , masks , foods , and popular rasin music ( like boukman eksperyans , foula vodoule , tokay , boukan ginen , eritaj , etc . ) and kompa bands ( such as t-vice , djakout no. 1 , sweet micky , kreyol la , d.p. express , mizik mizik , ram , t-micky , carimi , djakout mizik , and scorpio fever ) play for dancers in the streets of the plaza of champ-de-mars . an annual song competition takes place .
the findings and insights of speech perception and articulation research complicate the traditional and somewhat intuitive idea of interchangeable allophones being perceived as the same phoneme . first , interchanged allophones of the same phoneme can result in unrecognizable words . second , actual speech , even at a word level , is highly co-articulated , so it is problematic to expect to be able to splice words into simple segments without affecting speech perception .
the city grew out towards the west of the boundaries of the peninsula formed by the river aare . the zytglogge tower marked the western boundary of the city from 1191 until 1256 , when the kafigturm took over this role until 1345 . it was , in turn , succeeded by the christoffelturm ( formerly located close to the site of the modern-day railway station ) until 1622 . during the time of the thirty years ' war , two new fortifications - the so-called big and small schanze ( entrenchment ) - were built to protect the whole area of the peninsula .
although most of the simplified chinese characters in use today are the result of the works moderated by the government of the people 's republic of china in the 1950s and 60s , character simplification predates the republic 's formation in 1949 . one of the earliest proponents of character simplification was lufei kui , who proposed in 1909 that simplified characters should be used in education . in the years following the may fourth movement in 1919 , many anti-imperialist chinese intellectuals sought ways to modernise china . in the 1930s and 1940s , discussions on character simplification took place within the kuomintang government , and many chinese intellectuals and writers have long maintained that character simplification would help boost literacy in china . in many world languages , literacy has been promoted as a justification for spelling reforms . the people 's republic of china issued its first round of official character simplifications in two documents , the first in 1956 and the second in 1964 . in the 1950s and 1960s , while confusion about simplified characters was still rampant , transitional characters that mixed simplified parts with yet-to-be simplified parts of characters together appeared briefly , then disappeared .
various ecumenical movements have attempted cooperation or reorganization of the various divided protestant denominations , according to various models of union , but divisions continue to outpace unions , as there is no overarching authority to which any of the churches owe allegiance , which can authoritatively define the faith . most denominations share common beliefs in the major aspects of the christian faith while differing in many secondary doctrines , although what is major and what is secondary is a matter of idiosyncratic belief .
the company , which benefited from the imperial patronage , soon expanded its commercial trading operations , eclipsing the portuguese estado da india , which had established bases in goa , chittagong , and bombay , which portugal later ceded to england as part of the dowry of catherine de braganza . the east india company also launched a joint attack with the dutch united east india company on portuguese and spanish ships off the coast of china , which helped secure their ports in china . the company established trading posts in surat ( 1619 ) , madras ( 1639 ) , bombay ( 1668 ) , and calcutta ( 1690 ) . by 1647 , the company had 23 factories , each under the command of a factor or master merchant and governor if so chosen , and 90 employees in india . the major factories became the walled forts of fort william in bengal , fort st george in madras , and bombay castle .
japan conscripted many soldiers from its colonies of korea and formosa ( taiwan ) . to a small extent , some vichy french , indian national army , and burmese national army forces were active in the area of the pacific war . collaborationist units from hong kong ( reformed ex-colonial police ) , philippines , dutch east indies ( the peta ) and dutch guinea , british malaya and british borneo , inner mongolia and former french indochina ( after the overthrow of vichy french regime ) as well as timorese militia also assisted japanese war efforts .
according to mtdna studies by holden ( 2005 ) and richards et al . ( 2006 ) , a significant proportion of the maternal lineages of somalis consists of the m1 haplogroup . this mitochondrial clade is common among ethiopians and north africans , particularly egyptians and algerians . m1 is believed to have originated in asia , where its parent m clade represents the majority of mtdna lineages . this haplogroup is also thought to possibly correlate with the afro-asiatic language family :
after hurricane katrina in 2005 , beyonce and rowland founded the survivor foundation to provide transitional housing for victims in the houston area , to which beyonce contributed an initial $ 250,000 . the foundation has since expanded to work with other charities in the city , and also provided relief following hurricane ike three years later .
application of the term " indian " originated with christopher columbus , who , in his search for asia , thought that he had arrived in the east indies . the americas came to be known as the " west indies , " a name still used to refer to the islands of the caribbean sea . this led to the names " indies " and " indian , " which implied some kind of racial or cultural unity among the aboriginal peoples of the americas . this unifying concept , codified in law , religion , and politics , was not originally accepted by indigenous peoples but has been embraced by many over the last two centuries . [ citation needed ] even though the term " indian " does not include the aleuts , inuit , or yupik peoples , these groups are considered indigenous peoples of the americas .
in contrast to catholic allegations of rationalism and naturalism , protestant objections are more likely to be based on allegations of mysticism , occultism , and even satanism . masonic scholar albert pike is often quoted ( in some cases misquoted ) by protestant anti-masons as an authority for the position of masonry on these issues . however , pike , although undoubtedly learned , was not a spokesman for freemasonry and was also controversial among freemasons in general . his writings represented his personal opinion only , and furthermore an opinion grounded in the attitudes and understandings of late 19th century southern freemasonry of the usa . notably , his book carries in the preface a form of disclaimer from his own grand lodge . no one voice has ever spoken for the whole of freemasonry .
in the late 19th century , after the berlin conference had ended , european empires sailed with their armies to the horn of africa . the imperial clouds wavering over somalia alarmed the dervish leader mohammed abdullah hassan , who gathered somali soldiers from across the horn of africa and began one of the longest anti-colonial wars ever . the dervish state successfully repulsed the british empire four times and forced it to retreat to the coastal region . as a result of its successes against the british , the dervish state received support from the ottoman and german empires . the turks also named hassan emir of the somali nation , and the germans promised to officially recognize any territories the dervishes were to acquire . after a quarter of a century of holding the british at bay , the dervishes were finally defeated in 1920 , when britain for the first time in africa used airplanes to bomb the dervish capital of taleex . as a result of this bombardment , former dervish territories were turned into a protectorate of britain . italy similarly faced the same opposition from somali sultans and armies and did not acquire full control of parts of modern somalia until the fascist era in late 1927 . this occupation lasted till 1941 and was replaced by a british military administration .
hegel certainly intends to preserve what he takes to be true of german idealism , in particular kant 's insistence that ethical reason can and does go beyond finite inclinations . for hegel there must be some identity of thought and being for the " subject " ( any human observer ) ) to be able to know any observed " object " ( any external entity , possibly even another human ) at all . under hegel 's concept of " subject-object identity , " subject and object both have spirit ( hegel 's ersatz , redefined , nonsupernatural " god " ) as their conceptual ( not metaphysical ) inner reality - and in that sense are identical . but until spirit 's " self-realization " occurs and spirit graduates from spirit to absolute spirit status , subject ( a human mind ) mistakenly thinks every " object " it observes is something " alien , " meaning something separate or apart from " subject . " in hegel 's words , " the object is revealed to it [ to " subject " ] by [ as ] something alien , and it does not recognize itself . " self-realization occurs when hegel ( part of spirit 's nonsupernatural mind , which is the collective mind of all humans ) arrives on the scene and realizes that every " object " is himself , because both subject and object are essentially spirit . when self-realization occurs and spirit becomes absolute spirit , the " finite " ( man , human ) becomes the " infinite " ( " god , " divine ) , replacing the imaginary or " picture-thinking " supernatural god of theism : man becomes god . tucker puts it this way : " hegelianism . . . is a religion of self-worship whose fundamental theme is given in hegel 's image of the man who aspires to be god himself , who demands ' something more , namely infinity . ' " the picture hegel presents is " a picture of a self-glorifying humanity striving compulsively , and at the end successfully , to rise to divinity . "
the national archives building in downtown washington holds record collections such as all existing federal census records , ships ' passenger lists , military unit records from the american revolution to the philippine-american war , records of the confederate government , the freedmen 's bureau records , and pension and land records .
based on the strength of his work , universal signed spielberg to do four tv films . the first was a richard matheson adaptation called duel . the film is about a psychotic peterbilt 281 tanker truck driver who chases the terrified driver ( dennis weaver ) of a small plymouth valiant and tries to run him off the road . special praise of this film by the influential british critic dilys powell was highly significant to spielberg 's career . another tv film ( something evil ) was made and released to capitalize on the popularity of the exorcist , then a major best-selling book which had not yet been released as a film . he fulfilled his contract by directing the tv film-length pilot of a show called savage , starring martin landau . spielberg 's debut full-length feature film was the sugarland express , about a married couple who are chased by police as the couple tries to regain custody of their baby . spielberg 's cinematography for the police chase was praised by reviewers , and the hollywood reporter stated that " a major new director is on the horizon . " : 223 however , the film fared poorly at the box office and received a limited release .
while the concordat restored much power to the papacy , the balance of church-state relations had tilted firmly in napoleon 's favour . he selected the bishops and supervised church finances . napoleon and the pope both found the concordat useful . similar arrangements were made with the church in territories controlled by napoleon , especially italy and germany . now , napoleon could win favor with the catholics while also controlling rome in a political sense . napoleon said in april 1801 , " skillful conquerors have not got entangled with priests . they can both contain them and use them . " french children were issued a catechism that taught them to love and respect napoleon .
medieval writers divided history into periods such as the " six ages " or the " four empires , " and considered their time to be the last before the end of the world . when referring to their own times , they spoke of them as being " modern . " in the 1330s , the humanist and poet petrarch referred to pre-christian times as antiqua ( or " ancient " ) and to the christian period as nova ( or " new " ) . leonardo bruni was the first historian to use tripartite periodisation in his history of the florentine people ( 1442 ) . bruni and later historians argued that italy had recovered since petrarch 's time , and therefore added a third period to petrarch 's two . the " middle ages " first appears in latin in 1469 as media tempestas or " middle season . " in early usage , there were many variants , including medium aevum , or " middle age , " first recorded in 1604 , and media saecula , or " middle ages , " first recorded in 1625 . the alternative term " medieval " ( or occasionally " mediaeval " ) derives from medium aevum . tripartite periodisation became standard after the german 17th century historian christoph cellarius divided history into three periods : ancient , medieval , and modern .
in 1970 , the new haven black panther trials took place , the largest and longest trials in connecticut history . black panther party co-founder bobby seale and ten other party members were tried for murdering an alleged informant . beginning on may day , the city became a center of protest for 12,000 panther supporters , college students , and new left activists ( including jean genet , benjamin spock , abbie hoffman , jerry rubin , and john froines ) , who amassed on the new haven green , across the street from where the trials were being held . violent confrontations between the demonstrators and the new haven police occurred , and several bombs were set off in the area by radicals . the event became a rallying point for the new left and critics of the nixon administration .
on october 1 , 1989 , a peaceful demonstration of 10,000 to 15,000 people was violently dispersed by the militia in front of lviv 's druzhba stadium , where a concert celebrating the soviet " reunification " of ukrainian lands was being held . on october 10 , ivano-frankivsk was the site of a pre-election protest attended by 30,000 people . on october 15 , several thousand people gathered in chervonohrad , chernivtsi , rivne , and zhytomyr ; 500 in dnipropetrovsk ; and 30,000 in lviv to protest the election law . on october 20 , faithful and clergy of the ukrainian autocephalous orthodox church participated in a synod in lviv , the first since its forced liquidation in the 1930s .
the baker v. carr ( 1962 ) decision of the us supreme court established the principle of " one man , one vote , " requiring state legislatures to redistrict to bring congressional apportionment in line with decennial censuses . it also required both houses of state legislatures to be based on population for representation and not geographic districts such as counties . this case arose out of a lawsuit challenging the longstanding rural bias of apportionment of seats in the tennessee legislature . after decades in which urban populations had been underrepresented in many state legislatures , this significant ruling led to an increased ( and proportional ) prominence in state politics by urban and , eventually , suburban , legislators and statewide officeholders in relation to their population within the state . the ruling also applied to numerous other states long controlled by rural minorities , such as alabama , vermont , and montana .
pharmaceutical fraud involves deceptions which bring financial gain to a pharmaceutical company . it affects individuals and public and private insurers . there are several different schemes used to defraud the health care system which are particular to the pharmaceutical industry . these include : good manufacturing practice ( gmp ) violations , off label marketing , best price fraud , cme fraud , medicaid price reporting , and manufactured compound drugs . of this amount $ 2.5 billion was recovered through false claims act cases in fy 2010 . examples of fraud cases include the glaxosmithkline $ 3 billion settlement , pfizer $ 2.3 billion settlement and merck & co . $ 650 million settlement . damages from fraud can be recovered by use of the false claims act , most commonly under the qui tam provisions which rewards an individual for being a " whistleblower , " or relator ( law ) .
walter bradford cannon agreed that physiological responses played a crucial role in emotions , but did not believe that physiological responses alone could explain subjective emotional experiences . he argued that physiological responses were too slow and often imperceptible and this could not account for the relatively rapid and intense subjective awareness of emotion . he also believed that the richness , variety , and temporal course of emotional experiences could not stem from physiological reactions , that reflected fairly undifferentiated fight or flight responses . an example of this theory in action is as follows : an emotion-evoking event ( snake ) triggers simultaneously both a physiological response and a conscious experience of an emotion .
various methods have been used in the history of the american colonies and the united states but only five methods are currently used . historically , burning , crushing , breaking on wheel , and bludgeoning were used for a small number of executions , while hanging was the most common method . the last person burned at the stake was a black slave in south carolina in august 1825 . the last person to be hanged in chains was a murderer named john marshall in west virginia on april 4 , 1913 . although beheading was a legal method in utah from 1851 to 1888 , it was never used .
the city 's fm radio band features rte radio 1 , rte 2fm , rte lyric fm , rte raidio na gaeltachta , today fm , 4fm , newstalk and the religious station spirit radio . there are also local stations such as cork 's 96fm , cork 's red fm , c103 , cuh 102.0fm , ucc 98.3fm ( formerly cork campus radio 97.4fm ) and christian radio station life 93.1fm. cork also has a temporary licensed city-wide community station ' cork fm community radio ' on 100.5fm , which is currently on-air on saturdays and sundays only . cork has also been home to pirate radio stations , including south coast radio and eri in the 1980s . today some small pirates stations remain . a number of neighbouring counties radio stations can be heard in parts of cork city including radio kerry at 97.0 and wlr fm on 95.1 .
some critics believe that a clear-text edition gives the edited text too great a prominence , relegating textual variants to appendices that are difficult to use , and suggesting a greater sense of certainty about the established text than it deserves . as shillingsburg notes , " english scholarly editions have tended to use notes at the foot of the text page , indicating , tacitly , a greater modesty about the " established " text and drawing attention more forcibly to at least some of the alternative forms of the text . "
genes are regulated so that they are expressed only when the product is needed , since expression draws on limited resources . : 7 a cell regulates its gene expression depending on its external environment ( e.g. available nutrients , temperature and other stresses ) , its internal environment ( e.g. cell division cycle , metabolism , infection status ) , and its specific role if in a multicellular organism . gene expression can be regulated at any step : from transcriptional initiation , to rna processing , to post-translational modification of the protein . the regulation of lactose metabolism genes in e. coli ( lac operon ) was the first such mechanism to be described in 1961 .
likewise the migration of spanish-speaking nicaraguans also began as a result of political instability during the end of the 1970s and the 1980s . the uprising of the sandinista revolution which toppled the somoza dictatorship in 1979 caused many nicaraguans to migrate particularly from those opposing the sandinistas . throughout the 1980s with the united states supported contra war ( or contra-revolutionary war ) which continued up until 1988 , and the economic collapse of the country many more nicaraguans migrated to the united states amongst other countries . the states of the united states where most nicaraguans migrated to include florida , california and texas .
some species of marine animals exist and rely , directly or indirectly , on the phytoplankton . antarctic sea life includes penguins , blue whales , orcas , colossal squids and fur seals . the emperor penguin is the only penguin that breeds during the winter in antarctica , while the adelie penguin breeds farther south than any other penguin . the rockhopper penguin has distinctive feathers around the eyes , giving the appearance of elaborate eyelashes . king penguins , chinstrap penguins , and gentoo penguins also breed in the antarctic .
in the us , nutritional standards and recommendations are established jointly by the us department of agriculture and us department of health and human services . dietary and physical activity guidelines from the usda are presented in the concept of myplate , which superseded the food pyramid , which replaced the four food groups . the senate committee currently responsible for oversight of the usda is the agriculture , nutrition and forestry committee . committee hearings are often televised on c-span .
the first legal steps taken to end the occurrence of child labour was enacted more than fifty years ago . in 1966 , the nation adopted the un general assembly of the international covenant on economic , social and cultural rights . this act legally limited the minimum age for when children could start work at the age of 14 . but 23 years later in 1989 the convention on the rights of children was adopted and helped to reduce the exploitation of children and demanded safe working environments . they all worked towards the goal of ending the most problematic forms of child labour .
fossilized spores suggest that higher plants ( embryophytes ) have lived on land for at least 475 million years . early land plants reproduced sexually with flagellated , swimming sperm , like the green algae from which they evolved . an adaptation to terrestrialization was the development of upright meiosporangia for dispersal by spores to new habitats . this feature is lacking in the descendants of their nearest algal relatives , the charophycean green algae . a later terrestrial adaptation took place with retention of the delicate , avascular sexual stage , the gametophyte , within the tissues of the vascular sporophyte . this occurred by spore germination within sporangia rather than spore release , as in non-seed plants . a current example of how this might have happened can be seen in the precocious spore germination in selaginella , the spike-moss . the result for the ancestors of angiosperms was enclosing them in a case , the seed . the first seed bearing plants , like the ginkgo , and conifers ( such as pines and firs ) , did not produce flowers . the pollen grains ( males ) of ginkgo and cycads produce a pair of flagellated , mobile sperm cells that " swim " down the developing pollen tube to the female and her eggs .
dissatisfaction with the conduct of the war was growing with the public in the uk and in other countries , aggravated by reports of fiascos , especially the humiliating defeat of the charge of the light brigade at the battle of balaclava . on sunday , 21 january 1855 , a " snowball riot " occurred in trafalgar square near st. martin-in-the-field in which 1,500 people gathered to protest against the war by pelting buses , cabs , and pedestrians with snow balls . when the police intervened , the snowballs were directed at them . the riot was finally put down by troops and police acting with truncheons . in parliament , tories demanded an accounting of all soldiers , cavalry and sailors sent to the crimea and accurate figures as to the number of casualties that had been sustained by all british armed forces in the crimea ; they were especially concerned with the battle of balaclava . when parliament passed a bill to investigate by the vote of 305 to 148 , aberdeen said he had lost a vote of no confidence and resigned as prime minister on 30 january 1855 . the veteran former foreign secretary lord palmerston became prime minister . palmerston took a hard line ; he wanted to expand the war , foment unrest inside the russian empire , and permanently reduce the russian threat to europe . sweden and prussia were willing to join the uk and france , and russia was isolated . : 400-402 , 406-408
the book has also been adapted as a play by christopher sergel . it debuted in 1990 in monroeville , a town that labels itself " the literary capital of alabama . " the play runs every may on the county courthouse grounds and townspeople make up the cast . white male audience members are chosen at the intermission to make up the jury . during the courtroom scene the production moves into the monroe county courthouse and the audience is racially segregated . author albert murray said of the relationship of the town to the novel ( and the annual performance ) : " it becomes part of the town ritual , like the religious underpinning of mardi gras . with the whole town crowded around the actual courthouse , it 's part of a central , civic education - what monroeville aspires to be . "
carnival celebrations , usually referred to as mardi gras ( fat tuesday in french ) , were first celebrated in the gulf coast area , but now occur in many states . customs originated in the onetime french colonial capitals of mobile ( now in alabama ) , new orleans ( louisiana ) and biloxi ( mississippi ) , all of which have celebrated for many years with street parades and masked balls . other major american cities with celebrations include washington , dc ; st. louis , missouri ; san francisco ; san diego ; galveston , texas ; and miami , pensacola , tampa , and orlando in florida .
on december 3 , 2013 , adidas officially confirmed a new shoe collaboration deal with west . after months of anticipation and rumors , west confirmed the release of the adidas yeezy boosts with a twitter announcement directing fans to the domain yeezy.supply. in 2015 , west unveiled his yeezy season clothing line , premiering season 1 in collaboration with adidas early in the year . the release of the yeezy boosts and the full adidas collaboration was showcased in new york city on february 12 , 2015 , with free streaming to 50 cinemas in 13 countries around the world . an initial release of the adidas yeezy boosts was limited to 9000 pairs to be available only in new york city via the adidas smartphone app ; the adidas yeezy boosts were sold out within 10 minutes . the shoes released worldwide on february 28 , 2015 , were limited to select boutique stores and the adidas uk stores . he followed with season 2 later that year at new york fashion week . on february 11 , west premiered his yeezy season 3 clothing line at madison square garden in conjunction with the previewing of his album the life of pablo .
in and out tokens contain a seven-bit device number and four-bit function number ( for multifunction devices ) and command the device to transmit datax packets , or receive the following datax packets , respectively . an in token expects a response from a device . the response may be a nak or stall response , or a datax frame . in the latter case , the host issues an ack handshake if appropriate . an out token is followed immediately by a datax frame . the device responds with ack , nak , nyet , or stall , as appropriate .
in each case , cables are attached to a hitch plate on top of the cab or may be " underslung " below a cab , and then looped over the drive sheave to a counterweight attached to the opposite end of the cables which reduces the amount of power needed to move the cab . the counterweight is located in the hoist-way and rides a separate railway system ; as the car goes up , the counterweight goes down , and vice versa . this action is powered by the traction machine which is directed by the controller , typically a relay logic or computerized device that directs starting , acceleration , deceleration and stopping of the elevator cab . the weight of the counterweight is typically equal to the weight of the elevator cab plus 40-50 % of the capacity of the elevator . the grooves in the drive sheave are specially designed to prevent the cables from slipping . " traction " is provided to the ropes by the grip of the grooves in the sheave , thereby the name . as the ropes age and the traction grooves wear , some traction is lost and the ropes must be replaced and the sheave repaired or replaced . sheave and rope wear may be significantly reduced by ensuring that all ropes have equal tension , thus sharing the load evenly . rope tension equalization may be achieved using a rope tension gauge , and is a simple way to extend the lifetime of the sheaves and ropes .
in december 1943 , president roosevelt decided that eisenhower - not marshall - would be supreme allied commander in europe . the following month , he resumed command of etousa and the following month was officially designated as the supreme allied commander of the allied expeditionary force ( shaef ) , serving in a dual role until the end of hostilities in europe in may 1945 . he was charged in these positions with planning and carrying out the allied assault on the coast of normandy in june 1944 under the code name operation overlord , the liberation of western europe and the invasion of germany .
for example , one might refer to the a above middle c as a ' , a4 , or 440 hz . in standard western equal temperament , the notion of pitch is insensitive to " spelling " : the description " g4 double sharp " refers to the same pitch as a4 ; in other temperaments , these may be distinct pitches . human perception of musical intervals is approximately logarithmic with respect to fundamental frequency : the perceived interval between the pitches " a220 " and " a440 " is the same as the perceived interval between the pitches a440 and a880 . motivated by this logarithmic perception , music theorists sometimes represent pitches using a numerical scale based on the logarithm of fundamental frequency . for example , one can adopt the widely used midi standard to map fundamental frequency , f , to a real number , p , as follows
seen in its wider social context , greek revival architecture sounded a new note of sobriety and restraint in public buildings in britain around 1800 as an assertion of nationalism attendant on the act of union , the napoleonic wars , and the clamour for political reform . it was to be william wilkins 's winning design for the public competition for downing college , cambridge that announced the greek style was to be the dominant idiom in architecture . wilkins and robert smirke went on to build some of the most important buildings of the era , including the theatre royal , covent garden ( 1808-09 ) , the general post office ( 1824-29 ) and the british museum ( 1823-48 ) , wilkins university college london ( 1826-30 ) and the national gallery ( 1832-38 ) . in scotland , thomas hamilton ( 1784-1858 ) , in collaboration with the artists andrew wilson ( 1780-1848 ) and hugh william williams ( 1773-1829 ) created monuments and buildings of international significance ; the burns monument at alloway ( 1818 ) and the ( royal ) high school in edinburgh ( 1823-29 ) .
23-year-old candice glover won the season with kree harrison taking the runner-up spot . glover is the first female to win american idol since jordin sparks . glover released " i am beautiful " as a single while harrison released " all cried out " immediately after the show . glover sold poorly with her debut album , and this is also the first season that the runner-up was not signed by a music label .
in its april 2010 report , progressive ethics watchdog group citizens for responsibility and ethics in washington named schwarzenegger one of 11 " worst governors " in the united states because of various ethics issues throughout schwarzenegger 's term as governor .
gautama was now determined to complete his spiritual quest . at the age of 35 , he famously sat in meditation under a ficus religiosa tree now called the bodhi tree in the town of bodh gaya and vowed not to rise before achieving enlightenment . after many days , he finally destroyed the fetters of his mind , thereby liberating himself from the cycle of suffering and rebirth , and arose as a fully enlightened being ( skt. samyaksambuddha ) . soon thereafter , he attracted a band of followers and instituted a monastic order . now , as the buddha , he spent the rest of his life teaching the path of awakening he had discovered , traveling throughout the northeastern part of the indian subcontinent , and died at the age of 80 ( 483 bce ) in kushinagar , india . the south branch of the original fig tree available only in anuradhapura sri lanka is known as jaya sri maha bodhi .
y-gerat was the most complex system of the three . it was , in effect , an automatic beam-tracking system , operated through the bomber 's autopilot . the single approach beam along which the bomber tracked was monitored by a ground controller . the signals from the station were retransmitted by the bomber 's equipment . this way the distance the bomber travelled along the beam could be precisely verified . direction-finding checks also enabled the controller to keep the crew on an exact course . the crew would be ordered to drop their bombs either by issue of a code word by the ground controller , or at the conclusion of the signal transmissions which would stop . although its maximum usable range was similar to the previous systems , it was not unknown for specific buildings to be hit .
indoors , neoclassicism made a discovery of the genuine classic interior , inspired by the rediscoveries at pompeii and herculaneum . these had begun in the late 1740s , but only achieved a wide audience in the 1760s , with the first luxurious volumes of tightly controlled distribution of le antichita di ercolano ( the antiquities of herculaneum ) . the antiquities of herculaneum showed that even the most classicising interiors of the baroque , or the most " roman " rooms of william kent were based on basilica and temple exterior architecture turned outside in , hence their often bombastic appearance to modern eyes : pedimented window frames turned into gilded mirrors , fireplaces topped with temple fronts .
at the time of the fall of the egyptian monarchy in the early 1950s , less than half a million egyptians were considered upper class and rich , four million middle class and 17 million lower class and poor . fewer than half of all primary-school-age children attended school , most of them being boys . nasser 's policies changed this . land reform and distribution , the dramatic growth in university education , and government support to national industries greatly improved social mobility and flattened the social curve . from academic year 1953-54 through 1965-66 , overall public school enrolments more than doubled . millions of previously poor egyptians , through education and jobs in the public sector , joined the middle class . doctors , engineers , teachers , lawyers , journalists , constituted the bulk of the swelling middle class in egypt under nasser . during the 1960s , the egyptian economy went from sluggish to the verge of collapse , the society became less free , and nasser 's appeal waned considerably .
in addition to films , turner classic movies also airs original content , mostly documentaries about classic movie personalities , the world of filmmaking and particularly notable films . an occasional month-long series , race and hollywood , showcases films by and about people of non-white races , featuring discussions of how these pictures influenced white people 's image of said races , as well as how people of those races viewed themselves . previous installments have included " asian images on film " in 2008 , " native american images on film " in 2010 , " black images on film " in 2006 " latino images on film " in 2009 and " arab images on film " in 2011 . the network aired the film series screened out ( which explored the history and depiction of homosexuality in film ) in 2007 and religion on film ( focusing on the role of religion in cinematic works ) in 2005 . in 2011 , tcm debuted a new series entitled afi 's master class : the art of collaboration .
his first professional tv job came when he was hired to direct one of the segments for the 1969 pilot episode of night gallery . the segment , " eyes , " starred joan crawford ; she and spielberg were reportedly close friends until her death . the episode is unusual in his body of work , in that the camerawork is more highly stylized than his later , more " mature " films . after this , and an episode of marcus welby , m.d. , spielberg got his first feature-length assignment : an episode of the name of the game called " l.a. 2017 . " this futuristic science fiction episode impressed universal studios and they signed him to a short contract . he did another segment on night gallery and did some work for shows such as owen marshall : counselor at law and the psychiatrist , before landing the first series episode of columbo ( previous episodes were actually tv films ) .
tracks of the northern pacific railroad ( npr ) reached montana from the west in 1881 and from the east in 1882 . however , the railroad played a major role in sparking tensions with native american tribes in the 1870s . jay cooke , the npr president launched major surveys into the yellowstone valley in 1871 , 1872 and 1873 which were challenged forcefully by the sioux under chief sitting bull . these clashes , in part , contributed to the panic of 1873 which delayed construction of the railroad into montana . surveys in 1874 , 1875 and 1876 helped spark the great sioux war of 1876 . the transcontinental npr was completed on september 8 , 1883 , at gold creek .
these court categories were not , however , wholly exclusive : for instance , the islamic courts - which were the empire 's primary courts - could also be used to settle a trade conflict or disputes between litigants of differing religions , and jews and christians often went to them to obtain a more forceful ruling on an issue . the ottoman state tended not to interfere with non-muslim religious law systems , despite legally having a voice to do so through local governors . the islamic sharia law system had been developed from a combination of the qur 'an ; the hadith , or words of the prophet muhammad ; ijma ' , or consensus of the members of the muslim community ; qiyas , a system of analogical reasoning from earlier precedents ; and local customs . both systems were taught at the empire 's law schools , which were in istanbul and bursa .
from 1869 until 1982 , seattle was known as the " queen city . " seattle 's current official nickname is the " emerald city , " the result of a contest held in 1981 ; the reference is to the lush evergreen forests of the area . seattle is also referred to informally as the " gateway to alaska " for being the nearest major city in the contiguous us to alaska , " rain city " for its frequent cloudy and rainy weather , and " jet city " from the local influence of boeing . the city has two official slogans or mottos : " the city of flowers , " meant to encourage the planting of flowers to beautify the city , and " the city of goodwill , " adopted prior to the 1990 goodwill games . seattle residents are known as seattleites .
from the semi-finals onwards , the fate of the contestants is decided by public vote . during the contestant 's performance as well as the recap at the end , a toll-free telephone number for each contestant is displayed on the screen . for a two-hour period after the episode ends ( up to four hours for the finale ) in each us time zone , viewers may call or send a text message to their preferred contestant 's telephone number , and each call or text message is registered as a vote for that contestant . viewers are allowed to vote as many times as they can within the two-hour voting window . however , the show reserves the right to discard votes by power dialers . one or more of the least popular contestants may be eliminated in successive weeks until a winner emerges . over 110 million votes were cast in the first season , and by season ten the seasonal total had increased to nearly 750 million . voting via text messaging was made available in the second season when at & t wireless joined as a sponsor of the show , and 7.5 million text messages were sent to american idol that season . the number of text messages rapidly increased , reaching 178 million texts by season eight . online voting was offered for the first time in season ten . the votes are counted and verified by telescope inc .
the emperor was at the pinnacle of han society . he presided over the han government but shared power with both the nobility and appointed ministers who came largely from the scholarly gentry class . the han empire was divided into areas directly controlled by the central government using an innovation inherited from the qin known as commanderies , and a number of semi-autonomous kingdoms . these kingdoms gradually lost all vestiges of their independence , particularly following the rebellion of the seven states . from the reign of emperor wu onward , the chinese court officially sponsored confucianism in education and court politics , synthesized with the cosmology of later scholars such as dong zhongshu . this policy endured until the fall of the qing dynasty in ad 1911 .
most animals indirectly use the energy of sunlight by eating plants or plant-eating animals . most plants use light to convert inorganic molecules in their environment into carbohydrates , fats , proteins and other biomolecules , characteristically containing reduced carbon in the form of carbon-hydrogen bonds . starting with carbon dioxide ( co2 ) and water ( h2o ) , photosynthesis converts the energy of sunlight into chemical energy in the form of simple sugars ( e.g. , glucose ) , with the release of molecular oxygen . these sugars are then used as the building blocks for plant growth , including the production of other biomolecules . when an animal eats plants ( or eats other animals which have eaten plants ) , the reduced carbon compounds in the food become a source of energy and building materials for the animal . they are either used directly to help the animal grow , or broken down , releasing stored solar energy , and giving the animal the energy required for motion .
at the beginning of the 1930s , the nazi party 's rise to power increased tensions between germany and the soviet union along with other countries with ethnic slavs , who were considered " untermenschen " ( inferior ) according to nazi racial ideology . moreover , the anti-semitic nazis associated ethnic jews with both communism and financial capitalism , both of which they opposed . consequently , nazi theory held that slavs in the soviet union were being ruled by " jewish bolshevik " masters . in 1934 , hitler himself had spoken of an inescapable battle against both pan-slavism and neo-slavism , the victory in which would lead to " permanent mastery of the world , " though he stated that they would " walk part of the road with the russians , if that will help us . " the resulting manifestation of german anti-bolshevism and an increase in soviet foreign debts caused german-soviet trade to dramatically decline . [ b ] imports of soviet goods to germany fell to 223 million reichsmarks in 1934 as the more isolationist stalinist regime asserted power and the abandonment of post-world war i treaty of versailles military controls decreased germany 's reliance on soviet imports .

antarctica , on average , is the coldest , driest , and windiest continent , and has the highest average elevation of all the continents . antarctica is considered a desert , with annual precipitation of only 200 mm ( 8 in ) along the coast and far less inland . the temperature in antarctica has reached − 89.2 ° c ( − 128.6 ° f ) , though the average for the third quarter ( the coldest part of the year ) is − 63 ° c ( − 81 ° f ) . there are no permanent human residents , but anywhere from 1,000 to 5,000 people reside throughout the year at the research stations scattered across the continent . organisms native to antarctica include many types of algae , bacteria , fungi , plants , protista , and certain animals , such as mites , nematodes , penguins , seals and tardigrades . vegetation , where it occurs , is tundra .
the atlantic ocean has less influence on the climate of the piedmont region , which has hotter summers and colder winters than in the coast . daytime highs in the piedmont often reach over 90 ° f ( 32 ° c ) in the summer . while it is not common for the temperature to reach over 100 ° f ( 38 ° c ) in the state , such temperatures , when they occur , typically are found only in the lower-elevation areas of the piedmont and far-inland areas of the coastal plain . the weaker influence of the atlantic ocean also means that temperatures in the piedmont often fluctuate more widely than in the coast .
the si unit of illuminance and luminous emittance , being the luminous power per area , is measured in lux . it is used in photometry as a measure of the intensity , as perceived by the human eye , of light that hits or passes through a surface . it is analogous to the radiometric unit watts per square metre , but with the power at each wavelength weighted according to the luminosity function , a standardized model of human visual brightness perception . in english , " lux " is used in both singular and plural .
although this period had been productive , the bad weather had such a detrimental effect on chopin 's health that sand determined to leave the island . to avoid further customs duties , sand sold the piano to a local french couple , the canuts . [ n 8 ] the group traveled first to barcelona , then to marseilles , where they stayed for a few months while chopin convalesced . in may 1839 they headed for the summer to sand 's estate at nohant , where they spent most summers until 1846 . in autumn they returned to paris , where chopin 's apartment at 5 rue tronchet was close to sand 's rented accommodation at the rue pigalle . he frequently visited sand in the evenings , but both retained some independence . in 1842 he and sand moved to the square d 'orleans , living in adjacent buildings .
chopin seldom performed publicly in paris . in later years he generally gave a single annual concert at the salle pleyel , a venue that seated three hundred . he played more frequently at salons , but preferred playing at his own paris apartment for small groups of friends . the musicologist arthur hedley has observed that " as a pianist chopin was unique in acquiring a reputation of the highest order on the basis of a minimum of public appearances - few more than thirty in the course of his lifetime . " the list of musicians who took part in some of his concerts provides an indication of the richness of parisian artistic life during this period . examples include a concert on 23 march 1833 , in which chopin , liszt and hiller performed ( on pianos ) a concerto by j.s. bach for three keyboards ; and , on 3 march 1838 , a concert in which chopin , his pupil adolphe gutmann , charles-valentin alkan , and alkan 's teacher joseph zimmermann performed alkan 's arrangement , for eight hands , of two movements from beethoven 's 7th symphony . chopin was also involved in the composition of liszt 's hexameron ; he wrote the sixth ( and final ) variation on bellini 's theme . chopin 's music soon found success with publishers , and in 1833 he contracted with maurice schlesinger , who arranged for it to be published not only in france but , through his family connections , also in germany and england .
the reinforcement type defines two major classes of materials - woven and non-woven . woven reinforcements are cheaper , but the high dielectric constant of glass may not be favorable for many higher-frequency applications . the spatially nonhomogeneous structure also introduces local variations in electrical parameters , due to different resin / glass ratio at different areas of the weave pattern . nonwoven reinforcements , or materials with low or no reinforcement , are more expensive but more suitable for some rf / analog applications .
humans have shown extreme inventiveness in devising clothing solutions to environmental hazards . examples include : space suits , air conditioned clothing , armor , diving suits , swimsuits , bee-keeper gear , motorcycle leathers , high-visibility clothing , and other pieces of protective clothing . meanwhile , the distinction between clothing and protective equipment is not always clear-cut - since clothes designed to be fashionable often have protective value and clothes designed for function often consider fashion in their design . wearing clothes also has social implications . they cover parts of the body that social norms require to be covered , act as a form of adornment , and serve other social purposes .
upon the invitation of duke konrad i of masovia , the teutonic knights took possession of prussia in the 13th century and created a monastic state to administer the conquered old prussians . local old-prussian ( north ) and polish ( south ) toponyms were gradually germanised . the knights ' expansionist policies , including occupation of polish pomerania with gdansk / danzig and western lithuania , brought them into conflict with the kingdom of poland and embroiled them in several wars , culminating in the polish-lithuanian-teutonic war , whereby the united armies of poland and lithuania , defeated the teutonic order at the battle of grunwald ( tannenberg ) in 1410 . its defeat was formalised in the second treaty of thorn in 1466 ending the thirteen years ' war , and leaving the former polish region pomerania / pomerelia under polish control . together with warmia it formed the province of royal prussia . eastern prussia remained under the knights , but as a fief of poland . 1466 and 1525 arrangements by kings of poland were not verified by the holy roman empire as well as the previous gains of the teutonic knights were not verified .
in the context of cultural studies , the idea of a text includes not only written language , but also films , photographs , fashion or hairstyles : the texts of cultural studies comprise all the meaningful artifacts of culture . [ citation needed ] similarly , the discipline widens the concept of " culture . " " culture " for a cultural-studies researcher not only includes traditional high culture ( the culture of ruling social groups ) and popular culture , but also everyday meanings and practices . the last two , in fact , have become the main focus of cultural studies . a further and recent approach is comparative cultural studies , based on the disciplines of comparative literature and cultural studies .

accounts of the use of leeches for the medically dubious practise of blood-letting have come from china around 30 ad , india around 200 ad , ancient rome around 50 ad and later throughout europe . in the 19th century medical demand for leeches was so high that some areas ' stocks were exhausted and other regions imposed restrictions or bans on exports , and hirudo medicinalis is treated as an endangered species by both iucn and cites . more recently leeches have been used to assist in microsurgery , and their saliva has provided anti-inflammatory compounds and several important anticoagulants , one of which also prevents tumors from spreading .
president benito juarez was re-elected in the general election of 1867 in which he received strong liberal support , especially in chihuahua . luis terrazas was confirmed by the people of chihuahua to be governor of the state . but soon after the election , president juarez had another crisis on his hands ; the juarez administration was suspected to be involved in the assassination of the military chief jose maria patoni executed by general canto in august 1868 . general canto turned himself over to donato guerra . canto was sentenced to death , but later his sentence changed to 10 years imprisonment . the sense of injustice gave rise to a new rebellion in 1869 that threatened the federal government . in response , the juarez administration took drastic measures by temporarily suspending constitutional rights , but the governor of chihuahua did not support this action . hostilities continued to increase especially after the election of 1871 which was perceived to be fraudulent . a new popular leader arose among the rebels , porfirio diaz . the federal government was successful in quelling rebellions in durango an chihuahua . on july 18 , 1872 , president juarez died from a heart attack ; soon after , many of his supporters ceased the fighting . peace returned to chihuahua and the new government was led by governor antonio ochoa ( formerly a co-owner of the batopilas silver mines ) in 1873 after luis terrazas finished his term in 1872 .
during the first half of the 1920s , engineers at western electric , as well as independent inventors such as orlando marsh , developed technology for capturing sound with a microphone , amplifying it with vacuum tubes , then using the amplified signal to drive an electromagnetic recording head . western electric 's innovations resulted in a greatly expanded and more even frequency response , creating a dramatically fuller , clearer and more natural-sounding recording . distant or less strong sounds that were impossible to record by the old methods could now be captured . volume was now limited only by the groove spacing on the record and the limitations of the intended playback device . victor and columbia licensed the new electrical system from western electric and began issuing electrically recorded discs in 1925 . the first classical recording was of chopin impromptus and schubert 's litanei by alfred cortot for victor .
in lossy audio compression , methods of psychoacoustics are used to remove non-audible ( or less audible ) components of the audio signal . compression of human speech is often performed with even more specialized techniques ; speech coding , or voice coding , is sometimes distinguished as a separate discipline from audio compression . different audio and speech compression standards are listed under audio coding formats . voice compression is used in internet telephony , for example , audio compression is used for cd ripping and is decoded by the audio players .
during the middle decades of the 18th century , there were several outbreaks of military conflict on the indian subcontinent , the carnatic wars , as the english east india company ( the company ) and its french counterpart , the compagnie francaise des indes orientales , struggled alongside local rulers to fill the vacuum that had been left by the decline of the mughal empire . the battle of plassey in 1757 , in which the british , led by robert clive , defeated the nawab of bengal and his french allies , left the company in control of bengal and as the major military and political power in india . france was left control of its enclaves but with military restrictions and an obligation to support british client states , ending french hopes of controlling india . in the following decades the company gradually increased the size of the territories under its control , either ruling directly or via local rulers under the threat of force from the british indian army , the vast majority of which was composed of indian sepoys .
chopin 's tombstone , featuring the muse of music , euterpe , weeping over a broken lyre , was designed and sculpted by clesinger . the expenses of the funeral and monument , amounting to 5,000 francs , were covered by jane stirling , who also paid for the return of the composer 's sister ludwika to warsaw . ludwika took chopin 's heart in an urn , preserved in alcohol , back to poland in 1850 . [ n 9 ] she also took a collection of two hundred letters from sand to chopin ; after 1851 these were returned to sand , who seems to have destroyed them .
central state-owned enterprises have accumulatively donated more than $ 48.6 million . china national petroleum corp and sinopec donated 10 million yuan each to the disaster area .
holometabolism , or complete metamorphosis , is where the insect changes in four stages , an egg or embryo , a larva , a pupa and the adult or imago . in these species , an egg hatches to produce a larva , which is generally worm-like in form . this worm-like form can be one of several varieties : eruciform ( caterpillar-like ) , scarabaeiform ( grub-like ) , campodeiform ( elongated , flattened and active ) , elateriform ( wireworm-like ) or vermiform ( maggot-like ) . the larva grows and eventually becomes a pupa , a stage marked by reduced movement and often sealed within a cocoon . there are three types of pupae : obtect , exarate or coarctate . obtect pupae are compact , with the legs and other appendages enclosed . exarate pupae have their legs and other appendages free and extended . coarctate pupae develop inside the larval skin . : 151 insects undergo considerable change in form during the pupal stage , and emerge as adults . butterflies are a well-known example of insects that undergo complete metamorphosis , although most insects use this life cycle . some insects have evolved this system to hypermetamorphosis .
according to thomas degregori , an economics professor at the university of houston , in an article published by the cato institute , a libertarian think-tank operating in washington d.c. , " it is clear that technological and economic change are vital ingredients in getting children out of the workplace and into schools . then they can grow to become productive adults and live longer , healthier lives . however , in poor countries like bangladesh , working children are essential for survival in many families , as they were in our own heritage until the late 19th century . so , while the struggle to end child labour is necessary , getting there often requires taking different routes - and , sadly , there are many political obstacles .
an ancient indian treatise on statecraft , economic policy and military strategy by kautilya and vishnugupta , who are traditionally identified with chanakya ( c . 350--283 bce ) . in this treatise , the behaviors and relationships of the people , the king , the state , the government superintendents , courtiers , enemies , invaders , and corporations are analysed and documented . roger boesche describes the arthasastra as " a book of political realism , a book analysing how the political world does work and not very often stating how it ought to work , a book that frequently discloses to a king what calculating and sometimes brutal measures he must carry out to preserve the state and the common good . "

architecture ( latin architectura , from the greek αρχιτεκτων arkhitekton " architect , " from αρχι- " chief " and τεκτων " builder " ) is both the process and the product of planning , designing , and constructing buildings and other physical structures . architectural works , in the material form of buildings , are often perceived as cultural symbols and as works of art . historical civilizations are often identified with their surviving architectural achievements .
the relational model also allowed the content of the database to evolve without constant rewriting of links and pointers . the relational part comes from entities referencing other entities in what is known as one-to-many relationship , like a traditional hierarchical model , and many-to-many relationship , like a navigational ( network ) model . thus , a relational model can express both hierarchical and navigational models , as well as its native tabular model , allowing for pure or combined modeling in terms of these three models , as the application requires .
the bronx is referred to , both legally and colloquially , with a definite article , as the bronx . ( the county of bronx , unlike the coextensive borough of the bronx , does not place the immediately before bronx in formal references , nor does the united states postal service in its database of bronx addresses . ) the name for this region , apparently after the bronx river , first appeared in the annexed district of the bronx created in 1874 out of part of westchester county and was continued in the borough of the bronx , which included a larger annexation from westchester county in 1898 . the use of the definite article is attributed to the style of referring to rivers . another explanation for the use of the definite article in the borough 's name is that the original form of the name was a possessive or collective one referring to the family , as in visiting the broncks , the bronck 's or the broncks ' .
in his native poland , in france , where he composed most of his works , and beyond , chopin 's music , his status as one of music 's earliest superstars , his association ( if only indirect ) with political insurrection , his love life and his early death have made him , in the public consciousness , a leading symbol of the romantic era . his works remain popular , and he has been the subject of numerous films and biographies of varying degrees of historical accuracy .
capacitors may have their connecting leads arranged in many configurations , for example axially or radially . " axial " means that the leads are on a common axis , typically the axis of the capacitor 's cylindrical body - the leads extend from opposite ends . radial leads might more accurately be referred to as tandem ; they are rarely actually aligned along radii of the body 's circle , so the term is inexact , although universal . the leads ( until bent ) are usually in planes parallel to that of the flat body of the capacitor , and extend in the same direction ; they are often parallel as manufactured .
in the u.s. , the music was being developed to create a more sophisticated sound , [ citation needed ] moving beyond just drum loops and short samples . in chicago , marshall jefferson had formed the house group ten city byron burke , byron stingily & herb lawson ( from " intensity " ) . new york-based performers such as mateo & matos and blaze had slickly produced disco house tracks . in detroit a proto-techno music sound began to emerge with the recordings of juan atkins , derrick may and kevin saunderson .
vinyl pressings were made with stampers from master cuts that were electroplated in vacuo by means of gold sputtering . audio response was claimed out to 8,000 hz , later 13,000 hz , using light weight pickups employing jeweled styli . amplifiers and cutters both using negative feedback were employed thereby improving the range of frequencies cut and lowering distortion levels . radio transcription producers such as world broadcasting system and associated music publishers ( amp ) were the dominant licensees of the western electric wide range system and towards the end of the 1930s were responsible for two-thirds of the total radio transcription business . these recordings use a bass turnover of 300 hz and a 10,000 hz rolloff of − 8.5 db .
chapter x examines whether patterns in the fossil record are better explained by common descent and branching evolution through natural selection , than by the individual creation of fixed species . darwin expected species to change slowly , but not at the same rate - some organisms such as lingula were unchanged since the earliest fossils . the pace of natural selection would depend on variability and change in the environment . this distanced his theory from lamarckian laws of inevitable progress . it has been argued that this anticipated the punctuated equilibrium hypothesis , but other scholars have preferred to emphasise darwin 's commitment to gradualism . he cited richard owen 's findings that the earliest members of a class were a few simple and generalised species with characteristics intermediate between modern forms , and were followed by increasingly diverse and specialised forms , matching the branching of common descent from an ancestor . patterns of extinction matched his theory , with related groups of species having a continued existence until extinction , then not reappearing . recently extinct species were more similar to living species than those from earlier eras , and as he had seen in south america , and william clift had shown in australia , fossils from recent geological periods resembled species still living in the same area .
the 15th century was a time of islamic economic expansion , known as the valencian golden age , in which culture and the arts flourished . concurrent population growth made valencia the most populous city in the crown of aragon . local industry , led by textile production , reached a great development , and a financial institution , the canvi de taula , was created to support municipal banking operations ; valencian bankers lent funds to queen isabella i of castile for columbus 's voyage in 1492 . at the end of the century the silk exchange ( llotja de la seda ) building was erected as the city became a commercial emporium that attracted merchants from all over europe .

portugal is a significant european minerals producer and is ranked among europe 's leading copper producers . the nation is also a notable producer of tin , tungsten and uranium . however , the country lacks the potential to conduct hydrocarbon exploration and aluminium , a limitation that has hindered the development of portugal 's mining and metallurgy sectors . although the country has vast iron and coal reserves - mainly in the north - after the 1974 revolution and the consequent economic globalization , low competitiveness forced a decrease in the extraction activity for these minerals . the panasqueira and neves-corvo mines are among the most recognised portuguese mines that are still in operation .

orthodox judaism holds that on mount sinai , the written law was transmitted along with an oral law . the words of the torah ( pentateuch ) were spoken to moses by god ; the laws contained in this written torah , the " mitzvot , " were given along with detailed explanations in the oral tradition as to how to apply and interpret them . furthermore , the oral law includes principles designed to create new rules . the oral law is held to be transmitted with an extremely high degree of accuracy . jewish theologians , who choose to emphasize the more evolutionary nature of the halacha point to a famous story in the talmud , where moses is miraculously transported to the house of study of rabbi akiva and is clearly unable to follow the ensuing discussion .

iron is usually found as iron ore on earth , except for one deposit of native iron in greenland , which was used by the inuit people . native copper , however , was found worldwide , along with silver , gold and platinum , which were also used to make tools , jewelry , and other objects since neolithic times . copper was the hardest of these metals , and the most widely distributed . it became one of the most important metals to the ancients . eventually , humans learned to smelt metals such as copper and tin from ore , and , around 2500 bc , began alloying the two metals to form bronze , which is much harder than its ingredients . tin was rare , however , being found mostly in great britain . in the middle east , people began alloying copper with zinc to form brass . ancient civilizations took into account the mixture and the various properties it produced , such as hardness , toughness and melting point , under various conditions of temperature and work hardening , developing much of the information contained in modern alloy phase diagrams . arrowheads from the chinese qin dynasty ( around 200 bc ) were often constructed with a hard bronze-head , but a softer bronze-tang , combining the alloys to prevent both dulling and breaking during use .
the kingdom of nri of the igbo people consolidated in the 10th century and continued until it lost its sovereignty to the british in 1911 . nri was ruled by the eze nri , and the city of nri is considered to be the foundation of igbo culture . nri and aguleri , where the igbo creation myth originates , are in the territory of the umeuri clan . members of the clan trace their lineages back to the patriarchal king-figure eri . in west africa , the oldest bronzes made using the lost-wax process were from igbo ukwu , a city under nri influence .
the exodus of salvadorans was a result of both economic and political problems . the largest immigration wave occurred as a result of the salvadoran civil war in the 1980s , in which 20-30 % of el salvador 's population emigrated . about 50 % , or up to 500,000 of those who escaped headed to the united states , which was already home to over 10,000 salvadorans , making salvadorans americans the fourth-largest hispanic and latino american group , after the mexican-american majority , stateside puerto ricans , and cubans .
present-day mali was once part of three west african empires that controlled trans-saharan trade : the ghana empire , the mali empire ( for which mali is named ) , and the songhai empire . during its golden age , there was a flourishing of mathematics , astronomy , literature , and art . at its peak in 1300 , the mali empire covered an area about twice the size of modern-day france and stretched to the west coast of africa . in the late 19th century , during the scramble for africa , france seized control of mali , making it a part of french sudan . french sudan ( then known as the sudanese republic ) joined with senegal in 1959 , achieving independence in 1960 as the mali federation . shortly thereafter , following senegal 's withdrawal from the federation , the sudanese republic declared itself the independent republic of mali . after a long period of one-party rule , a coup in 1991 led to the writing of a new constitution and the establishment of mali as a democratic , multi-party state .
as an academic field , philosophy of education is " the philosophical study of education and its problems ( ... ) its central subject matter is education , and its methods are those of philosophy . " " the philosophy of education may be either the philosophy of the process of education or the philosophy of the discipline of education . that is , it may be part of the discipline in the sense of being concerned with the aims , forms , methods , or results of the process of educating or being educated ; or it may be metadisciplinary in the sense of being concerned with the concepts , aims , and methods of the discipline . " as such , it is both part of the field of education and a field of applied philosophy , drawing from fields of metaphysics , epistemology , axiology and the philosophical approaches ( speculative , prescriptive , and / or analytic ) to address questions in and about pedagogy , education policy , and curriculum , as well as the process of learning , to name a few . for example , it might study what constitutes upbringing and education , the values and norms revealed through upbringing and educational practices , the limits and legitimization of education as an academic discipline , and the relation between education theory and practice .
the armillary sphere , a three-dimensional representation of the movements in the celestial sphere , was invented in han china by the 1st century bc . using a water clock , waterwheel and a series of gears , the court astronomer zhang heng ( 78-139 ad ) was able to mechanically rotate his metal-ringed armillary sphere . to address the problem of slowed timekeeping in the pressure head of the inflow water clock , zhang was the first in china to install an additional tank between the reservoir and inflow vessel . zhang also invented a seismometer ( houfeng didong yi 候风地动仪 ) in 132 ad to detect the exact cardinal or ordinal direction of earthquakes from hundreds of kilometers away . this employed an inverted pendulum that , when disturbed by ground tremors , would trigger a set of gears that dropped a metal ball from one of eight dragon mouths ( representing all eight directions ) into a metal toad 's mouth .
in a career spanning more than four decades , spielberg 's films have covered many themes and genres . spielberg 's early science-fiction and adventure films were seen as archetypes of modern hollywood blockbuster filmmaking . in later years , his films began addressing humanistic issues such as the holocaust ( in schindler 's list ) , the transatlantic slave trade ( in amistad ) , war ( in empire of the sun , saving private ryan , war horse and bridge of spies ) and terrorism ( in munich ) . his other films include close encounters of the third kind , the indiana jones film series , and a.i. artificial intelligence .
the most popular contestants are usually not revealed in the results show . instead , typically the three contestants ( two in later rounds ) who received the lowest number of votes are called to the center of the stage . one of these three is usually sent to safety ; however the two remaining are not necessarily the bottom two . the contestant with the fewest votes is then revealed and eliminated from the competition . a montage of the eliminated contestant 's time on the show is played and they give their final performance . however , in season six , during the series ' first ever idol gives back episode , no contestant was eliminated , but on the following week , two were sent home . moreover , starting in season eight , the judges may overturn viewers ' decision with a " judges ' save " if they unanimously agree to . " the save " can only be used once , and only up through the top five . in the eighth , ninth , tenth , and fourteenth seasons , a double elimination then took place in the week following the activation of the save , but in the eleventh and thirteenth seasons , a regular single elimination took place . the save was not activated in the twelfth season and consequently , a non-elimination took place in the week after its expiration with the votes then carrying over into the following week .
university hospital southampton nhs foundation trust is one of the city 's largest employers . it provides local hospital services to 500,000 people in the southampton area and specialist regional services to more than 3 million people across the south of england . the trust owns and manages southampton general hospital , the princess anne hospital and a palliative care service at countess mountbatten house , part of the moorgreen hospital site in the village of west end , just outside the city .
between the 8th and 18th centuries , the use of glazed ceramics was prevalent in islamic art , usually assuming the form of elaborate pottery . tin-opacified glazing was one of the earliest new technologies developed by the islamic potters . the first islamic opaque glazes can be found as blue-painted ware in basra , dating to around the 8th century . another contribution was the development of stone-paste ceramics , originating from 9th century iraq . other centers for innovative ceramic pottery in the old world included fustat ( from 975 to 1075 ) , damascus ( from 1100 to around 1600 ) and tabriz ( from 1470 to 1550 ) .
the foundation of northwestern university is traceable to a meeting on may 31 , 1850 of nine prominent chicago businessmen , methodist leaders and attorneys who had formed the idea of establishing a university to serve what had once been known as the northwest territory . on january 28 , 1851 , the illinois general assembly granted a charter to the trustees of the north-western university , making it the first chartered university in illinois . the school 's nine founders , all of whom were methodists ( three of them ministers ) , knelt in prayer and worship before launching their first organizational meeting . although they affiliated the university with the methodist episcopal church , they were committed to non-sectarian admissions , believing that northwestern should serve all people in the newly developing territory .
in 1274 , the mongol-founded yuan dynasty in china sent a force of some 40,000 men and 900 ships to invade japan in northern kyushu . japan mustered a mere 10,000 samurai to meet this threat . the invading army was harassed by major thunderstorms throughout the invasion , which aided the defenders by inflicting heavy casualties . the yuan army was eventually recalled and the invasion was called off . the mongol invaders used small bombs , which was likely the first appearance of bombs and gunpowder in japan .
efforts have been made to improve nutrition , and reduce associated health problems , by encouraging women to make nutritious versions of local recipes . for example , the international crops research institute for the semi-arid tropics ( icrisat ) and the aga khan foundation , trained women 's groups to make equinut , a healthy and nutritional version of the traditional recipe di-degue ( comprising peanut paste , honey and millet or rice flour ) . the aim was to boost nutrition and livelihoods by producing a product that women could make and sell , and which would be accepted by the local community because of its local heritage .
the great plains lie west of the mississippi river and east of the rocky mountains . a large portion of the country 's agricultural products are grown in the great plains . before their general conversion to farmland , the great plains were noted for their extensive grasslands , from tallgrass prairie in the eastern plains to shortgrass steppe in the western high plains . elevation rises gradually from less than a few hundred feet near the mississippi river to more than a mile high in the high plains . the generally low relief of the plains is broken in several places , most notably in the ozark and ouachita mountains , which form the u.s. interior highlands , the only major mountainous region between the rocky mountains and the appalachian mountains .
during the dictatorships of miguel primo de rivera ( 1923-1930 ) and especially of francisco franco ( 1939-1975 ) , all regional cultures were suppressed . all of the languages spoken in spanish territory , except spanish ( castilian ) itself , were officially banned . symbolising the catalan people 's desire for freedom , barca became ' more than a club ' ( mes que un club ) for the catalans . according to manuel vazquez montalban , the best way for the catalans to demonstrate their identity was by joining barca . it was less risky than joining a clandestine anti-franco movement , and allowed them to express their dissidence . during franco 's regime , however , the blaugrana team was granted profit due to its good relationship with the dictator at management level , even giving two awards to him .
the dutch language has been known under a variety of names . in middle dutch , which was a collection of dialects , dietsc was used in flanders and brabant , while diets or duutsc was in use in the northern netherlands . it derived from the old germanic word theudisk , one of the first names ever used for the non-romance languages of western europe , meaning ( pertaining to the language ) of the people , that is , the native germanic language . the term was used as opposed to latin , the non-native language of writing and the catholic church . in the first text in which it is found , dating from 784 , it refers to the germanic dialects of britain . in the oaths of strasbourg ( 842 ) it appeared as teudisca to refer to the germanic ( rhenish franconian ) portion of the oath .
the jordan rift valley is the result of tectonic movements within the dead sea transform ( dsf ) fault system . the dsf forms the transform boundary between the african plate to the west and the arabian plate to the east . the golan heights and all of jordan are part of the arabian plate , while the galilee , west bank , coastal plain , and negev along with the sinai peninsula are on the african plate . this tectonic disposition leads to a relatively high seismic activity in the region . the entire jordan valley segment is thought to have ruptured repeatedly , for instance during the last two major earthquakes along this structure in 749 and 1033 . the deficit in slip that has built up since the 1033 event is sufficient to cause an earthquake of mw ~ 7.4 .
the us and ussr began discussions on the peaceful uses of space as early as 1958 , presenting issues for debate to the united nations , which created a committee on the peaceful uses of outer space in 1959 .
saint-barthelemy ( french : saint-barthelemy , french pronunciation : [ sɛ  baʁtelemi ] ) , officially the territorial collectivity of saint-barthelemy ( french : collectivite territoriale de saint-barthelemy ) , is an overseas collectivity of france . often abbreviated to saint-barth in french , or st. barts or st. barths in english , the indigenous people called the island ouanalao . st. barthelemy lies about 35 kilometres ( 22 mi ) southeast of st. martin and north of st. kitts . puerto rico is 240 kilometres ( 150 mi ) to the west in the greater antilles .
an estimated 20,000 somalis emigrated to the u.s. state of minnesota some ten years ago and the twin cities ( minneapolis and saint paul ) now have the highest population of somalis in north america . the city of minneapolis hosts hundreds of somali-owned and operated businesses offering a variety of products , including leather shoes , jewelry and other fashion items , halal meat , and hawala or money transfer services . community-based video rental stores likewise carry the latest somali films and music . the number of somalis has especially surged in the cedar-riverside area of minneapolis .
pain is usually transitory , lasting only until the noxious stimulus is removed or the underlying damage or pathology has healed , but some painful conditions , such as rheumatoid arthritis , peripheral neuropathy , cancer and idiopathic pain , may persist for years . pain that lasts a long time is called chronic or persistent , and pain that resolves quickly is called acute . traditionally , the distinction between acute and chronic pain has relied upon an arbitrary interval of time from onset ; the two most commonly used markers being 3 months and 6 months since the onset of pain , though some theorists and researchers have placed the transition from acute to chronic pain at 12 months . : 93 others apply acute to pain that lasts less than 30 days , chronic to pain of more than six months ' duration , and subacute to pain that lasts from one to six months . a popular alternative definition of chronic pain , involving no arbitrarily fixed durations , is " pain that extends beyond the expected period of healing . " chronic pain may be classified as cancer pain or else as benign .
spielberg then revisited his close encounters project and , with financial backing from columbia pictures , released close encounters : the special edition in 1980 . for this , spielberg fixed some of the flaws he thought impeded the original 1977 version of the film and also , at the behest of columbia , and as a condition of spielberg revising the film , shot additional footage showing the audience the interior of the mothership seen at the end of the film ( a decision spielberg would later regret as he felt the interior of the mothership should have remained a mystery ) . nevertheless , the re-release was a moderate success , while the 2001 dvd release of the film restored the original ending .
heartwood is often visually distinct from the living sapwood , and can be distinguished in a cross-section where the boundary will tend to follow the growth rings . for example , it is sometimes much darker . however , other processes such as decay or insect invasion can also discolor wood , even in woody plants that do not form heartwood , which may lead to confusion .
tajikistan 's rivers , such as the vakhsh and the panj , have great hydropower potential , and the government has focused on attracting investment for projects for internal use and electricity exports . tajikistan is home to the nurek dam , the highest dam in the world . lately , russia 's rao ues energy giant has been working on the sangtuda-1 hydroelectric power station ( 670 mw capacity ) commenced operations on 18 january 2008 . other projects at the development stage include sangtuda-2 by iran , zerafshan by the chinese company sinohydro , and the rogun power plant that , at a projected height of 335 metres ( 1,099 ft ) , would supersede the nurek dam as highest in the world if it is brought to completion . a planned project , casa 1000 , will transmit 1000 mw of surplus electricity from tajikistan to pakistan with power transit through afghanistan . the total length of transmission line is 750 km while the project is planned to be on public-private partnership basis with the support of wb , ifc , adb and idb . the project cost is estimated to be around us $ 865 million . other energy resources include sizable coal deposits and smaller reserves of natural gas and petroleum .
however a log-periodic dipole array consists of a number of dipole elements of different lengths in order to obtain a somewhat directional antenna having an extremely wide bandwidth : these are frequently used for television reception in fringe areas . the dipole antennas composing it are all considered " active elements " since they are all electrically connected together ( and to the transmission line ) . on the other hand , a superficially similar dipole array , the yagi-uda antenna ( or simply " yagi " ) , has only one dipole element with an electrical connection ; the other so-called parasitic elements interact with the electromagnetic field in order to realize a fairly directional antenna but one which is limited to a rather narrow bandwidth . the yagi antenna has similar looking parasitic dipole elements but which act differently due to their somewhat different lengths . there may be a number of so-called " directors " in front of the active element in the direction of propagation , and usually a single ( but possibly more ) " reflector " on the opposite side of the active element .
european comics studies began with topffer 's theories of his own work in the 1840s , which emphasized panel transitions and the visual-verbal combination . no further progress was made until the 1970s . pierre fresnault-deruelle then took a semiotics approach to the study of comics , analyzing text-image relations , page-level image relations , and image discontinuities , or what scott mccloud later dubbed " closure . " in 1987 , henri vanlier introduced the term multicadre , or " multiframe , " to refer to the comics a page as a semantic unit . by the 1990s , theorists such as benoit peeters and thierry groensteen turned attention to artists ' poietic creative choices . thierry smolderen and harry morgan have held relativistic views of the definition of comics , a medium that has taken various , equally valid forms over its history . morgan sees comics as a subset of " les litteratures dessinees " ( or " drawn literatures " ) . french theory has come to give special attention to the page , in distinction from american theories such as mccloud 's which focus on panel-to-panel transitions . since the mid-2000s , neil cohn has begun analyzing how comics are understood using tools from cognitive science , extending beyond theory by using actual psychological and neuroscience experiments . this work has argued that sequential images and page layouts both use separate rule-bound " grammars " to be understood that extend beyond panel-to-panel transitions and categorical distinctions of types of layouts , and that the brain 's comprehension of comics is similar to comprehending other domains , such as language and music .
once the elevator arrives at the floor , it will park with its doors open and the car buttons will be disabled to prevent a passenger from taking control of the elevator . medical personnel must then activate the code-blue key switch inside the car , select their floor and close the doors with the door close button . the elevator will then travel non-stop to the selected floor , and will remain in code-blue service until switched off in the car . some hospital elevators will feature a ' hold ' position on the code-blue key switch ( similar to fire service ) which allows the elevator to remain at a floor locked out of service until code blue is deactivated .
insects can be divided into two groups historically treated as subclasses : wingless insects , known as apterygota , and winged insects , known as pterygota . the apterygota consist of the primitively wingless order of the silverfish ( thysanura ) . archaeognatha make up the monocondylia based on the shape of their mandibles , while thysanura and pterygota are grouped together as dicondylia . the thysanura themselves possibly are not monophyletic , with the family lepidotrichidae being a sister group to the dicondylia ( pterygota and the remaining thysanura ) .
president kennedy stated in executive order 10925 that " discrimination because of race , creed , color , or national origin is contrary to the constitutional principles and policies of the united states " ; that " it is the plain and positive obligation of the united states government to promote and ensure equal opportunity for all qualified persons , without regard to race , creed , color , or national origin , employed or seeking employment with the federal government and on government contracts " ; that " it is the policy of the executive branch of the government to encourage by positive measures equal opportunity for all qualified persons within the government " ; and that " it is in the general interest and welfare of the united states to promote its economy , security , and national defense through the most efficient and effective utilization of all available manpower . "
in november 1790 , francois-louis-thibault de menonville , a member of the national assembly of france , wrote to burke , praising reflections and requesting more " very refreshing mental food " that he could publish . this burke did in april 1791 when he published a letter to a member of the national assembly . burke called for external forces to reverse the revolution and included an attack on the late french philosopher jean-jacques rousseau , as being the subject of a personality cult that had developed in revolutionary france . although burke conceded that rousseau sometimes showed " a considerable insight into human nature " he mostly was critical . although he did not meet rousseau on his visit to britain in 1766-7 burke was a friend of david hume , with whom rousseau had stayed . burke said rousseau " entertained no principle either to influence of his heart , or to guide his understanding - but vanity " - which he " was possessed to a degree little short of madness . " he also cited rousseau 's confessions as evidence that rousseau had a life of " obscure and vulgar vices " that was not " chequered , or spotted here and there , with virtues , or even distinguished by a single good action . " burke contrasted rousseau 's theory of universal benevolence and his having sent his children to a foundling hospital : " a lover of his kind , but a hater of his kindred . "
the battle of osan , the first significant american engagement of the korean war , involved the 540-soldier task force smith , which was a small forward element of the 24th infantry division which had been flown in from japan . on 5 july 1950 , task force smith attacked the north koreans at osan but without weapons capable of destroying the north koreans ' tanks . they were unsuccessful ; the result was 180 dead , wounded , or taken prisoner . the kpa progressed southwards , pushing back the us force at pyongtaek , chonan , and chochiwon , forcing the 24th division 's retreat to taejeon , which the kpa captured in the battle of taejon ; the 24th division suffered 3,602 dead and wounded and 2,962 captured , including the division 's commander , major general william f. dean .
the name nigeria was taken from the niger river running through the country . this name was allegedly coined in the late 19th century by british journalist flora shaw , she was inspired by the name of the river , in preference to terms such as " central sudan . " the origin of the name " nigeria " came from the name of the niger river . the word ( niger ) is an alteration of the tuareg name egerew n-igerewen used by inhabitants along the middle reaches of the river around timbuktu prior to 19th-century european colonialism . egerew n-igerewen means river of the rivers .
during the republic , any person who wished to hold public office had to conform to the reformed church and take an oath to this effect . the extent to which different religions or denominations were persecuted depended much on the time period and regional or city leaders . in the beginning , this was especially focused on roman catholics , being the religion of the enemy . in 17th-century leiden , for instance , people opening their homes to services could be fined 200 guilders ( a year 's wage for a skilled tradesman ) and banned from the city . throughout this , however , personal freedom of religion existed and was one factor - along with economic reasons - in causing large immigration of religious refugees from other parts of europe .
the philadelphia dialect , which is spread throughout the delaware valley and south jersey , is part of mid-atlantic american english , and as such it is identical in many ways to the baltimore dialect . unlike the baltimore dialect , however , the philadelphia accent also shares many similarities with the new york accent . thanks to over a century of linguistics data collected by researchers at the university of pennsylvania , the philadelphia dialect under sociolinguist william labov has been one of the best-studied forms of american english .

stepper motors are a type of motor frequently used when precise rotations are required . in a stepper motor an internal rotor containing pms or a magnetically soft rotor with salient poles is controlled by a set of external magnets that are switched electronically . a stepper motor may also be thought of as a cross between a dc electric motor and a rotary solenoid . as each coil is energized in turn , the rotor aligns itself with the magnetic field produced by the energized field winding . unlike a synchronous motor , in its application , the stepper motor may not rotate continuously ; instead , it " steps " - starts and then quickly stops again - from one position to the next as field windings are energized and de-energized in sequence . depending on the sequence , the rotor may turn forwards or backwards , and it may change direction , stop , speed up or slow down arbitrarily at any time .
the earthquake was the worst to strike the sichuan area in over 30 years . following the quake , experts and the general public sought information on whether or not the earthquake could have been predicted in advance , and whether or not studying statistics related to the quake could result in better prediction of earthquakes in the future . earthquake prediction is not yet established science ; there was no consensus within the scientific community that earthquake " prediction " is possible .
dannatt criticised a remnant " cold war mentality , " with military expenditures based on retaining a capability against a direct conventional strategic threat ; he said currently only 10 % of the mod 's equipment programme budget between 2003 and 2018 was to be invested in the " land environment " - at a time when britain was engaged in land-based wars in afghanistan and iraq .
rca / jive label group ceo barry weiss left the company in march 2011 to become the new ceo of island def jam and universal republic , which were both part of universal music group . weiss had been the rca / jive label group ceo since 2008 and was head of jive records since 1991 .
red is the traditional color of warning and danger . in the middle ages , a red flag announced that the defenders of a town or castle would fight to defend it , and a red flag hoisted by a warship meant they would show no mercy to their enemy . in britain , in the early days of motoring , motor cars had to follow a man with a red flag who would warn horse-drawn vehicles , before the locomotives on highways act 1896 abolished this law . in automobile races , the red flag is raised if there is danger to the drivers . in international football , a player who has made a serious violation of the rules is shown a red penalty card and ejected from the game .
the earth receives 174,000 terawatts ( tw ) of incoming solar radiation ( insolation ) at the upper atmosphere . approximately 30 % is reflected back to space while the rest is absorbed by clouds , oceans and land masses . the spectrum of solar light at the earth 's surface is mostly spread across the visible and near-infrared ranges with a small part in the near-ultraviolet . most people around the world live in areas with insolation levels of 150 to 300 watts per square meter or 3.5 to 7.0 kwh / m2 per day .
richmond 's economy is primarily driven by law , finance , and government , with federal , state , and local governmental agencies , as well as notable legal and banking firms , located in the downtown area . the city is home to both the united states court of appeals for the fourth circuit , one of 13 united states courts of appeals , and the federal reserve bank of richmond , one of 12 federal reserve banks . dominion resources and meadwestvaco , fortune 500 companies , are headquartered in the city , with others in the metropolitan area .
most cotton in the united states , europe and australia is harvested mechanically , either by a cotton picker , a machine that removes the cotton from the boll without damaging the cotton plant , or by a cotton stripper , which strips the entire boll off the plant . cotton strippers are used in regions where it is too windy to grow picker varieties of cotton , and usually after application of a chemical defoliant or the natural defoliation that occurs after a freeze . cotton is a perennial crop in the tropics , and without defoliation or freezing , the plant will continue to grow .
in 1987 , occupations and units with the primary role of preparing for direct involvement in combat on the ground or at sea were still closed to women : infantry , armoured corps , field artillery , air-defence artillery , signals , field engineers , and naval operations . on 5 february 1987 , the minister of national defence created an office to study the impact of employing men and women in combat units . these trials were called combat-related employment of women .
the soviet success caused public controversy in the united states , and eisenhower ordered the civilian rocket and satellite project , vanguard , to move up its timetable and launch its satellite much sooner than originally planned . the december 6 , 1957 project vanguard launch failure occurred at cape canaveral air force station in florida , broadcast live in front of a us television audience . it was a monumental failure , exploding a few seconds after launch , and it became an international joke . the satellite appeared in newspapers under the names flopnik , stayputnik , kaputnik , and dudnik . in the united nations , the russian delegate offered the u.s. representative aid " under the soviet program of technical assistance to backwards nations . " only in the wake of this very public failure did von braun 's redstone team get the go-ahead to launch their jupiter-c rocket as soon as they could . in britain , the usa 's western cold war ally , the reaction was mixed : some members of the population celebrated the fact that the soviets had reached space first , while others feared the destructive potential that military uses of spacecraft might bring .
starting in 1940 ( 18 months before pearl harbor ) , the nation mobilized , giving high priority to air power . american involvement in world war ii in 1940-41 was limited to providing war material and financial support to britain , the soviet union , and the republic of china . the u.s. entered officially on 8 december 1941 following the japanese attack on pearl harbor , hawaii . japanese forces soon seized american , dutch , and british possessions across the pacific and southeast asia , except for australia , which became a main american forward base along with hawaii .
the loss of such a large portion of british america , at the time britain 's most populous overseas possession , is seen by some historians as the event defining the transition between the " first " and " second " empires , in which britain shifted its attention away from the americas to asia , the pacific and later africa . adam smith 's wealth of nations , published in 1776 , had argued that colonies were redundant , and that free trade should replace the old mercantilist policies that had characterised the first period of colonial expansion , dating back to the protectionism of spain and portugal . the growth of trade between the newly independent united states and britain after 1783 seemed to confirm smith 's view that political control was not necessary for economic success .

life with my sister madonna , a book by madonna 's brother christopher , debuted at number two on the new york times bestseller list . the book caused some friction between madonna and her brother , because of the unsolicited publication . problems also arose between madonna and ritchie , with the media reporting that they were on the verge of separation . ultimately , madonna filed for divorce from ritchie , citing irreconcilable differences , which was finalized in december 2008 . she decided to adopt from malawi . the country 's high court initially approved the adoption of chifundo " mercy " james ; however , the application was rejected because madonna was not a resident of the country . madonna appealed , and on june 12 , 2009 , the supreme court of malawi granted madonna the right to adopt mercy james . she also released celebration , her third greatest-hits album and final release with warner . it contained the new songs " celebration " and " revolver " along with 34 hits spanning her career . celebration reached number one in the uk , tying her with elvis presley as the solo act with most number one albums in the british chart history . she appeared at the 2009 mtv video music awards on september 13 , 2009 , to speak in tribute to deceased pop star michael jackson .
while the largest european-american population in montana overall is german , pockets of significant scandinavian ancestry are prevalent in some of the farming-dominated northern and eastern prairie regions , parallel to nearby regions of north dakota and minnesota . farmers of irish , scots , and english roots also settled in montana . the historically mining-oriented communities of western montana such as butte have a wider range of european-american ethnicity ; finns , eastern europeans and especially irish settlers left an indelible mark on the area , as well as people originally from british mining regions such as cornwall , devon and wales . the nearby city of helena , also founded as a mining camp , had a similar mix in addition to a small chinatown . many of montana 's historic logging communities originally attracted people of scottish , scandinavian , slavic , english and scots-irish descent .

during this period , roman soldiers seem to have been modelled after those of the etruscans to the north , who themselves seem to have copied their style of warfare from the greeks . traditionally , the introduction of the phalanx formation into the roman army is ascribed to the city 's penultimate king , servius tullius ( ruled 578 to 534 bc ) . according to livy and dionysius of halicarnassus , the front rank was composed of the wealthiest citizens , who were able to purchase the best equipment . each subsequent rank consisted of those with less wealth and poorer equipment than the one before it .
von neumann liked to eat and drink ; his wife , klara , said that he could count everything except calories . he enjoyed yiddish and " off-color " humor ( especially limericks ) . he was a non-smoker . at princeton he received complaints for regularly playing extremely loud german march music on his gramophone , which distracted those in neighbouring offices , including albert einstein , from their work . von neumann did some of his best work blazingly fast in noisy , chaotic environments , and once admonished his wife for preparing a quiet study for him to work in . he never used it , preferring the couple 's living room with its television playing loudly .
most early home computer systems developed their own 8-bit character sets containing line-drawing and game glyphs , and often filled in some or all of the control characters from 0-31 with more graphics . kaypro cp / m computers used the " upper " 128 characters for the greek alphabet . the ibm pc defined code page 437 , which replaced the control-characters with graphic symbols such as smiley faces , and mapped additional graphic characters to the upper 128 positions . operating systems such as dos supported these code pages , and manufacturers of ibm pcs supported them in hardware . digital equipment corporation developed the multinational character set ( dec-mcs ) for use in the popular vt220 terminal as one of the first extensions designed more for international languages than for block graphics . the macintosh defined mac os roman and postscript also defined a set , both of these contained both international letters and typographic punctuation marks instead of graphics , more like modern character sets .
estonia won the eurovision song contest in 2001 with the song " everybody " performed by tanel padar and dave benton . in 2002 , estonia hosted the event . maarja-liis ilus has competed for estonia on two occasions ( 1996 and 1997 ) , while eda-ines etti , koit toome and evelin samuel owe their popularity partly to the eurovision song contest . lenna kuurmaa is a very popular singer in europe [ citation needed ] , with her band vanilla ninja . " randajad " by urban symphony , was the first ever song in estonian to chart in the uk , belgium , and switzerland .
coordination strategies differ when adjacent time zones shift clocks . the european union shifts all at once , at 01 : 00 utc or 02 : 00 cet or 03 : 00 eet ; for example , eastern european time is always one hour ahead of central european time . most of north america shifts at 02 : 00 local time , so its zones do not shift at the same time ; for example , mountain time is temporarily ( for one hour ) zero hours ahead of pacific time , instead of one hour ahead , in the autumn and two hours , instead of one , ahead of pacific time in the spring . in the past , australian districts went even further and did not always agree on start and end dates ; for example , in 2008 most dst-observing areas shifted clocks forward on october 5 but western australia shifted on october 26 . in some cases only part of a country shifts ; for example , in the us , hawaii and most of arizona do not observe dst .
in september 1975 , gaddafi purged the army , arresting around 200 senior officers , and in october he founded the clandestine office for the security of the revolution . in 1976 , student demonstrations broke out in tripoli and benghazi , and were attacked by police and gaddafist students . the rcc responded with mass arrests , and introduced compulsory national service for young people . dissent also arose from conservative clerics and the muslim brotherhood , who were persecuted as anti-revolutionary . in january 1977 , two dissenting students and a number of army officers were publicly hanged ; amnesty international condemned it as the first time in gaddafist libya that dissenters had been executed for purely political crimes .
according to the latest international monetary fund estimates , its per capita gdp ( adjusted for purchasing power ) at $ 30,769 is just above the average of the european union . [ citation needed ] cyprus has been sought as a base for several offshore businesses for its low tax rates . tourism , financial services and shipping are significant parts of the economy . economic policy of the cyprus government has focused on meeting the criteria for admission to the european union . the cypriot government adopted the euro as the national currency on 1 january 2008 .
at about this time the surrounding areas experienced recurring fragmentation and reincorporations among a number of feudal secular and ecclesiastical lordships , a common process in the holy roman empire . alsace experienced great prosperity during the 12th and 13th centuries under hohenstaufen emperors . frederick i set up alsace as a province ( a procuratio , not a provincia ) to be ruled by ministeriales , a non-noble class of civil servants . the idea was that such men would be more tractable and less likely to alienate the fief from the crown out of their own greed . the province had a single provincial court ( landgericht ) and a central administration with its seat at hagenau . frederick ii designated the bishop of strasbourg to administer alsace , but the authority of the bishop was challenged by count rudolf of habsburg , who received his rights from frederick ii 's son conrad iv . strasbourg began to grow to become the most populous and commercially important town in the region . in 1262 , after a long struggle with the ruling bishops , its citizens gained the status of free imperial city . a stop on the paris-vienna-orient trade route , as well as a port on the rhine route linking southern germany and switzerland to the netherlands , england and scandinavia , it became the political and economic center of the region . cities such as colmar and hagenau also began to grow in economic importance and gained a kind of autonomy within the " decapole " or " dekapolis , " a federation of ten free towns .
another landmark is the old centre and the canal structure in the inner city . the oudegracht is a curved canal , partly following the ancient main branch of the rhine . it is lined with the unique wharf-basement structures that create a two-level street along the canals . the inner city has largely retained its medieval structure , and the moat ringing the old town is largely intact . because of the role of utrecht as a fortified city , construction outside the medieval centre and its city walls was restricted until the 19th century . surrounding the medieval core there is a ring of late 19th- and early 20th-century neighbourhoods , with newer neighbourhoods positioned farther out . the eastern part of utrecht remains fairly open . the dutch water line , moved east of the city in the early 19th century required open lines of fire , thus prohibiting all permanent constructions until the middle of the 20th century on the east side of the city .
on december 30 , 1922 , with the creation of the soviet union , russia became one of six republics within the federation of the union of soviet socialist republics . the final soviet name for the republic , the russian soviet federative socialist republic , was adopted in the soviet constitution of 1936 . by that time , soviet russia had gained roughly the same borders of the old tsardom of russia before the great northern war of 1700 .
the roman empire came to dominate the entire mediterranean basin in a vast empire based on roman law and roman legions . it promoted trade , tolerance , and greek culture . by 300 ad the roman empire was divided into the western roman empire based in rome , and the eastern roman empire based in constantinople . the attacks of the germanic peoples of northern europe led to the fall of the western roman empire in ad 476 , a date which traditionally marks the end of the classical period and the start of the middle ages .
city and guilds college was founded in 1876 from a meeting of 16 of the city of london 's livery companies for the advancement of technical education ( cgli ) , which aimed to improve the training of craftsmen , technicians , technologists , and engineers . the two main objectives were to create a central institution in london and to conduct a system of qualifying examinations in technical subjects . faced with their continuing inability to find a substantial site , the companies were eventually persuaded by the secretary of the science and art department , general sir john donnelly ( who was also a royal engineer ) to found their institution on the eighty-seven acre ( 350,000 m ² ) site at south kensington bought by the 1851 exhibition commissioners ( for gbp 342,500 ) for ' purposes of art and science ' in perpetuity . the latter two colleges were incorporated by royal charter into the imperial college of science and technology and the cgli central technical college was renamed the city and guilds college in 1907 , but not incorporated into imperial college until 1910 .
in the general election , kerry was initially favored to defeat the republican candidate , former state representative paul w. cronin , and conservative democrat roger p. durkin , who ran as an independent . a week after the primary , one poll put kerry 26-points ahead of cronin . his campaign called for a national health insurance system , discounted prescription drugs for the unemployed , a jobs programme to clean up the merrimack river and rent controls in lowell and lawrence . a major obstacle , however , was the district 's leading newspaper , the conservative the sun . the paper editorialized against him . it also ran critical news stories about his out-of-state contributions and his " carpetbagging , " because he had only moved into the district in april . subsequently released " watergate " oval office tape recordings of the nixon white house showed that defeating kerry 's candidacy had attracted the personal attention of president nixon . kerry himself asserts that nixon sent operatives to lowell to help derail his campaign .
the treaty of hubertusburg , between austria , prussia , and saxony , was signed on february 15 , 1763 , at a hunting lodge between dresden and leipzig . negotiations had started there on december 31 , 1762 . frederick , who had considered ceding east prussia to russia if peter iii helped him secure saxony , finally insisted on excluding russia ( in fact , no longer a belligerent ) from the negotiations . at the same time , he refused to evacuate saxony until its elector had renounced any claim to reparation . the austrians wanted at least to retain glatz , which they had in fact reconquered , but frederick would not allow it . the treaty simply restored the status quo of 1748 , with silesia and glatz reverting to frederick and saxony to its own elector . the only concession that prussia made to austria was to consent to the election of archduke joseph as holy roman emperor .
the second digimon series is direct continuation of the first one , and began airing on april 2 , 2000 . three years later , with most of the original digidestined now in high school at age fourteen , the digital world was supposedly secure and peaceful . however , a new evil has appeared in the form of the digimon emperor ( digimon kaiser ) who as opposed to previous enemies is a human just like the digidestined . the digimon emperor has been enslaving digimon with dark rings and control spires and has somehow made regular digivolution impossible . however , five set digi-eggs with engraved emblems had been appointed to three new digidestined along with t.k. and kari , two of the digidestined from the previous series . this new evolutionary process , dubbed armor digivolution helps the new digidestined to defeat evil lurking in the digital world . eventually , the digidestined defeat the digimon emperor , more commonly known as ken ichijouji on earth , only with the great sacrifice of ken 's own digimon , wormmon . just when things were thought to be settled , new digimon enemies made from the deactivated control spires start to appear and cause trouble in the digital world . to atone for his past mistakes , ken joins the digidestined , being a digidestined himself , with his partner wormmon revived to fight against them . they soon save countries including france and australia from control spires and defeat malomyotismon ( belialvamdemon ) , the digivolved form of myotismon ( vamdemon ) from the previous series . they stop the evil from destroying the two worlds , and at the end , every person on earth gains their own digimon partner .
agricultural production on the island is difficult given the dry and rocky terrain , but the early settlers managed to produce vegetables , cotton , pineapples , salt , bananas and also fishing . sweet potato is also grown in patches . the islanders developed commerce through the port of gustavia . duty-free port attractions , retail trade , high-end tourism ( mostly from north america ) and its luxury hotels and villas have increased the island 's prosperity , reflected in the high standard of living of its citizens .
the economic structure of the empire was defined by its geopolitical structure . the ottoman empire stood between the west and the east , thus blocking the land route eastward and forcing spanish and portuguese navigators to set sail in search of a new route to the orient . the empire controlled the spice route that marco polo once used . when vasco da gama bypassed ottoman controlled routes and established direct trade links with india in 1498 , and christopher columbus first journeyed to the bahamas in 1492 , the ottoman empire was at its zenith .
synnecrosis is a rare type of symbiosis in which the interaction between species is detrimental to both organisms involved . it is a short-lived condition , as the interaction eventually causes death . because of this , evolution selects against synnecrosis and it is uncommon in nature . an example of this is the relationship between some species of bees and victims of the bee sting . species of bees who die after stinging their prey inflict pain on themselves ( albeit to protect the hive ) as well as on the victim . this term is rarely used .
in 1897 , frank shuman , a u.s. inventor , engineer and solar energy pioneer built a small demonstration solar engine that worked by reflecting solar energy onto square boxes filled with ether , which has a lower boiling point than water , and were fitted internally with black pipes which in turn powered a steam engine . in 1908 shuman formed the sun power company with the intent of building larger solar power plants . he , along with his technical advisor a.s.e. ackermann and british physicist sir charles vernon boys , developed an improved system using mirrors to reflect solar energy upon collector boxes , increasing heating capacity to the extent that water could now be used instead of ether . shuman then constructed a full-scale steam engine powered by low-pressure water , enabling him to patent the entire solar engine system by 1912 .
during the later part of the malla era , kathmandu valley comprised four fortified cities : kantipur , lalitpur , bhaktapur , and kirtipur . these served as the capitals of the malla confederation of nepal . these states competed with each other in the arts , architecture , aesthetics , and trade , resulting in tremendous development . the kings of this period directly influenced or involved themselves in the construction of public buildings , squares , and temples , as well as the development of water spouts , the institutionalization of trusts ( called guthis ) , the codification of laws , the writing of dramas , and the performance of plays in city squares . evidence of an influx of ideas from india , tibet , china , persia , and europe among other places can be found in a stone inscription from the time of king pratap malla . books have been found from this era that describe their tantric tradition ( e.g. tantrakhyan ) , medicine ( e.g. haramekhala ) , religion ( e.g. mooldevshashidev ) , law , morals , and history . amarkosh , a sanskrit-nepal bhasa dictionary from 1381 ad , was also found . architecturally notable buildings from this era include kathmandu durbar square , patan durbar square , bhaktapur durbar square , the former durbar of kirtipur , nyatapola , kumbheshwar , the krishna temple , and others .
a collector of film memorabilia , spielberg purchased a balsa rosebud sled from citizen kane ( 1941 ) in 1982 . he bought orson welles 's own directorial copy of the script for the radio broadcast the war of the worlds ( 1938 ) in 1994 . spielberg has purchased academy award statuettes being sold on the open market and donated them to the academy of motion picture arts and sciences , to prevent their further commercial exploitation . his donations include the oscars that bette davis received for dangerous ( 1935 ) and jezebel ( 1938 ) , and clark gable 's oscar for it happened one night ( 1934 ) .
in jurisdictions using a common law system , the doctrine of stare decisis applies , whereby the principles applied by the supreme court in its decisions are binding upon all lower courts ; this is intended to apply a uniform interpretation and implementation of the law . in civil law jurisdictions the doctrine of stare decisis is not generally considered to apply , so the decisions of the supreme court are not necessarily binding beyond the immediate case before it ; however , in practice the decisions of the supreme court usually provide a very strong precedent , or jurisprudence constante , for both itself and all lower courts .

to define light source color properties , the lighting industry predominantly relies on two metrics , correlated color temperature ( cct ) , commonly used as an indication of the apparent " warmth " or " coolness " of the light emitted by a source , and color rendering index ( cri ) , an indication of the light source 's ability to make objects appear natural .
the coastline of norfolk island consists , to varying degrees , of cliff faces . a downward slope exists towards slaughter bay and emily bay , the site of the original colonial settlement of kingston . there are no safe harbour facilities on norfolk island , with loading jetties existing at kingston and cascade bay . all goods not domestically produced are brought in by ship , usually to cascade bay . emily bay , protected from the pacific ocean by a small coral reef , is the only safe area for recreational swimming , although surfing waves can be found at anson and ball bays .
international pressure led to a ceasefire , and by then 37 % of the island had been taken over by the turks and 180,000 greek cypriots had been evicted from their homes in the north . at the same time , around 50,000 turkish cypriots moved to the areas under the control of the turkish forces and settled in the properties of the displaced greek cypriots . among a variety of sanctions against turkey , in mid-1975 the us congress imposed an arms embargo on turkey for using american-supplied equipment during the turkish invasion of cyprus in 1974 . there are 1,534 greek cypriots and 502 turkish cypriots missing as a result of the fighting .
people of all ages and social statuses were depicted in the art of the hellenistic age . artists such as peiraikos chose mundane and lower class subjects for his paintings . according to pliny , " he painted barbers ' shops , cobblers ' stalls , asses , eatables and similar subjects , earning for himself the name of rhyparographos [ painter of dirt / low things ] . in these subjects he could give consummate pleasure , selling them for more than other artists received for their large pictures " ( natural history , book xxxv.112 ) . even barbarians , such as the galatians , were depicted in heroic form , prefiguring the artistic theme of the noble savage . the image of alexander the great was also an important artistic theme , and all of the diadochi had themselves depicted imitating alexander 's youthful look . a number of the best-known works of greek sculpture belong to the hellenistic period , including laocoon and his sons , venus de milo , and the winged victory of samothrace .

the redevelopment of the city was planned by sir patrick abercrombie in his 1943 plan for plymouth whilst simultaneously working on the reconstruction plan for london . between 1951 and 1957 over 1000 homes were completed every year mostly using innovative prefabricated systems of just three main types ; by 1964 over 20,000 new homes had been built transforming the dense overcrowded and unsanitary slums of the pre-war city into a low density , dispersed suburbia . most of the city centre shops had been destroyed and those that remained were cleared to enable a zoned reconstruction according to his plan . in 1962 the modernist high rise of the civic centre was constructed , an architecturally significant example of mid twentieth century civic slab-and-tower set piece allowed to fall into disrepair by its owner plymouth city council but recently grade ii listed by english heritage to prevent its demolition .
large numbers of bolivian highland peasants retained indigenous language , culture , customs , and communal organization throughout the spanish conquest and the post-independence period . they mobilized to resist various attempts at the dissolution of communal landholdings and used legal recognition of " empowered caciques " to further communal organization . indigenous revolts took place frequently until 1953 . while the national revolutionary movement government begun in 1952 discouraged self-identification as indigenous ( reclassifying rural people as campesinos , or peasants ) , renewed ethnic and class militancy re-emerged in the katarista movement beginning in the 1970s . lowland indigenous peoples , mostly in the east , entered national politics through the 1990 march for territory and dignity organized by the cidob confederation . that march successfully pressured the national government to sign the ilo convention 169 and to begin the still-ongoing process of recognizing and titling indigenous territories . the 1994 law of popular participation granted " grassroots territorial organizations " that are recognized by the state certain rights to govern local areas .
there is no clear consensus on the nature or even the existence of god . the abrahamic conceptions of god include the monotheistic definition of god in judaism , the trinitarian view of christians , and the islamic concept of god . the dharmic religions differ in their view of the divine : views of god in hinduism vary by region , sect , and caste , ranging from monotheistic to polytheistic to atheistic . divinity was recognized by the historical buddha , particularly sakra and brahma . however , other sentient beings , including gods , can at best only play a supportive role in one 's personal path to salvation . conceptions of god in the latter developments of the mahayana tradition give a more prominent place to notions of the divine .

the city is drained by three rivers ; the west , mill , and quinnipiac , named in order from west to east . the west river discharges into west haven harbor , while the mill and quinnipiac rivers discharge into new haven harbor . both harbors are embayments of long island sound . in addition , several smaller streams flow through the city 's neighborhoods , including wintergreen brook , the beaver ponds outlet , wilmot brook , belden brook , and prospect creek . not all of these small streams have continuous flow year-round .
the degree to which adolescents are perceived as autonomous beings varies widely by culture , as do the behaviors that represent this emerging autonomy . psychologists have identified three main types of autonomy : emotional independence , behavioral autonomy , and cognitive autonomy . emotional autonomy is defined in terms of an adolescent 's relationships with others , and often includes the development of more mature emotional connections with adults and peers . behavioral autonomy encompasses an adolescent 's developing ability to regulate his or her own behavior , to act on personal decisions , and to self-govern . cultural differences are especially visible in this category because it concerns issues of dating , social time with peers , and time-management decisions . cognitive autonomy describes the capacity for an adolescent to partake in processes of independent reasoning and decision-making without excessive reliance on social validation . converging influences from adolescent cognitive development , expanding social relationships , an increasingly adultlike appearance , and the acceptance of more rights and responsibilities enhance feelings of autonomy for adolescents . proper development of autonomy has been tied to good mental health , high self-esteem , self-motivated tendencies , positive self-concepts , and self-initiating and regulating behaviors . furthermore , it has been found that adolescents ' mental health is best when their feelings about autonomy match closely with those of their parents .
by 1847 , the couple had found the palace too small for court life and their growing family , and consequently the new wing , designed by edward blore , was built by thomas cubitt , enclosing the central quadrangle . the large east front , facing the mall , is today the " public face " of buckingham palace , and contains the balcony from which the royal family acknowledge the crowds on momentous occasions and after the annual trooping the colour . the ballroom wing and a further suite of state rooms were also built in this period , designed by nash 's student sir james pennethorne .
in the resulting battle of pusan perimeter ( august-september 1950 ) , the u.s. army withstood kpa attacks meant to capture the city at the naktong bulge , p 'ohang-dong , and taegu . the united states air force ( usaf ) interrupted kpa logistics with 40 daily ground support sorties that destroyed 32 bridges , halting most daytime road and rail traffic . kpa forces were forced to hide in tunnels by day and move only at night . to deny materiel to the kpa , the usaf destroyed logistics depots , petroleum refineries , and harbors , while the u.s. navy air forces attacked transport hubs . consequently , the over-extended kpa could not be supplied throughout the south . on 27 august , 67th fighter squadron aircraft mistakenly attacked facilities in chinese territory and the soviet union called the un security council 's attention to china 's complaint about the incident . the us proposed that a commission of india and sweden determine what the us should pay in compensation but the soviets vetoed the us proposal .
sunlight may be stored as gravitational potential energy after it strikes the earth , as ( for example ) water evaporates from oceans and is deposited upon mountains ( where , after being released at a hydroelectric dam , it can be used to drive turbines or generators to produce electricity ) . sunlight also drives many weather phenomena , save those generated by volcanic events . an example of a solar-mediated weather event is a hurricane , which occurs when large unstable areas of warm ocean , heated over months , give up some of their thermal energy suddenly to power a few days of violent air movement .
chopin 's relations with sand were soured in 1846 by problems involving her daughter solange and solange 's fiance , the young fortune-hunting sculptor auguste clesinger . the composer frequently took solange 's side in quarrels with her mother ; he also faced jealousy from sand 's son maurice . chopin was utterly indifferent to sand 's radical political pursuits , while sand looked on his society friends with disdain . as the composer 's illness progressed , sand had become less of a lover and more of a nurse to chopin , whom she called her " third child . " in letters to third parties , she vented her impatience , referring to him as a " child , " a " little angel , " a " sufferer " and a " beloved little corpse . " in 1847 sand published her novel lucrezia floriani , whose main characters - a rich actress and a prince in weak health - could be interpreted as sand and chopin ; the story was uncomplimentary to chopin , who could not have missed the allusions as he helped sand correct the printer 's galleys . in 1847 he did not visit nohant , and he quietly ended their ten-year relationship following an angry correspondence which , in sand 's words , made " a strange conclusion to nine years of exclusive friendship . " the two would never meet again .
in the 2004 democratic presidential primaries , john kerry defeated several democratic rivals , including sen. john edwards ( d-north carolina . ) , former vermont governor howard dean and retired army general wesley clark . his victory in the iowa caucuses is widely believed to be the tipping point where kerry revived his sagging campaign in new hampshire and the february 3 , 2004 , primary states like arizona , south carolina and new mexico . kerry then went on to win landslide victories in nevada and wisconsin . kerry thus won the democratic nomination to run for president of the united states against incumbent george w. bush . on july 6 , 2004 , he announced his selection of john edwards as his running mate . democratic strategist bob shrum , who was kerry 's 2004 campaign adviser , wrote an article in time magazine claiming that after the election , kerry had said that he wished he 'd never picked edwards , and that the two have since stopped speaking to each other . in a subsequent appearance on abc 's this week , kerry refused to respond to shrum 's allegation , calling it a " ridiculous waste of time . "

in 1994 , over a hundred intrusions were made by unidentified crackers into the rome laboratory , the us air force 's main command and research facility . using trojan horses , hackers were able to obtain unrestricted access to rome 's networking systems and remove traces of their activities . the intruders were able to obtain classified files , such as air tasking order systems data and furthermore able to penetrate connected networks of national aeronautics and space administration 's goddard space flight center , wright-patterson air force base , some defense contractors , and other private sector organizations , by posing as a trusted rome center user .
royal assent is the method by which a country 's constitutional monarch ( possibly through a delegated official ) formally approves an act of that nation 's parliament , thus making it a law or letting it be promulgated as law . in the vast majority of contemporary monarchies , this act is considered to be little more than a formality ; even in those nations which still permit their ruler to withhold the royal assent ( such as the united kingdom , norway , and liechtenstein ) , the monarch almost never does so , save in a dire political emergency or upon the advice of their government . while the power to withhold royal assent was once exercised often in european monarchies , it is exceedingly rare in the modern , democratic political atmosphere that has developed there since the 18th century .
jewish law does not prohibit keeping dogs and other pets . jewish law requires jews to feed dogs ( and other animals that they own ) before themselves , and make arrangements for feeding them before obtaining them . in christianity , dogs represent faithfulness .
the hellenistic period saw the rise of new comedy , the only few surviving representative texts being those of menander ( born 342 / 1 bce ) . only one play , dyskolos , survives in its entirety . the plots of this new hellenistic comedy of manners were more domestic and formulaic , stereotypical low born characters such as slaves became more important , the language was colloquial and major motifs included escapism , marriage , romance and luck ( tyche ) . though no hellenistic tragedy remains intact , they were still widely produced during the period , yet it seems that there was no major breakthrough in style , remaining within the classical model . the supplementum hellenisticum , a modern collection of extant fragments , contains the fragments of 150 authors .
in june 1990 , the times ceased its policy of using courtesy titles ( " mr , " " mrs , " or " miss " prefixes ) for living persons before full names on first reference , but it continues to use them before surnames on subsequent references . the more formal style is now confined to the " court and social " page , though " ms " is now acceptable in that section , as well as before surnames in news sections .
it is generally considered that the pacific war began on 7 / 8 december 1941 , on which date japan invaded thailand and attacked the british possessions of malaya , singapore , and hong kong as well as the united states military bases in hawaii , wake island , guam and the philippines . some historians contend that the conflict in asia can be dated back to 7 july 1937 with the beginning of the second sino-japanese war between the empire of japan and the republic of china , or possibly 19 september 1931 , beginning with the japanese invasion of manchuria . however , it is more widely accepted that the pacific war itself started in early december 1941 , with the sino-japanese war then becoming part of it as a theater of the greater world war ii .

the united states air force ( usaf ) is the aerial warfare service branch of the united states armed forces and one of the seven american uniformed services . initially part of the united states army , the usaf was formed as a separate branch of the military on 18 september 1947 under the national security act of 1947 . it is the most recent branch of the u.s. military to be formed , and is the largest and one of the world 's most technologically advanced air forces . the usaf articulates its core functions as nuclear deterrence operations , special operations , air superiority , global integrated isr , space superiority , command and control , cyberspace superiority , personnel recovery , global precision attack , building partnerships , rapid global mobility and agile combat support .
between 1996 and 2004 , the population of the city increased by 4.9 per cent - the tenth biggest increase in england . in 2005 the government statistics stated that southampton was the third most densely populated city in the country after london and portsmouth respectively . hampshire county council expects the city 's population to grow by around a further two per cent between 2006 and 2013 , adding around another 4,200 to the total number of residents . the highest increases are expected among the elderly .
the economist f. a. hayek analyzed how the rule of law might be beneficial to the free market . hayek proposed that under the rule of law individuals would be able to make wise investments and future plans with some confidence in a successful return on investment when he stated : " under the rule of law the government is prevented from stultifying individual efforts by ad hoc action . within the known rules of the game the individual is free to pursue his personal ends and desires , certain that the powers of government will not be used deliberately to frustrate his efforts . "
both locke and rousseau developed social contract theories in two treatises of government and discourse on inequality , respectively . while quite different works , locke , hobbes , and rousseau agreed that a social contract , in which the government 's authority lies in the consent of the governed , is necessary for man to live in civil society . locke defines the state of nature as a condition in which humans are rational and follow natural law ; in which all men are born equal and with the right to life , liberty and property . however , when one citizen breaks the law of nature , both the transgressor and the victim enter into a state of war , from which it is virtually impossible to break free . therefore , locke said that individuals enter into civil society to protect their natural rights via an " unbiased judge " or common authority , such as courts , to appeal to . contrastingly , rousseau 's conception relies on the supposition that " civil man " is corrupted , while " natural man " has no want he cannot fulfill himself . natural man is only taken out of the state of nature when the inequality associated with private property is established . rousseau said that people join into civil society via the social contract to achieve unity while preserving individual freedom . this is embodied in the sovereignty of the general will , the moral and collective legislative body constituted by citizens .
since the latewood of a growth ring is usually darker in color than the earlywood , this fact may be used in judging the density , and therefore the hardness and strength of the material . this is particularly the case with coniferous woods . in ring-porous woods the vessels of the early wood not infrequently appear on a finished surface as darker than the denser latewood , though on cross sections of heartwood the reverse is commonly true . except in the manner just stated the color of wood is no indication of strength .
the college of arts and letters was established as the university 's first college in 1842 with the first degrees given in 1849 . the university 's first academic curriculum was modeled after the jesuit ratio studiorum from saint louis university . today the college , housed in o 'shaughnessy hall , includes 20 departments in the areas of fine arts , humanities , and social sciences , and awards bachelor of arts ( b.a. ) degrees in 33 majors , making it the largest of the university 's colleges . there are around 2,500 undergraduates and 750 graduates enrolled in the college .
switzerland 's ecosystems can be particularly fragile , because the many delicate valleys separated by high mountains often form unique ecologies . the mountainous regions themselves are also vulnerable , with a rich range of plants not found at other altitudes , and experience some pressure from visitors and grazing . the climatic , geological and topographical conditions of the alpine region make for a very fragile ecosystem that is particularly sensitive to climate change . nevertheless , according to the 2014 environmental performance index , switzerland ranks first among 132 nations in safeguarding the environment , due to its high scores on environmental public health , its heavy reliance on renewable sources of energy ( hydropower and geothermal energy ) , and its control of greenhouse gas emissions .
strict separation of powers did not operate in the united kingdom , the political structure of which served in most instances [ citation needed ] as a model for the government created by the u.s. constitution . [ citation needed ] under the uk westminster system , based on parliamentary sovereignty and responsible government , parliament ( consisting of the sovereign ( king-in-parliament ) , house of lords and house of commons ) was the supreme lawmaking authority . the executive branch acted in the name of the king ( " his majesty 's government " ) , as did the judiciary . the king 's ministers were in most cases members of one of the two houses of parliament , and the government needed to sustain the support of a majority in the house of commons . one minister , the lord chancellor , was at the same time the sole judge in the court of chancery and the presiding officer in the house of lords . therefore , it may be seen that the three branches of british government often violated the strict principle of separation of powers , even though there were many occasions when the different branches of the government disagreed with each other . some u.s. states did not observe a strict separation of powers in the 18th century . in new jersey , the governor also functioned as a member of the state 's highest court and as the presiding officer of one house of the new jersey legislature . the president of delaware was a member of the court of appeals ; the presiding officers of the two houses of the state legislature also served in the executive department as vice presidents . in both delaware and pennsylvania , members of the executive council served at the same time as judges . on the other hand , many southern states explicitly required separation of powers . maryland , virginia , north carolina and georgia all kept the branches of government " separate and distinct . "
nunzia rondanini stated , " through its aesthetic dimension architecture goes beyond the functional aspects that it has in common with other human sciences . through its own particular way of expressing values , architecture can stimulate and influence social life without presuming that , in and of itself , it will promote social development . '
during the 1930s , the first two motorways were built across the land , the a4 motorway as an important east-west connection in central germany and the main link between berlin and south-west germany , and the a9 motorway as the main north-south route in eastern germany , connecting berlin with munich . the a4 runs from frankfurt in hesse via eisenach , gotha , erfurt , weimar , jena and gera to dresden in saxony , connecting thuringia 's most important cities . at hermsdorf junction it is connected with the a9 . both highways were widened from four to six lanes ( three each way ) after 1990 , including some extensive re-routing in the eisenach and jena areas . furthermore , three new motorways were built during the 1990s and 2000s . the a71 crosses the land in southwest-northeast direction , connecting wurzburg in bavaria via meiningen , suhl , ilmenau , arnstadt , erfurt and sommerda with sangerhausen and halle in saxony-anhalt . the crossing of the thuringian forest by the a71 has been one of germany 's most expensive motorway segments with various tunnels ( including germany 's longest road tunnel , the rennsteig tunnel ) and large bridges . the a73 starts at the a71 south of erfurt in suhl and runs south towards nuremberg in bavaria . the a38 is another west-east connection in the north of thuringia running from gottingen in lower saxony via heiligenstadt and nordhausen to leipzig in saxony . furthermore , there is a dense network of federal highways complementing the motorway network . the upgrading of federal highways is prioritised in the federal trunk road programme 2015 ( bundesverkehrswegeplan 2015 ) . envisaged projects include upgrades of the b247 from gotha to leinefelde to improve muhlhausen 's connection to the national road network , the b19 from eisenach to meiningen to improve access to bad salzungen and schmalkalden , and the b88 and b281 for strengthening the saalfeld / rudolstadt region .
the medical treatment of infectious diseases falls into the medical field of infectious disease and in some cases the study of propagation pertains to the field of epidemiology . generally , infections are initially diagnosed by primary care physicians or internal medicine specialists . for example , an " uncomplicated " pneumonia will generally be treated by the internist or the pulmonologist ( lung physician ) . the work of the infectious diseases specialist therefore entails working with both patients and general practitioners , as well as laboratory scientists , immunologists , bacteriologists and other specialists .
of numerous relationships between male slaveholders , overseers , or master 's sons and women slaves , the most notable is likely that of president thomas jefferson with his slave sally hemings . as noted in the 2012 collaborative smithsonian-monticello exhibit , slavery at monticello : the paradox of liberty , jefferson , then a widower , took hemings as his concubine for nearly 40 years . they had six children of record ; four hemings children survived into adulthood , and he freed them all , among the very few slaves he freed . two were allowed to " escape " to the north in 1822 , and two were granted freedom by his will upon his death in 1826 . seven-eighths white by ancestry , all four of his hemings children moved to northern states as adults ; three of the four entered the white community , and all their descendants identified as white . of the descendants of madison hemings , who continued to identify as black , some in future generations eventually identified as white and " married out , " while others continued to identify as african american . it was socially advantageous for the hemings children to identify as white , in keeping with their appearance and the majority proportion of their ancestry . although born into slavery , the hemings children were legally white under virginia law of the time .
the early currency of the united states did not exhibit faces of presidents , as is the custom now ; although today , by law , only the portrait of a deceased individual may appear on united states currency . in fact , the newly formed government was against having portraits of leaders on the currency , a practice compared to the policies of european monarchs . the currency as we know it today did not get the faces they currently have until after the early 20th century ; before that " heads " side of coinage used profile faces and striding , seated , and standing figures from greek and roman mythology and composite native americans . the last coins to be converted to profiles of historic americans were the dime ( 1946 ) and the dollar ( 1971 ) .
schwarzenegger 's endorsement in the republican primary of the 2008 u.s. presidential election was highly sought ; despite being good friends with candidates rudy giuliani and senator john mccain , schwarzenegger remained neutral throughout 2007 and early 2008 . giuliani dropped out of the presidential race on january 30 , 2008 , largely because of a poor showing in florida , and endorsed mccain . later that night , schwarzenegger was in the audience at a republican debate at the ronald reagan presidential library in california . the following day , he endorsed mccain , joking , " it 's rudy 's fault ! " ( in reference to his friendships with both candidates and that he could not make up his mind ) . schwarzenegger 's endorsement was thought to be a boost for senator mccain 's campaign ; both spoke about their concerns for the environment and economy .
when world war ii started in 1939 , it divided the world into two alliances - the allies ( the united kingdom and france at first in europe , china in asia since 1937 , followed in 1941 by the soviet union , the united states ) ; and the axis powers consisting of germany , italy and japan . [ nb 1 ] during world war ii , the united states , united kingdom , and soviet union controlled allied policy and emerged as the " big three . " the republic of china and the big three were referred as a " trusteeship of the powerful " and were recognized as the allied " big four " in declaration by united nations in 1942 . these four countries were referred as the " four policemen " of the allies and considered as the primary victors of world war ii . the importance of france was acknowledged by their inclusion , along with the other four , in the group of countries allotted permanent seats in the united nations security council .
the gyromagnetic ratio γ is the constant of proportionality between the frequency ν of nuclear magnetic resonance ( or electron paramagnetic resonance for electrons ) and the applied magnetic field b : ν = γb . it is difficult to measure gyromagnetic ratios precisely because of the difficulties in precisely measuring b , but the value for protons in water at 7002298150000000000 ♠ 25 ° c is known to better than one part per million . the protons are said to be " shielded " from the applied magnetic field by the electrons in the water molecule , the same effect that gives rise to chemical shift in nmr spectroscopy , and this is indicated by a prime on the symbol for the gyromagnetic ratio , γ ′ p . the gyromagnetic ratio is related to the shielded proton magnetic moment μ ′ p , the spin number i ( i = 1 ⁄ 2 for protons ) and the reduced planck constant .
in 1937 , the empire of japan started a full-scale invasion of china after invading manchuria in 1931 , beginning the second sino-japanese war ( often considered a theatre of world war ii ) . their troops occupied nanjing in december and carried out the systematic and brutal nanking massacre ( the " rape of nanking " ) . even children , the elderly , and nuns are reported to have suffered at the hands of the imperial japanese army . the total death toll , including estimates made by the international military tribunal for the far east and the nanjing war crimes tribunal , was between 300,000 and 350,000 . the city itself was also severely damaged during the massacre . the nanjing massacre memorial hall was built in 1985 to commemorate this event .
a new index was released on december 18 , 2008 . this so-called " statistical update " covered the period up to 2006 and was published without an accompanying human development report . the update is relevant due to newly released estimates of purchasing power parities ( ppp ) , implying substantial adjustments for many countries , resulting in changes in hdi values and , in many cases , hdi ranks .
during fiscal year 2007 , $ 537.5 million was received in total research support , including $ 444 million in federal obligations . the university has over 150 national institutes of health funded inventions , with many of them licensed to private companies . governmental agencies and non-profit foundations such as the nih , united states department of defense , national science foundation , and nasa provide the majority of research grant funding , with washington university being one of the top recipients in nih grants from year-to-year . nearly 80 % of nih grants to institutions in the state of missouri went to washington university alone in 2007 . washington university and its medical school play a large part in the human genome project , where it contributes approximately 25 % of the finished sequence . the genome sequencing center has decoded the genome of many animals , plants , and cellular organisms , including the platypus , chimpanzee , cat , and corn .
during the 1800s christian missionaries from great britain and the united states followed traders to the hawaiian islands . long-termly , the anglo-saxon presence negatively impacted the level of regard hawaiian royal women held for their own indigenous looks . for centuries prior the arrival of christians , first nation hawaiian aesthetics , such as dark skin and ample bodies , had been considered signs of nobility . no matter how much they adapted their mannerisms to western standard , some of the anglo-saxon missionaries were relentless in referring to the indigenous women as " hawaiian squaws . " by the last half of the 19th century , some hawaiian women began marrying european men who found them exotic . the men , however , selected hawaiian women who were thinner and paler in complexion .
dell assembled computers for the emea market at the limerick facility in the republic of ireland , and once employed about 4,500 people in that country . dell began manufacturing in limerick in 1991 and went on to become ireland 's largest exporter of goods and its second-largest company and foreign investor . on january 8 , 2009 , dell announced that it would move all dell manufacturing in limerick to dell 's new plant in the polish city of łodz by january 2010 . european union officials said they would investigate a € 52.7million aid package the polish government used to attract dell away from ireland . european manufacturing facility 1 ( emf1 , opened in 1990 ) and emf3 form part of the raheen industrial estate near limerick . emf2 ( previously a wang facility , later occupied by flextronics , situated in castletroy ) closed in 2002 , [ citation needed ] and dell inc. has consolidated production into emf3 ( emf1 now [ when ? ] contains only offices ) . subsidies from the polish government did keep dell for a long time . after ending assembly in the limerick plant the cherrywood technology campus in dublin was the largest dell office in the republic with over 1200 people in sales ( mainly uk & ireland ) , support ( enterprise support for emea ) and research and development for cloud computing , but no more manufacturing except dell 's alienware subsidiary , which manufactures pcs in an athlone , ireland plant . whether this facility will remain in ireland is not certain . construction of emf4 in łodz , poland has started [ update ] : dell started production there in autumn 2007 .
the relationship between ethnic greek identity and greek orthodox religion continued after the creation of the modern greek state in 1830 . according to the second article of the first greek constitution of 1822 , a greek was defined as any christian resident of the kingdom of greece , a clause removed by 1840 . a century later , when the treaty of lausanne was signed between greece and turkey in 1923 , the two countries agreed to use religion as the determinant for ethnic identity for the purposes of population exchange , although most of the greeks displaced ( over a million of the total 1.5 million ) had already been driven out by the time the agreement was signed . [ note 1 ] the greek genocide , in particular the harsh removal of pontian greeks from the southern shore area of the black sea , contemporaneous with and following the failed greek asia minor campaign , was part of this process of turkification of the ottoman empire and the placement of its economy and trade , then largely in greek hands under ethnic turkish control .
the beer houses tended to avoid the traditional pub names like the crown , the red lion , the royal oak etc. and , if they did not simply name their place smith 's beer house , they would apply topical pub names in an effort to reflect the mood of the times .
new york city 's most important economic sector lies in its role as the headquarters for the u.s.financial industry , metonymously known as wall street . the city 's securities industry , enumerating 163,400 jobs in august 2013 , continues to form the largest segment of the city 's financial sector and an important economic engine , accounting in 2012 for 5 percent of the city 's private sector jobs , 8.5 percent ( us $ 3.8 billion ) of its tax revenue , and 22 percent of the city 's total wages , including an average salary of us $ 360,700 . many large financial companies are headquartered in new york city , and the city is also home to a burgeoning number of financial startup companies .
political and religious animosity against jehovah 's witnesses has at times led to mob action and government oppression in various countries . their doctrine of political neutrality and their refusal to serve in the military has led to imprisonment of members who refused conscription during world war ii and at other times where national service has been compulsory . in 1933 , there were approximately 20,000 jehovah 's witnesses in germany , of whom about 10,000 were later imprisoned . of those , 2000 were sent to nazi concentration camps , where they were identified by purple triangles ; as many as 1200 died , including 250 who were executed . in canada , jehovah 's witnesses were interned in camps along with political dissidents and people of chinese and japanese descent . in the former soviet union , about 9,300 jehovah 's witnesses were deported to siberia as part of operation north in april 1951 . their religious activities are currently banned or restricted in some countries , including china , vietnam and some islamic states .
caesar held both the dictatorship and the tribunate , and alternated between the consulship and the proconsulship . in 48 bc , caesar was given permanent tribunician powers . this made his person sacrosanct , gave him the power to veto the senate , and allowed him to dominate the plebeian council . in 46 bc , caesar was given censorial powers , which he used to fill the senate with his own partisans . caesar then raised the membership of the senate to 900 . this robbed the senatorial aristocracy of its prestige , and made it increasingly subservient to him . while the assemblies continued to meet , he submitted all candidates to the assemblies for election , and all bills to the assemblies for enactment . thus , the assemblies became powerless and were unable to oppose him .
northwestern was founded in 1851 by john evans , for whom the city of evanston is named , and eight other lawyers , businessmen and methodist leaders . its founding purpose was to serve the northwest territory , an area that today includes the states of ohio , indiana , illinois , michigan , wisconsin and parts of minnesota . instruction began in 1855 ; women were admitted in 1869 . today , the main campus is a 240-acre ( 97 ha ) parcel in evanston , along the shores of lake michigan just 12 miles north of downtown chicago . the university 's law , medical , and professional schools are located on a 25-acre ( 10 ha ) campus in chicago 's streeterville neighborhood . in 2008 , the university opened a campus in education city , doha , qatar with programs in journalism and communication .
as the economic situation worsened macdonald agreed to form a " national government " with the conservatives and the liberals . on 24 august 1931 macdonald submitted the resignation of his ministers and led a small number of his senior colleagues in forming the national government together with the other parties . this caused great anger among those within the labour party who felt betrayed by macdonald 's actions : he and his supporters were promptly expelled from the labour party and formed a separate national labour organisation . the remaining labour party mps ( led again by arthur henderson ) and a few liberals went into opposition . the ensuing 1931 general election resulted in overwhelming victory for the national government and disaster for the labour party which won only 52 seats , 225 fewer than in 1929 .
the brewing industry is a global business , consisting of several dominant multinational companies and many thousands of smaller producers ranging from brewpubs to regional breweries . more than 133 billion litres ( 35 billion gallons ) are sold per year - producing total global revenues of $ 294.5 billion ( £ 147.7 billion ) in 2006 . the history of breweries has been one of absorbing smaller breweries in order to ensure economy of scale . in 2002 south african breweries bought the north american miller brewing company to found sabmiller , becoming the second largest brewery , after north american anheuser-bush . in 2004 the belgian interbrew was the third largest brewery by volume and the brazilian ambev was the fifth largest . they merged into inbev , becoming the largest brewery . in 2007 , sabmiller surpassed inbev and anheuser-bush when it acquired royal grolsch , brewer of dutch premium beer brand grolsch in 2007 . in 2008 , inbev ( the second-largest ) bought anheuser-busch ( the third largest ) , the new anheuser-busch inbev company became again the largest brewer in the world . as of 2015 [ update ] ab inbev is the largest brewery , with sabmiller second , and heineken international third .
from as early as 1935 japanese military strategists had concluded the dutch east indies were , because of their oil reserves , of considerable importance to japan . by 1940 they had expanded this to include indo-china , malaya , and the philippines within their concept of the greater east asia co-prosperity sphere . japanese troop build ups in hainan , taiwan , and haiphong were noted , japanese army officers were openly talking about an inevitable war , and admiral sankichi takahashi was reported as saying a showdown with the united states was necessary .
the ability of bacteria to degrade a variety of organic compounds is remarkable and has been used in waste processing and bioremediation . bacteria capable of digesting the hydrocarbons in petroleum are often used to clean up oil spills . fertilizer was added to some of the beaches in prince william sound in an attempt to promote the growth of these naturally occurring bacteria after the 1989 exxon valdez oil spill . these efforts were effective on beaches that were not too thickly covered in oil . bacteria are also used for the bioremediation of industrial toxic wastes . in the chemical industry , bacteria are most important in the production of enantiomerically pure chemicals for use as pharmaceuticals or agrichemicals .
spielberg 's films often deal with several recurring themes . most of his films deal with ordinary characters searching for or coming in contact with extraordinary beings or finding themselves in extraordinary circumstances . in an afi interview in august 2000 spielberg commented on his interest in the possibility of extra terrestrial life and how it has influenced some of his films . spielberg described himself as feeling like an alien during childhood , and his interest came from his father , a science fiction fan , and his opinion that aliens would not travel light years for conquest , but instead curiosity and sharing of knowledge .
in game play , players attempt to create goal-scoring opportunities through individual control of the ball , such as by dribbling , passing the ball to a team-mate , and by taking shots at the goal , which is guarded by the opposing goalkeeper . opposing players may try to regain control of the ball by intercepting a pass or through tackling the opponent in possession of the ball ; however , physical contact between opponents is restricted . football is generally a free-flowing game , with play stopping only when the ball has left the field of play or when play is stopped by the referee for an infringement of the rules . after a stoppage , play recommences with a specified restart .
at the start of a classic valley glacier is a bowl-shaped cirque , which has escarped walls on three sides but is open on the side that descends into the valley . cirques are where ice begins to accumulate in a glacier . two glacial cirques may form back to back and erode their backwalls until only a narrow ridge , called an arete is left . this structure may result in a mountain pass . if multiple cirques encircle a single mountain , they create pointed pyramidal peaks ; particularly steep examples are called horns .
in lemon v. kurtzman , 403 u.s. 602 ( 1971 ) , the court determined that a pennsylvania state policy of reimbursing the salaries and related costs of teachers of secular subjects in private religious schools violated the establishment clause . the court 's decision argued that the separation of church and state could never be absolute : " our prior holdings do not call for total separation between church and state ; total separation is not possible in an absolute sense . some relationship between government and religious organizations is inevitable , " the court wrote . " judicial caveats against entanglement must recognize that the line of separation , far from being a " wall , " is a blurred , indistinct , and variable barrier depending on all the circumstances of a particular relationship . "
since 2009 , the tucson festival of books has been held annually over a two-day period in march at the university of arizona . by 2010 it had become the fourth largest book festival in the united states , with 450 authors and 80,000 attendees . in addition to readings and lectures , it features a science fair , varied entertainment , food , and exhibitors ranging from local retailers and publishers to regional and national nonprofit organizations . in 2011 , the festival began presenting a founder 's award ; recipients include elmore leonard and r.l. stine .
queen drew artistic influence from british rock acts of the 1960s and early 1970s , such as the beatles , the kinks , cream , led zeppelin , pink floyd , the who , black sabbath , slade , deep purple , david bowie , genesis and yes , in addition to american guitarist jimi hendrix , with mercury also inspired by the gospel singer aretha franklin . may referred to the beatles as being " our bible in the way they used the studio and they painted pictures and this wonderful instinctive use of harmonies . " at their outset in the early 1970s , queen 's music has been characterised as " led zeppelin meets yes " due to its combination of " acoustic / electric guitar extremes and fantasy-inspired multi-part song epics . "
qing china reached its largest extent during the 18th century , when it ruled china proper ( eighteen provinces ) as well as the areas of present-day northeast china , inner mongolia , outer mongolia , xinjiang and tibet , at approximately 13 million km2 in size . there were originally 18 provinces , all of which in china proper , but later this number was increased to 22 , with manchuria and xinjiang being divided or turned into provinces . taiwan , originally part of fujian province , became a province of its own in the late 19th century , but was ceded to the empire of japan in 1895 following the first sino-japanese war . in addition , many surrounding countries , such as korea ( joseon dynasty ) , vietnam frequently paid tribute to china during much of this period . khanate of kokand were forced to submit as protectorate and pay tribute to the qing dynasty in china between 1774 and 1798 .
taira kiyomori emerged as the real power in japan following the minamoto 's destruction , and he would remain in command for the next 20 years . he gave his daughter tokuko in marriage to the young emperor takakura , who died at only 19 , leaving their infant son antoku to succeed to the throne . kiyomori filled no less than 50 government posts with his relatives , rebuilt the inland sea , and encouraged trade with sung china . he also took aggressive actions to safeguard his power when necessary , including the removal and exile of 45 court officials and the razing of two troublesome temples , todai-ji and kofuku-ji .
two groups g and h are called isomorphic if there exist group homomorphisms a : g → h and b : h → g , such that applying the two functions one after another in each of the two possible orders gives the identity functions of g and h. that is , a ( b ( h ) ) = h and b ( a ( g ) ) = g for any g in g and h in h. from an abstract point of view , isomorphic groups carry the same information . for example , proving that g • g = 1g for some element g of g is equivalent to proving that a ( g ) ∗ a ( g ) = 1h , because applying a to the first equality yields the second , and applying b to the second gives back the first .
the baltic way or baltic chain ( also chain of freedom estonian : balti kett , latvian : baltijas cels , lithuanian : baltijos kelias , russian : балтиискии путь ) was a peaceful political demonstration on august 23 , 1989 . an estimated 2 million people joined hands to form a human chain extending 600 kilometres ( 370 mi ) across estonia , latvia and lithuania , which had been forcibly reincorporated into the soviet union in 1944 . the colossal demonstration marked the 50th anniversary of the molotov-ribbentrop pact that divided eastern europe into spheres of influence and led to the occupation of the baltic states in 1940 .
in response to the pressure on hot ac , a new kind of ac format cropped up among american radio recently . the urban adult contemporary format ( a term coined by barry mayo ) usually attracts a large number of african americans and sometimes caucasian listeners through playing a great deal of r & b ( without any form of rapping ) , gospel music , classic soul and dance music ( including disco ) .
in theravada buddhism , the ultimate goal is the attainment of the sublime state of nirvana , achieved by practicing the noble eightfold path ( also known as the middle way ) , thus escaping what is seen as a cycle of suffering and rebirth . mahayana buddhism instead aspires to buddhahood via the bodhisattva path , a state wherein one remains in this cycle to help other beings reach awakening . tibetan buddhism aspires to buddhahood or rainbow body .
lancashire emerged as a major commercial and industrial region during the industrial revolution . manchester and liverpool grew into its largest cities , dominating global trade and the birth of modern capitalism . the county contained several mill towns and the collieries of the lancashire coalfield . by the 1830s , approximately 85 % of all cotton manufactured worldwide was processed in lancashire . accrington , blackburn , bolton , burnley , bury , chorley , colne , darwen , nelson , oldham , preston , rochdale and wigan were major cotton mill towns during this time . blackpool was a centre for tourism for the inhabitants of lancashire 's mill towns , particularly during wakes week .
the nazis , led by adolf hitler , attempted to unite all the people they claimed were " germans " ( volksdeutsche ) into one realm , including ethnic germans in eastern europe , many of whom had emigrated more than one hundred fifty years before and developed separate cultures in their new lands . this idea was initially welcomed by many ethnic germans in sudetenland , austria , poland , danzig and western lithuania , particularly the germans from klaipeda ( memel ) . the swiss resisted the idea . they had viewed themselves as a distinctly separate nation since the peace of westphalia of 1648 .
muammar gaddafi was born in a tent near qasr abu hadi , a rural area outside the town of sirte in the deserts of western libya . his family came from a small , relatively un-influential tribal group called the qadhadhfa , who were arabized berber in heritage . his father , mohammad abdul salam bin hamed bin mohammad , was known as abu meniar ( died 1985 ) , and his mother was named aisha ( died 1978 ) ; abu meniar earned a meager subsistence as a goat and camel herder . nomadic bedouins , they were illiterate and kept no birth records . as such , gaddafi 's date of birth is not known with certainty , and sources have set it in 1942 or in the spring of 1943 , although biographers blundy and lycett noted that it could have been pre-1940 . his parents ' only surviving son , he had three older sisters . gaddafi 's upbringing in bedouin culture influenced his personal tastes for the rest of his life . he repeatedly expressed a preference for the desert over the city and retreated to the desert to meditate .
according to the international organization for migration , nigeria witnessed a dramatic increase in remittances sent home from overseas nigerians , going from usd 2.3 billion in 2004 to 17.9 billion in 2007 . the united states accounts for the largest portion of official remittances , followed by the united kingdom , italy , canada , spain and france . on the african continent , egypt , equatorial guinea , chad , libya and south africa are important source countries of remittance flows to nigeria , while china is the biggest remittance-sending country in asia .
widespread rumors of napoleon 's return from st. helena and napoleon as an inspiration for patriotism , individual and collective liberties , and political mobilization manifested themselves in seditious materials , displaying the tricolor and rosettes . there were also subversive activities celebrating anniversaries of napoleon 's life and reign and disrupting royal celebrations - they demonstrated the prevailing and successful goal of the varied supporters of napoleon to constantly destabilize the bourbon regime .
after secretly crossing the yalu river on 19 october , the pva 13th army group launched the first phase offensive on 25 october , attacking the advancing un forces near the sino-korean border . this military decision made solely by china changed the attitude of the soviet union . twelve days after chinese troops entered the war , stalin allowed the soviet air force to provide air cover , and supported more aid to china . after decimating the rok ii corps at the battle of onjong , the first confrontation between chinese and u.s. military occurred on 1 november 1950 ; deep in north korea , thousands of soldiers from the pva 39th army encircled and attacked the u.s. 8th cavalry regiment with three-prong assaults - from the north , northwest , and west - and overran the defensive position flanks in the battle of unsan . the surprise assault resulted in the un forces retreating back to the ch 'ongch 'on river , while the chinese unexpectedly disappeared into mountain hideouts following victory . it is unclear why the chinese did not press the attack and follow up their victory .
there are 119,500 males within the city and 117,400 females . the 20-24 age range is the most populous , with an estimated 32,300 people falling in this age range . next largest is the 25-29 range with 24,700 people and then 30-34 years with 17,800 . by population , southampton is the largest monocentric city in the south east england region and the second largest on the south coast after plymouth .
a number of common human foods and household ingestibles are toxic to dogs , including chocolate solids ( theobromine poisoning ) , onion and garlic ( thiosulphate , sulfoxide or disulfide poisoning ) , grapes and raisins , macadamia nuts , xylitol , as well as various plants and other potentially ingested materials . the nicotine in tobacco can also be dangerous . dogs can get it by scavenging in garbage or ashtrays ; eating cigars and cigarettes . signs can be vomiting of large amounts ( e.g. , from eating cigar butts ) or diarrhea . some other signs are abdominal pain , loss of coordination , collapse , or death . dogs are highly susceptible to theobromine poisoning , typically from ingestion of chocolate . theobromine is toxic to dogs because , although the dog 's metabolism is capable of breaking down the chemical , the process is so slow that even small amounts of chocolate can be fatal , especially dark chocolate .
the university operates under 11 colleges or schools , which collectively offer 194 bachelor 's degree programs , 68 master 's degree programs , 25 phd programs , and a juris doctor program . byu also manages some courses and majors through the david m. kennedy center for international studies and " miscellaneous " college departments , including undergraduate education , graduate studies , independent study , continuing education , and the honors program . byu 's winter semester ends earlier than most universities in april since there is no spring break , thus allowing students to pursue internships and other summer activities earlier . a typical academic year is broken up into two semesters : fall ( september-december ) and winter ( january-april ) , as well as two shorter terms during the summer months : spring ( may-june ) and summer ( july-august ) .
all sacrifices and offerings required an accompanying prayer to be effective . pliny the elder declared that " a sacrifice without prayer is thought to be useless and not a proper consultation of the gods . " prayer by itself , however , had independent power . the spoken word was thus the single most potent religious action , and knowledge of the correct verbal formulas the key to efficacy . accurate naming was vital for tapping into the desired powers of the deity invoked , hence the proliferation of cult epithets among roman deities . public prayers ( prex ) were offered loudly and clearly by a priest on behalf of the community . public religious ritual had to be enacted by specialists and professionals faultlessly ; a mistake might require that the action , or even the entire festival , be repeated from the start . the historian livy reports an occasion when the presiding magistrate at the latin festival forgot to include the " roman people " among the list of beneficiaries in his prayer ; the festival had to be started over . even private prayer by an individual was formulaic , a recitation rather than a personal expression , though selected by the individual for a particular purpose or occasion .
early during the taiping rebellion , qing forces suffered a series of disastrous defeats culminating in the loss of the regional capital city of nanjing in 1853 . shortly thereafter , a taiping expeditionary force penetrated as far north as the suburbs of tianjin , the imperial heartlands . in desperation the qing court ordered a chinese official , zeng guofan , to organize regional and village militias into an emergency army called tuanlian . zeng guofan 's strategy was to rely on local gentry to raise a new type of military organization from those provinces that the taiping rebels directly threatened . this new force became known as the xiang army , named after the hunan region where it was raised . the xiang army was a hybrid of local militia and a standing army . it was given professional training , but was paid for out of regional coffers and funds its commanders - mostly members of the chinese gentry - could muster . the xiang army and its successor , the huai army , created by zeng guofan 's colleague and mentee li hongzhang , were collectively called the " yong ying " ( brave camp ) .
mathematics : from the earliest the chinese used a positional decimal system on counting boards in order to calculate . to express 10 , a single rod is placed in the second box from the right . the spoken language uses a similar system to english : e.g. four thousand two hundred seven . no symbol was used for zero . by the 1st century bc , negative numbers and decimal fractions were in use and the nine chapters on the mathematical art included methods for extracting higher order roots by horner 's method and solving linear equations and by pythagoras ' theorem . cubic equations were solved in the tang dynasty and solutions of equations of order higher than 3 appeared in print in 1245 ad by ch 'in chiu-shao . pascal 's triangle for binomial coefficients was described around 1100 by jia xian .
the umayyad caliphate was marked both by territorial expansion and by the administrative and cultural problems that such expansion created . despite some notable exceptions , the umayyads tended to favor the rights of the old arab families , and in particular their own , over those of newly converted muslims ( mawali ) . therefore , they held to a less universalist conception of islam than did many of their rivals . as g.r. hawting has written , " islam was in fact regarded as the property of the conquering aristocracy . "
many arrangements of electrical contacts are used . large lamps may have a screw base ( one or more contacts at the tip , one at the shell ) or a bayonet base ( one or more contacts on the base , shell used as a contact or used only as a mechanical support ) . some tubular lamps have an electrical contact at either end . miniature lamps may have a wedge base and wire contacts , and some automotive and special purpose lamps have screw terminals for connection to wires . contacts in the lamp socket allow the electric current to pass through the base to the filament . power ratings for incandescent light bulbs range from about 0.1 watt to about 10,000 watts .
in september 1941 , through the " action lauterbacher " plan , a ghettoisation of the remaining hanoverian jewish families began . even before the wannsee conference , on 15 december 1941 , the first jews from hanover were deported to riga . a total of 2,400 people were deported , and very few survived . during the war seven concentration camps were constructed in hanover , in which many jews were confined . of the approximately 4,800 jews who had lived in hannover in 1938 , fewer than 100 were still in the city when troops of the united states army arrived on 10 april 1945 to occupy hanover at the end of the war . [ citation needed ] today , a memorial at the opera square is a reminder of the persecution of the jews in hanover . after the war a large group of orthodox jewish survivors of the nearby bergen-belsen concentration camp settled in hanover .
quakers , or friends , are members of a family of religious movements collectively known as the religious society of friends . the central unifying doctrine of these movements is the priesthood of all believers . many friends view themselves as members of a christian denomination . they include those with evangelical , holiness , liberal , and traditional conservative quaker understandings of christianity . unlike many other groups that emerged within christianity , the religious society of friends has actively tried to avoid creeds and hierarchical structures .
early progress toward the development of vaccines occurred throughout this period , primarily in the form of academic and government-funded basic research directed toward the identification of the pathogens responsible for common communicable diseases . in 1885 louis pasteur and pierre paul emile roux created the first rabies vaccine . the first diphtheria vaccines were produced in 1914 from a mixture of diphtheria toxin and antitoxin ( produced from the serum of an inoculated animal ) , but the safety of the inoculation was marginal and it was not widely used . the united states recorded 206,000 cases of diphtheria in 1921 resulting in 15,520 deaths . in 1923 parallel efforts by gaston ramon at the pasteur institute and alexander glenny at the wellcome research laboratories ( later part of glaxosmithkline ) led to the discovery that a safer vaccine could be produced by treating diphtheria toxin with formaldehyde . in 1944 , maurice hilleman of squibb pharmaceuticals developed the first vaccine against japanese encephelitis . hilleman would later move to merck where he would play a key role in the development of vaccines against measles , mumps , chickenpox , rubella , hepatitis a , hepatitis b , and meningitis .
zhejiang benefited less from central government investment than some other provinces due to its lack of natural resources , a location vulnerable to potential flooding from the sea , and an economic base at the national average . zhejiang , however , has been an epicenter of capitalist development in china , and has led the nation in the development of a market economy and private enterprises . northeast zhejiang , as part of the yangtze delta , is flat , more developed , and industrial .
charleston has a humid subtropical climate ( koppen climate classification cfa ) , with mild winters , hot , humid summers , and significant rainfall all year long . summer is the wettest season ; almost half of the annual rainfall occurs from june to september in the form of thundershowers . fall remains relatively warm through november . winter is short and mild , and is characterized by occasional rain . measurable snow ( ≥ 0.1 in or 0.25 cm ) only occurs several times per decade at the most , with the last such event occurring december 26 , 2010 . however , 6.0 in ( 15 cm ) fell at the airport on december 23 , 1989 , the largest single-day fall on record , contributing to a single-storm and seasonal record of 8.0 in ( 20 cm ) snowfall .
wever argued that the luftwaffe general staff should not be solely educated in tactical and operational matters . he argued they should be educated in grand strategy , war economics , armament production , and the mentality of potential opponents ( also known as mirror imaging ) . wever 's vision was not realised ; the general staff studies in those subjects fell by the wayside , and the air academies focused on tactics , technology , and operational planning , rather than on independent strategic air offensives .
but bt cotton is ineffective against many cotton pests , however , such as plant bugs , stink bugs , and aphids ; depending on circumstances it may still be desirable to use insecticides against these . a 2006 study done by cornell researchers , the center for chinese agricultural policy and the chinese academy of science on bt cotton farming in china found that after seven years these secondary pests that were normally controlled by pesticide had increased , necessitating the use of pesticides at similar levels to non-bt cotton and causing less profit for farmers because of the extra expense of gm seeds . however , a 2009 study by the chinese academy of sciences , stanford university and rutgers university refuted this . they concluded that the gm cotton effectively controlled bollworm . the secondary pests were mostly miridae ( plant bugs ) whose increase was related to local temperature and rainfall and only continued to increase in half the villages studied . moreover , the increase in insecticide use for the control of these secondary insects was far smaller than the reduction in total insecticide use due to bt cotton adoption . a 2012 chinese study concluded that bt cotton halved the use of pesticides and doubled the level of ladybirds , lacewings and spiders . the international service for the acquisition of agri-biotech applications ( isaaa ) said that , worldwide , gm cotton was planted on an area of 25 million hectares in 2011 . this was 69 % of the worldwide total area planted in cotton .
special bundles of the game contain a wolf link amiibo figurine , which unlocks a wii u-exclusive dungeon called the " cave of shadows " and can carry data over to the upcoming 2016 zelda game . other zelda-related amiibo figurines have distinct functions : link and toon link replenish arrows , zelda and sheik restore link 's health , and ganondorf causes link to take twice as much damage .
the macintosh project was begun in 1979 by jef raskin , an apple employee who envisioned an easy-to-use , low-cost computer for the average consumer . he wanted to name the computer after his favorite type of apple , the mcintosh , but the spelling was changed to " macintosh " for legal reasons as the original was the same spelling as that used by mcintosh laboratory , inc . , the audio equipment manufacturer . steve jobs requested that mcintosh laboratory give apple a release for the name with its changed spelling so that apple could use it , but the request was denied , forcing apple to eventually buy the rights to use the name . ( a 1984 byte magazine article suggested apple changed the spelling only after " early users " misspelled " mcintosh . " however , jef raskin had adopted the macintosh spelling by 1981 , when the macintosh computer was still a single prototype machine in the lab . this explanation further clashes with the first explanation given above that the change was made for " legal reasons . " )
lee and guenther have rejected most of the arguments put forward by wilmsen . doron shultziner and others have argued that we can learn a lot about the life-styles of prehistoric hunter-gatherers from studies of contemporary hunter-gatherers - especially their impressive levels of egalitarianism .
a team led by enrico fermi in 1934 observed that bombarding uranium with neutrons produces the emission of beta rays ( electrons or positrons from the elements produced ; see beta particle ) . the fission products were at first mistaken for new elements of atomic numbers 93 and 94 , which the dean of the faculty of rome , orso mario corbino , christened ausonium and hesperium , respectively . the experiments leading to the discovery of uranium 's ability to fission ( break apart ) into lighter elements and release binding energy were conducted by otto hahn and fritz strassmann in hahn 's laboratory in berlin . lise meitner and her nephew , the physicist otto robert frisch , published the physical explanation in february 1939 and named the process " nuclear fission . " soon after , fermi hypothesized that the fission of uranium might release enough neutrons to sustain a fission reaction . confirmation of this hypothesis came in 1939 , and later work found that on average about 2.5 neutrons are released by each fission of the rare uranium isotope uranium-235 . further work found that the far more common uranium-238 isotope can be transmuted into plutonium , which , like uranium-235 , is also fissile by thermal neutrons . these discoveries led numerous countries to begin working on the development of nuclear weapons and nuclear power .
on 10 october 2009 , armenia and turkey signed protocols on normalisation of relationships , which set a timetable for restoring diplomatic ties and reopening their joint border . the ratification of those had to be made in the national parliaments . in armenia it passed through the required by legislation approval of the constitutional court and was sent to the parliament for the final ratification . the president had made multiple public announcements , both in armenia and abroad , that as the leader of the political majority of armenia he assured the ratification of the protocols if turkey also ratified them . despite this , the process stopped , as turkey continuously added more preconditions to its ratification and also " delayed it beyond any reasonable time-period . "
in addition to somali , arabic , which is also an afro-asiatic tongue , is an official national language in both somalia and djibouti . many somalis speak it due to centuries-old ties with the arab world , the far-reaching influence of the arabic media , and religious education . somalia and djibouti are also both members of the arab league .
because of its coastal location , the economy of plymouth has traditionally been maritime , in particular the defence sector with over 12,000 people employed and approximately 7,500 in the armed forces . the plymouth gin distillery has been producing plymouth gin since 1793 , which was exported around the world by the royal navy . during the 1930s , it was the most widely distributed gin and has a controlled term of origin . since the 1980s , employment in the defence sector has decreased substantially and the public sector is now prominent particularly in administration , health , education , medicine and engineering .
in terms of total number of ships , the greek merchant navy stands at 4th worldwide , with 3,150 ships ( 741 of which are registered in greece whereas the rest 2,409 in other ports ) . in terms of ship categories , greece ranks first in both tankers and dry bulk carriers , fourth in the number of containers , and fifth in other ships . however , today 's fleet roster is smaller than an all-time high of 5,000 ships in the late 1970s . additionally , the total number of ships flying a greek flag ( includes non-greek fleets ) is 1,517 , or 5.3 % of the world 's dwt ( ranked 5th ) .

the university is the major seat of the congregation of holy cross ( albeit not its official headquarters , which are in rome ) . its main seminary , moreau seminary , is located on the campus across st. joseph lake from the main building . old college , the oldest building on campus and located near the shore of st. mary lake , houses undergraduate seminarians . retired priests and brothers reside in fatima house ( a former retreat center ) , holy cross house , as well as columba hall near the grotto . the university through the moreau seminary has ties to theologian frederick buechner . while not catholic , buechner has praised writers from notre dame and moreau seminary created a buechner prize for preaching .
beginning in first decade of the 15th century , jan hus - a roman catholic priest , czech reformist and professor - influenced by john wycliffe 's writings , founded the hussite movement . he strongly advocated his reformist bohemian religious denomination . he was excommunicated and burned at the stake in constance , bishopric of constance in 1415 by secular authorities for unrepentant and persistent heresy . after his execution , a revolt erupted . hussites defeated five continuous crusades proclaimed against them by the pope .
the build was released for download later in the day in standard 32-bit and 64-bit versions , plus a special 64-bit version which included sdks and developer tools ( visual studio express and expression blend ) for developing metro-style apps . the windows store was announced during the presentation , but was not available in this build . according to microsoft , there were about 535,000 downloads of the developer preview within the first 12 hours of its release . originally set to expire on march 11 , 2012 , in february 2012 the developer preview 's expiry date was changed to january 15 , 2013 .
an mp3 file is made up of mp3 frames , which consist of a header and a data block . this sequence of frames is called an elementary stream . due to the " byte reservoir , " frames are not independent items and cannot usually be extracted on arbitrary frame boundaries . the mp3 data blocks contain the ( compressed ) audio information in terms of frequencies and amplitudes . the diagram shows that the mp3 header consists of a sync word , which is used to identify the beginning of a valid frame . this is followed by a bit indicating that this is the mpeg standard and two bits that indicate that layer 3 is used ; hence mpeg-1 audio layer 3 or mp3 . after this , the values will differ , depending on the mp3 file . iso / iec 11172-3 defines the range of values for each section of the header along with the specification of the header . most mp3 files today contain id3 metadata , which precedes or follows the mp3 frames , as noted in the diagram .
nigeria in recent years has been embracing industrialisation . it currently has an indigenous vehicle manufacturing company , innoson motors , which manufactures rapid transit buses , trucks and suvs with an upcoming introduction of cars . nigeria also has few electronic manufacturers like zinox , the first branded nigerian computer and electronic gadgets ( like tablet pcs ) manufacturers . in 2013 , nigeria introduced a policy regarding import duty on vehicles to encourage local manufacturing companies in the country . in this regard , some foreign vehicle manufacturing companies like nissan have made known their plans to have manufacturing plants in nigeria . ogun is considered to be the current nigeria 's industrial hub , as most factories are located in ogun and more companies are moving there , followed by lagos .
the ability of bacteria to degrade a variety of organic compounds is remarkable and has been used in waste processing and bioremediation . bacteria capable of digesting the hydrocarbons in petroleum are often used to clean up oil spills . fertilizer was added to some of the beaches in prince william sound in an attempt to promote the growth of these naturally occurring bacteria after the 1989 exxon valdez oil spill . these efforts were effective on beaches that were not too thickly covered in oil . bacteria are also used for the bioremediation of industrial toxic wastes . in the chemical industry , bacteria are most important in the production of enantiomerically pure chemicals for use as pharmaceuticals or agrichemicals .
the remaining group , people born in foreign countries with no french citizenship at birth , are those defined as immigrants under french law . according to the 2012 census , 135,853 residents of the city of paris were immigrants from europe , 112,369 were immigrants from the maghreb , 70,852 from sub-saharan africa and egypt , 5,059 from turkey , 91,297 from asia ( outside turkey ) , 38,858 from the americas , and 1,365 from the south pacific . note that the immigrants from the americas and the south pacific in paris are vastly outnumbered by migrants from french overseas regions and territories located in these regions of the world .
english freemasonry spread to france in the 1720s , first as lodges of expatriates and exiled jacobites , and then as distinctively french lodges which still follow the ritual of the moderns . from france and england , freemasonry spread to most of continental europe during the course of the 18th century . the grande loge de france formed under the grand mastership of the duke of clermont , who exercised only nominal authority . his successor , the duke of orleans , reconstituted the central body as the grand orient de france in 1773 . briefly eclipsed during the french revolution , french freemasonry continued to grow in the next century .
at this point , fox whispered that there was " no loss of friendship . " " i regret to say there is , " burke replied , " i have indeed made a great sacrifice ; i have done my duty though i have lost my friend . there is something in the detested french constitution that envenoms every thing it touches . " this provoked a reply from fox , yet he was unable to give his speech for some time since he was overcome with tears and emotion , he appealed to burke to remember their inalienable friendship , but also repeated his criticisms of burke and uttered " unusually bitter sarcasms . " this only aggravated the rupture between the two men . burke demonstrated his separation from the party on 5 june 1791 by writing to fitzwilliam , declining money from him .
despite repeated efforts by the tajik government to improve and expand health care , the system remains extremely underdeveloped and poor , with severe shortages of medical supplies . the state 's ministry of labor and social welfare reported that 104,272 disabled people are registered in tajikistan ( 2000 ) . this group of people suffers most from poverty in tajikistan . the government of tajikistan and the world bank considered activities to support this part of the population described in the world bank 's poverty reduction strategy paper . public expenditure on health was at 1 % of the gdp in 2004 .
the arabian oryx , a species of large antelope , once inhabited much of the desert areas of the middle east . however , the species ' striking appearance made it ( along with the closely related scimitar-horned oryx and addax ) a popular quarry for sport hunters , especially foreign executives of oil companies working in the region . [ citation needed ] the use of automobiles and high-powered rifles destroyed their only advantage : speed , and they became extinct in the wild exclusively due to sport hunting in 1972 . the scimitar-horned oryx followed suit , while the addax became critically endangered . however , the arabian oryx has now made a comeback and been upgraded from " extinct in the wild " to " vulnerable " due to conservation efforts like captive breeding
it is commonly believed that the earlier a defect is found , the cheaper it is to fix it . the following table shows the cost of fixing the defect depending on the stage it was found . for example , if a problem in the requirements is found only post-release , then it would cost 10-100 times more to fix than if it had already been found by the requirements review . with the advent of modern continuous deployment practices and cloud-based services , the cost of re-deployment and maintenance may lessen over time .
many swiss also follow ice hockey and support one of the 12 clubs in the league a , which is the most attended league in europe . in 2009 , switzerland hosted the iihf world championship for the 10th time . it also became world vice-champion in 2013 . the numerous lakes make switzerland an attractive place for sailing . the largest , lake geneva , is the home of the sailing team alinghi which was the first european team to win the america 's cup in 2003 and which successfully defended the title in 2007 . tennis has become an increasingly popular sport , and swiss players such as martina hingis , roger federer , and most recently , stanislas wawrinka have won multiple grand slams . swiss professional wrestler claudio castagnoli is currently signed with wwe , and is a former united states champion .
longer works are often divided into self-contained pieces , called movements , often with contrasting characters or moods . for instance , symphonies written during the classical period are usually divided into four movements : ( 1 ) an opening allegro in sonata form , ( 2 ) a slow movement , ( 3 ) a minuet or scherzo , and ( 4 ) a final allegro . these movements can then be further broken down into a hierarchy of smaller units : first sections , then periods , and finally phrases .
after the american revolutionary war , the number and proportion of free people of color increased markedly in the north and the south as slaves were freed . most northern states abolished slavery , sometimes , like new york , in programs of gradual emancipation that took more than two decades to be completed . the last slaves in new york were not freed until 1827 . in connection with the second great awakening , quaker and methodist preachers in the south urged slaveholders to free their slaves . revolutionary ideals led many men to free their slaves , some by deed and others by will , so that from 1782 to 1810 , the percentage of free people of color rose from less than one percent to nearly 10 percent of blacks in the south .
the bulk of masonic ritual consists of degree ceremonies . candidates for freemasonry are progressively initiated into freemasonry , first in the degree of entered apprentice . some time later , in a separate ceremony , they will be passed to the degree of fellowcraft , and finally they will be raised to the degree of master mason . in all of these ceremonies , the candidate is entrusted with passwords , signs and grips peculiar to his new rank . another ceremony is the annual installation of the master and officers of the lodge . in some jurisdictions installed master is valued as a separate rank , with its own secrets to distinguish its members . in other jurisdictions , the grade is not recognised , and no inner ceremony conveys new secrets during the installation of a new master of the lodge .
by mid-1950 , north korean forces numbered between 150,000 and 200,000 troops , organized into 10 infantry divisions , one tank division , and one air force division , with 210 fighter planes and 280 tanks , who captured scheduled objectives and territory , among them kaesong , chuncheon , uijeongbu , and ongjin . their forces included 274 t-34-85 tanks , 200 artillery pieces , 110 attack bombers , some 150 yak fighter planes , 78 yak trainers , and 35 reconnaissance aircraft . in addition to the invasion force , the north kpa had 114 fighters , 78 bombers , 105 t-34-85 tanks , and some 30,000 soldiers stationed in reserve in north korea . although each navy consisted of only several small warships , the north and south korean navies fought in the war as sea-borne artillery for their in-country armies .
a direct chartered cargo flight was made by china airlines from taiwan taoyuan international airport to chengdu shuangliu international airport sending some 100 tons of relief supplies donated by the tzu chi foundation and the red cross society of taiwan to the affected areas . approval from mainland chinese authorities was sought , and the chartered flight departed taipei at 17 : 00 cst , may 15 and arrived in chengdu by 20 : 30 cst . a rescue team from the red cross in taiwan was also scheduled to depart taipei on a mandarin airlines direct chartered flight to chengdu at 15 : 00 cst on may 16 .
water storage and supply for melbourne is managed by melbourne water , which is owned by the victorian government . the organisation is also responsible for management of sewerage and the major water catchments in the region as well as the wonthaggi desalination plant and north-south pipeline . water is stored in a series of reservoirs located within and outside the greater melbourne area . the largest dam , the thomson river dam , located in the victorian alps , is capable of holding around 60 % of melbourne 's water capacity , while smaller dams such as the upper yarra dam , yan yean reservoir , and the cardinia reservoir carry secondary supplies .
people with prolonged , frequent , or close contact with people with tb are at particularly high risk of becoming infected , with an estimated 22 % infection rate . a person with active but untreated tuberculosis may infect 10-15 ( or more ) other people per year . transmission should occur from only people with active tb - those with latent infection are not thought to be contagious . the probability of transmission from one person to another depends upon several factors , including the number of infectious droplets expelled by the carrier , the effectiveness of ventilation , the duration of exposure , the virulence of the m. tuberculosis strain , the level of immunity in the uninfected person , and others . the cascade of person-to-person spread can be circumvented by segregating those with active ( " overt " ) tb and putting them on anti-tb drug regimens . after about two weeks of effective treatment , subjects with nonresistant active infections generally do not remain contagious to others . if someone does become infected , it typically takes three to four weeks before the newly infected person becomes infectious enough to transmit the disease to others .
in europe , and other regions using the iso 216 paper sizing system , the weight is expressed in grammes per square metre ( g / m2 or usually just g ) of the paper . printing paper is generally between 60 g and 120 g . anything heavier than 160 g is considered card . the weight of a ream therefore depends on the dimensions of the paper and its thickness .
after the assassination of uthman in 656 , ali , a member of the quraysh tribe and the cousin and son-in-law of muhammad , was elected as the caliph . he soon met with resistance from several factions , owing to his relative political inexperience . ali moved his capital from medina to kufa . the resulting conflict , which lasted from 656 until 661 , is known as the first fitna ( " civil war " ) . muawiyah i , the governor of syria , a relative of uthman ibn al-affan and marwan i , wanted the culprits arrested . marwan i manipulated everyone and created conflict . aisha , the wife of muhammad , and talhah and al-zubayr , two of the companions of muhammad , went to basra to tell ali to arrest the culprits who murdered uthman . marwan i and other people who wanted conflict manipulated everyone to fight . the two sides clashed at the battle of the camel in 656 , where ali won a decisive victory .
present-day statutes from across the nation use the same words and phrases , requiring modern executions to take place within a wall or enclosure to exclude public view . connecticut general statute § 54-100 requires death sentences to be conducted in an " enclosure " which " shall be so constructed as to exclude public view . " kentucky revised statute 431.220 and missouri revised statute § 546.730 contain substantially identical language . new mexico 's former death penalty , since repealed , see n.m. stat . § 31-14-12 , required executions be conducted in a " room or place enclosed from public view . " similarly , a dormant massachusetts law , see mass . gen. law ch . 279 § 60 , required executions to take place " within an enclosure or building . " north carolina general statute § 15-188 requires death sentences to be executed " within the walls " of the penitentiary , as do oklahoma statute title 22 § 1015 and montana code § 46-19-103 . ohio revised code § 2949.22 requires that " [ t ] he enclosure shall exclude public view . " similarly , tennessee code § 40-23-116 requires " an enclosure " for " strict seclusion and privacy . " united states code title 18 § 3596 and the code of federal regulations 28 cfr 26.4 limit the witnesses permitted at federal executions .
samba schools are large , social entities with thousands of members and a theme for their song and parade each year . in rio carnival , samba schoolsparade in the sambadrome ( " sambodromo " in portuguese ) . some of the most famous include gres estacao primeira de mangueira , gres portela , gres imperatriz leopoldinense , gres beija-flor de nilopolis , gres mocidade independente de padre miguel , and recently , unidos da tijuca and gres uniao da ilha do governador . local tourists pay $ 500-950 , depending on the costume , to buy a samba costume and dance in the parade . blocos are small informal groups with a definite theme in their samba , usually satirizing the political situation . about 30 schools in rio gather hundreds of thousands of participants . more than 440 blocos operate in rio . bandas are samba musical bands , also called " street carnival bands , " usually formed within a single neighborhood or musical back-ground . the carnival industry chain amassed in 2012 almost us $ 1 billion in revenues .
during the age of discovery in the 15th and 16th centuries , portugal and spain pioneered european exploration of the globe , and in the process established large overseas empires . envious of the great wealth these empires generated , england , france , and the netherlands began to establish colonies and trade networks of their own in the americas and asia . a series of wars in the 17th and 18th centuries with the netherlands and france left england ( and then , following union between england and scotland in 1707 , great britain ) the dominant colonial power in north america and india .
the technical rules for the japanese version of men 's rhythmic gymnastics came around the 1970s . for individuals , only four types of apparatus are used : the double rings , the stick , the rope , and the clubs . groups do not use any apparatus . the japanese version includes tumbling performed on a spring floor . points are awarded based a 10-point scale that measures the level of difficulty of the tumbling and apparatus handling . on november 27-29 , 2003 , japan hosted first edition of the men 's rhythmic gymnastics world championship .
direction lanterns are also found both inside and outside elevator cars , but they should always be visible from outside because their primary purpose is to help people decide whether or not to get on the elevator . if somebody waiting for the elevator wants to go up , but a car comes first that indicates that it is going down , then the person may decide not to get on the elevator . if the person waits , then one will still stop going up . direction indicators are sometimes etched with arrows or shaped like arrows and / or use the convention that one that lights up red means " down " and green means " up . " since the color convention is often undermined or overridden by systems that do not invoke it , it is usually used only in conjunction with other differentiating factors . an example of a place whose elevators use only the color convention to differentiate between directions is the museum of contemporary art in chicago , where a single circle can be made to light up green for " up " and red for " down . " sometimes directions must be inferred by the position of the indicators relative to one another .
the statistics portugal ( portuguese : ine - instituto nacional de estatistica ) estimates that , according to the 2011 census , the population was 10,562,178 ( of which 52 % was female , 48 % was male ) . this population has been relatively homogeneous for most of its history : a single religion ( catholicism ) and a single language have contributed to this ethnic and national unity , namely after the expulsion of the moors and jews . a considerable number of moors and jews , nevertheless , stayed in portugal , under the condition that they converted to catholicism , and afterwards they were known as mouriscos ( former muslims ) and cristaos novos ( new christians or former jews ) some of whom may have continued to observe rabbinic judaism in secret , as in the case of the secret jews of belmonte , who now observe the jewish faith openly . after 1772 the distinction between old and new christians was abolished by decree . some famous portuguese new christians were the mathematician pedro nunes and the physician and naturalist garcia de orta .
control of labour and inter-group conflict is characteristic of corporate-level or ' tribal ' groups , headed by a charismatic individual ; whether a ' big man ' or a proto-chief , functioning as a lineage-group head . whether a non-hierarchical system of organization existed is debatable , and there is no evidence that explicitly suggests that neolithic societies functioned under any dominating class or individual , as was the case in the chiefdoms of the european early bronze age . theories to explain the apparent implied egalitarianism of neolithic ( and paleolithic ) societies have arisen , notably the marxist concept of primitive communism .
in november 2013 mgm and the mcclory estate formally settled the issue with danjaq , llc - sister company of eon productions - with mgm acquiring the full copyright film rights to the concept of spectre and all of the characters associated with it . with the acquisition of the film rights and the organisation 's re-introduction to the series ' continuity , the spectre acronym was discarded and the organisation reimagined as " spectre . "
towards the end of the 1990s and into the 2000s , producers such as daft punk , stardust , cassius , st. germain and dj falcon began producing a new sound out of paris 's house scene . together , they laid the groundwork for what would be known as the french house movement . by combining the harder-edged-yet-soulful philosophy of chicago house with the melodies of obscure funk , state-of-the-art production techniques and the sound of analog synthesizers , they began to create the standards that would shape all house music .
banner armies were organized along ethnic lines , namely manchu and mongol , but included non-manchu bondservants registered under the household of their manchu masters . the years leading up to the conquest increased the number of han chinese under manchu rule , leading hong taiji to create the eight han banners ( zh ) , and around the time of the qing takeover of beijing , their numbers rapidly swelled . han bannermen held high status and power in the early qing period , especially immediately after the conquest during shunzhi and kangxi 's reign where they dominated governor-generalships and governorships across china at the expense of both manchu bannermen and han civilians . han also numerically dominated the banners up until the mid 18th century . european visitors in beijing called them " tartarized chinese " or " tartarified chinese . " it was in qianlong 's reign that the qianlong emperor , concerned about maintaining manchu identity , re-emphasized manchu ethnicity , ancestry , language , and culture in the eight banners and started a mass discharge of han bannermen from the eight banners , either asking them to voluntarily resign from the banner rolls or striking their names off . this led to a change from han majority to a manchu majority within the banner system , and previous han bannermen garrisons in southern china such as at fuzhou , zhenjiang , guangzhou , were replaced by manchu bannermen in the purge , which started in 1754 . the turnover by qianlong most heavily impacted han banner garrisons stationed in the provinces while it less impacted han bannermen in beijing , leaving a larger proportion of remaining han bannermen in beijing than the provinces . han bannermen 's status was decreased from that point on with manchu banners gaining higher status . han bannermen numbered 75 % in 1648 shunzhi 's reign , 72 % in 1723 yongzheng 's reign , but decreased to 43 % in 1796 during the first year of jiaqing 's reign , which was after qianlong 's purge . the mass discharge was known as the disbandment of the han banners ( zh ) . qianlong directed most of his ire at those han bannermen descended from defectors who joined the qing after the qing passed through the great wall at shanhai pass in 1644 , deeming their ancestors as traitors to the ming and therefore untrustworthy , while retaining han bannermen who were descended from defectors who joined the qing before 1644 in liaodong and marched through shanhai pass , also known as those who " followed the dragon through the pass " ( 從龍入關 ; cong long ru guan ) .
theoretical obligations between a samurai and his lord ( usually a daimyo ) increased from the genpei era to the edo era . they were strongly emphasized by the teachings of confucius and mencius ( ca 550 bc ) , which were required reading for the educated samurai class . bushido was formalized by several influential leaders and families before the edo period . bushido was an ideal , and it remained fairly uniform from the 13th century to the 19th century - the ideals of bushido transcended social class , time and geographic location of the warrior class .
the aircraft carrier dramatically changed naval combat in world war ii , because air power was becoming a significant factor in warfare . the advent of aircraft as focal weapons was driven by the superior range , flexibility and effectiveness of carrier-launched aircraft . they had higher range and precision than naval guns , making them highly effective . the versatility of the carrier was demonstrated in november 1940 when hms illustrious launched a long-range strike on the italian fleet at their base in taranto , signalling the beginning of the effective and highly mobile aircraft strikes . this operation incapacitated three of the six battleships at a cost of two torpedo bombers . world war ii in the pacific ocean involved clashes between aircraft carrier fleets . the 1941 japanese surprise attack on pearl harbor was a clear illustration of the power projection capability afforded by a large force of modern carriers . concentrating six carriers in a single unit turned naval history about , as no other nation had fielded anything comparable . however , the vulnerability of carriers compared to traditional battleships when forced into a gun-range encounter was quickly illustrated by the sinking of hms glorious by german battleships during the norwegian campaign in 1940 .
gaddafi remained a controversial and divisive figure on the world stage throughout his life and after death . supporters praised gaddafi 's administration for the creation of an almost classless society through domestic reform . they stress the regime 's achievements in combating homelessness and ensuring access to food and safe drinking water . highlighting that under gaddafi , all libyans enjoyed free education to a university level , they point to the dramatic rise in literacy rates after the 1969 revolution . supporters have also applauded achievements in medical care , praising the universal free healthcare provided under the gaddafist administration , with diseases like cholera and typhoid being contained and life expectancy raised . biographers blundy and lycett believed that under the first decade of gaddafi 's leadership , life for most libyans " undoubtedly changed for the better " as material conditions and wealth drastically improved , while libyan studies specialist lillian craig harris remarked that in the early years of his administration , libya 's " national wealth and international influence soared , and its national standard of living has risen dramatically . " such high standards declined during the 1980s , as a result of economic stagnation . gaddafi claimed that his jamahiriya was a " concrete utopia , " and that he had been appointed by " popular assent , " with some islamic supporters believing that he exhibited barakah . his opposition to western governments earned him the respect of many in the euro-american far right .
atlantic city ( sometimes referred to as " monopoly city " ) has become well-known over the years for its portrayal in the u.s. version of the popular board game , monopoly , in which properties on the board are named after locations in and near atlantic city . while the original incarnation of the game did not feature atlantic city , it was in indianapolis that ruth hoskins learned the game , and took it back to atlantic city . after she arrived , hoskins made a new board with atlantic city street names , and taught it to a group of local quakers .
in 1713 farrukhsiyar , the mughal emperor , appointed asif jah i to be viceroy of the deccan , with the title nizam-ul-mulk ( administrator of the realm ) . in 1724 , asif jah i defeated mubariz khan to establish autonomy over the deccan suba , named the region hyderabad deccan , and started what came to be known as the asif jahi dynasty . subsequent rulers retained the title nizam ul-mulk and were referred to as asif jahi nizams , or nizams of hyderabad . the death of asif jah i in 1748 resulted in a period of political unrest as his sons , backed by opportunistic neighbouring states and colonial foreign forces , contended for the throne . the accession of asif jah ii , who reigned from 1762 to 1803 , ended the instability . in 1768 he signed the treaty of masulipatnam , surrendering the coastal region to the east india company in return for a fixed annual rent .
many early immigrant groups traveled to america to worship freely , particularly after the english civil war and religious conflict in france and germany . they included nonconformists like the puritans , who were protestant christians fleeing religious persecution from the anglican king of england . despite a common background , the groups ' views on religious toleration were mixed . while some such as roger williams of rhode island and william penn of pennsylvania ensured the protection of religious minorities within their colonies , others like the plymouth colony and massachusetts bay colony had established churches . the dutch colony of new netherland established the dutch reformed church and outlawed all other worship , though enforcement was sparse . religious conformity was desired partly for financial reasons : the established church was responsible for poverty relief , putting dissenting churches at a significant disadvantage .
more recent lancashire-born composers include hugh wood ( 1932- parbold ) , sir peter maxwell davies ( 1934- , salford ) , sir harrison birtwistle ( 1934- , accrington ) , gordon crosse ( 1937- , bury ) , john mccabe ( 1939-2015 , huyton ) , roger smalley ( 1943-2015 , swinton ) , nigel osborne ( 1948- , manchester ) , steve martland ( 1954-2013 , liverpool ) , simon holt ( 1958- , bolton ) and philip cashian ( 1963- , manchester ) . the royal manchester college of music was founded in 1893 to provide a northern counterpart to the london musical colleges . it merged with the northern college of music ( formed in 1920 ) to form the royal northern college of music in 1972 .
with regard to a safety net , hayek advocated " some provision for those threatened by the extremes of indigence or starvation , be if only in the interest of those who require protection against acts of desperation on the part of the needy . " as referenced in the section on " the economic calculation problem , " hayek wrote that " there is no reason why ... the state should not help to organize a comprehensive system of social insurance . " summarizing on this topic , wapshott writes " [ hayek ] advocated mandatory universal health care and unemployment insurance , enforced , if not directly provided , by the state . " bernard harcourt says that " hayek was adamant about this . " in the 1973 law , legislation , and liberty , hayek wrote :
slow progress has led to frustration , expressed by executive director of the global fund to fight aids , tuberculosis and malaria - mark dybul : " we have the tools to end tb as a pandemic and public health threat on the planet , but we are not doing it . " several international organizations are pushing for more transparency in treatment , and more countries are implementing mandatory reporting of cases to the government , although adherence is often sketchy . commercial treatment-providers may at times overprescribe second-line drugs as well as supplementary treatment , promoting demands for further regulations . the government of brazil provides universal tb-care , which reduces this problem . conversely , falling rates of tb-infection may not relate to the number of programs directed at reducing infection rates , but may be tied to increased level of education , income and health of the population . costs of the disease , as calculated by the world bank in 2009 may exceed 150 billion usd per year in " high burden " countries . lack of progress eradicating the disease may also be due to lack of patient follow-up - as among the 250m rural migrants in china .
dvaita vedanta is a dualistic interpretation of the vedas , espouses dualism by theorizing the existence of two separate realities . the first and the only independent reality , states the dvaita school , is that of vishnu or brahman . vishnu is the supreme self , in a manner similar to monotheistic god in other major religions . the distinguishing factor of dvaita philosophy , as opposed to monistic advaita vedanta , is that god takes on a personal role and is seen as a real eternal entity that governs and controls the universe . like vishishtadvaita vedanta subschool , dvaita philosophy also embraced vaishnavism , with the metaphysical concept of brahman in the vedas identified with vishnu and the one and only supreme being . however , unlike vishishtadvaita which envisions ultimate qualified nondualism , the dualism of dvaita was permanent .
a comprehensive school is a state school that does not select its intake on the basis of academic achievement or aptitude . this is in contrast to the selective school system , where admission is restricted on the basis of selection criteria . the term is commonly used in relation to england and wales , where comprehensive schools were introduced on an experimental basis in the 1940s and became more widespread from 1965 . about 90 % of british secondary school pupils now attend comprehensive schools . they correspond broadly to the public high school in the united states and canada and to the german gesamtschule .

the historical study of cubism began in the late 1920s , drawing at first from sources of limited data , namely the opinions of guillaume apollinaire . it came to rely heavily on daniel-henry kahnweiler 's book der weg zum kubismus ( published in 1920 ) , which centered on the developments of picasso , braque , leger , and gris . the terms " analytical " and " synthetic " which subsequently emerged have been widely accepted since the mid-1930s . both terms are historical impositions that occurred after the facts they identify . neither phase was designated as such at the time corresponding works were created . " if kahnweiler considers cubism as picasso and braque , " wrote daniel robbins , " our only fault is in subjecting other cubists ' works to the rigors of that limited definition . "

dst 's potential to save energy comes primarily from its effects on residential lighting , which consumes about 3.5 % of electricity in the united states and canada . delaying the nominal time of sunset and sunrise reduces the use of artificial light in the evening and increases it in the morning . as franklin 's 1784 satire pointed out , lighting costs are reduced if the evening reduction outweighs the morning increase , as in high-latitude summer when most people wake up well after sunrise . an early goal of dst was to reduce evening usage of incandescent lighting , which used to be a primary use of electricity . although energy conservation remains an important goal , energy usage patterns have greatly changed since then , and recent research is limited and reports contradictory results . electricity use is greatly affected by geography , climate , and economics , making it hard to generalize from single studies .
in the uk , the london , brighton and south coast railway pioneered overhead electrification of its suburban lines in london , london bridge to victoria being opened to traffic on 1 december 1909 . victoria to crystal palace via balham and west norwood opened in may 1911 . peckham rye to west norwood opened in june 1912 . further extensions were not made owing to the first world war . two lines opened in 1925 under the southern railway serving coulsdon north and sutton railway station . the lines were electrified at 6.7 kv 25 hz . it was announced in 1926 that all lines were to be converted to dc third rail and the last overhead electric service ran in september 1929 .
the capital village of each district administers and coordinates the affairs of the district and confers each district 's paramount title , amongst other responsibilities . for example , the district of a 'ana has its capital at leulumoega . the paramount title of a 'ana is the tuia 'ana . the orator group which confers this title - the faleiva ( house of nine ) - is based at leulumoega . this is also the same for the other districts . in the district of tuamasaga , the paramount title of the district - the malietoa title - is conferred by the faletuamasaga based in afega .
vacuum is useful in a variety of processes and devices . its first widespread use was in the incandescent light bulb to protect the filament from chemical degradation . the chemical inertness produced by a vacuum is also useful for electron beam welding , cold welding , vacuum packing and vacuum frying . ultra-high vacuum is used in the study of atomically clean substrates , as only a very good vacuum preserves atomic-scale clean surfaces for a reasonably long time ( on the order of minutes to days ) . high to ultra-high vacuum removes the obstruction of air , allowing particle beams to deposit or remove materials without contamination . this is the principle behind chemical vapor deposition , physical vapor deposition , and dry etching which are essential to the fabrication of semiconductors and optical coatings , and to surface science . the reduction of convection provides the thermal insulation of thermos bottles . deep vacuum lowers the boiling point of liquids and promotes low temperature outgassing which is used in freeze drying , adhesive preparation , distillation , metallurgy , and process purging . the electrical properties of vacuum make electron microscopes and vacuum tubes possible , including cathode ray tubes . the elimination of air friction is useful for flywheel energy storage and ultracentrifuges .
about 5 % of the nicaraguan population are indigenous . the largest indigenous group in nicaragua is the miskito people . their territory extended from cape camaron , honduras , to rio grande , nicaragua along the mosquito coast . there is a native miskito language , but large groups speak miskito coast creole , spanish , rama and other languages . the creole english came about through frequent contact with the british who colonized the area . many are christians . traditional miskito society was highly structured with a defined political structure . there was a king , but he did not have total power . instead , the power was split between himself , a governor , a general , and by the 1750s , an admiral . historical information on kings is often obscured by the fact that many of the kings were semi-mythical . another major group is the mayangna ( or sumu ) people , counting some 10,000 people .
freemasonry consists of fraternal organisations that trace their origins to the local fraternities of stonemasons , which from the end of the fourteenth century regulated the qualifications of stonemasons and their interaction with authorities and clients . the degrees of freemasonry retain the three grades of medieval craft guilds , those of apprentice , journeyman or fellow ( now called fellowcraft ) , and master mason . these are the degrees offered by craft ( or blue lodge ) freemasonry . members of these organisations are known as freemasons or masons . there are additional degrees , which vary with locality and jurisdiction , and are usually administered by different bodies than the craft degrees .
in 1795 , the prussian linguist and philosopher wilhelm von humboldt ( 1767-1835 ) called for an anthropology that would synthesize kant 's and herder 's interests . during the romantic era , scholars in germany , especially those concerned with nationalist movements - such as the nationalist struggle to create a " germany " out of diverse principalities , and the nationalist struggles by ethnic minorities against the austro-hungarian empire - developed a more inclusive notion of culture as " worldview " ( weltanschauung ) . according to this school of thought , each ethnic group has a distinct worldview that is incommensurable with the worldviews of other groups . although more inclusive than earlier views , this approach to culture still allowed for distinctions between " civilized " and " primitive " or " tribal " cultures .
armenians constitute the main population of armenia and the de facto independent nagorno-karabakh republic . there is a wide-ranging diaspora of around 5 million people of full or partial armenian ancestry living outside of modern armenia . the largest armenian populations today exist in russia , the united states , france , georgia , iran , ukraine , lebanon , and syria . with the exceptions of iran and the former soviet states , the present-day armenian diaspora was formed mainly as a result of the armenian genocide .
the vast majority of devices containing leds are " safe under all conditions of normal use , " and so are classified as " class 1 led product " / " led klasse 1 . " at present , only a few leds - extremely bright leds that also have a tightly focused viewing angle of 8 ° or less - could , in theory , cause temporary blindness , and so are classified as " class 2 . " the opinion of the french agency for food , environmental and occupational health & safety ( anses ) of 2010 , on the health issues concerning leds , suggested banning public use of lamps which were in the moderate risk group 2 , especially those with a high blue component in places frequented by children . in general , laser safety regulations - and the " class 1 , " " class 2 , " etc. system - also apply to leds .
the loss of viewers continued into season 12 , which saw the show hitting a number of series low in the 18-49 demo . the finale had 7.2 million fewer viewers than the previous season , and saw a drop of 44 % in the 18-49 demo . the season viewers averaged at 13.3 million , a drop of 24 % from the previous season . the thirteenth season suffered a huge decline in the 18-49 demographic , a drop of 28 % from the twelfth season , and american idol lost its top 10 position in the nielsen ratings by the end of the 2013-14 television season for the first time since its entry to the rankings in 2003 as a result , although the entire series to date had not yet been dropped from the nielsen top 30 rankings since its inception in 2002 .
according to the international energy agency , cellulosic ethanol biorefineries could allow biofuels to play a much bigger role in the future than organizations such as the iea previously thought . cellulosic ethanol can be made from plant matter composed primarily of inedible cellulose fibers that form the stems and branches of most plants . crop residues ( such as corn stalks , wheat straw and rice straw ) , wood waste , and municipal solid waste are potential sources of cellulosic biomass . dedicated energy crops , such as switchgrass , are also promising cellulose sources that can be sustainably produced in many regions .
during the second world war , general dornberger was the military head of the army 's rocket program , zanssen became the commandant of the peenemunde army rocket centre , and von braun was the technical director of the ballistic missile program . they would lead the team that built the aggregate-4 ( a-4 ) rocket , which became the first vehicle to reach outer space during its test flight program in 1942 and 1943 . by 1943 , germany began mass-producing the a-4 as the vergeltungswaffe 2 ( " vengeance weapon " 2 , or more commonly , v2 ) , a ballistic missile with a 320 kilometers ( 200 mi ) range carrying a 1,130 kilograms ( 2,490 lb ) warhead at 4,000 kilometers per hour ( 2,500 mph ) . its supersonic speed meant there was no defense against it , and radar detection provided little warning . germany used the weapon to bombard southern england and parts of allied-liberated western europe from 1944 until 1945 . after the war , the v-2 became the basis of early american and soviet rocket designs .
solar concentrating technologies such as parabolic dish , trough and scheffler reflectors can provide process heat for commercial and industrial applications . the first commercial system was the solar total energy project ( step ) in shenandoah , georgia , usa where a field of 114 parabolic dishes provided 50 % of the process heating , air conditioning and electrical requirements for a clothing factory . this grid-connected cogeneration system provided 400 kw of electricity plus thermal energy in the form of 401 kw steam and 468 kw chilled water , and had a one-hour peak load thermal storage . evaporation ponds are shallow pools that concentrate dissolved solids through evaporation . the use of evaporation ponds to obtain salt from sea water is one of the oldest applications of solar energy . modern uses include concentrating brine solutions used in leach mining and removing dissolved solids from waste streams . clothes lines , clotheshorses , and clothes racks dry clothes through evaporation by wind and sunlight without consuming electricity or gas . in some states of the united states legislation protects the " right to dry " clothes . unglazed transpired collectors ( utc ) are perforated sun-facing walls used for preheating ventilation air . utcs can raise the incoming air temperature up to 22 ° c ( 40 ° f ) and deliver outlet temperatures of 45-60 ° c ( 113-140 ° f ) . the short payback period of transpired collectors ( 3 to 12 years ) makes them a more cost-effective alternative than glazed collection systems . as of 2003 , over 80 systems with a combined collector area of 35,000 square metres ( 380,000 sq ft ) had been installed worldwide , including an 860 m2 ( 9,300 sq ft ) collector in costa rica used for drying coffee beans and a 1,300 m2 ( 14,000 sq ft ) collector in coimbatore , india , used for drying marigolds .
von neumann was born neumann janos lajos ( in hungarian the family name comes first ) , hebrew name yonah , in budapest , kingdom of hungary , which was then part of the austro-hungarian empire , to wealthy jewish parents of the haskalah . he was the eldest of three children . he had two younger brothers : michael , born in 1907 , and nicholas , who was born in 1911 . his father , neumann miksa ( max neumann ) was a banker , who held a doctorate in law . he had moved to budapest from pecs at the end of the 1880s . miksa 's father and grandfather were both born in ond ( now part of the town of szerencs ) , zemplen county , northern hungary . john 's mother was kann margit ( margaret kann ) ; her parents were jakab kann and katalin meisels . three generations of the kann family lived in spacious apartments above the kann-heller offices in budapest ; von neumann 's family occupied an 18-room apartment on the top floor .
the accession of valens gave a fresh lease of life to the arian party . he issued a decree banishing the bishops who had been deposed by constantius , but who had been permitted by jovian to return to their sees . the news created the greatest consternation in the city of alexandria itself , and the prefect , in order to prevent a serious outbreak , gave public assurance that the very special case of athanasius would be laid before the emperor . but the saint seems to have divined what was preparing in secret against him . he quietly withdrew from alexandria , 5 october , and took up his abode in a country house outside the city . valens , who seems to have sincerely dreaded the possible consequences of another popular outbreak , within a few weeks issued orders allowing athanasius to return to his episcopal see .
he also developed feynman diagrams , a bookkeeping device that helps in conceptualizing and calculating interactions between particles in spacetime , including the interactions between electrons and their antimatter counterparts , positrons . this device allowed him , and later others , to approach time reversibility and other fundamental processes . feynman 's mental picture for these diagrams started with the hard sphere approximation , and the interactions could be thought of as collisions at first . it was not until decades later that physicists thought of analyzing the nodes of the feynman diagrams more closely . feynman painted feynman diagrams on the exterior of his van .
josip broz was born to a croat father and slovene mother in the village of kumrovec , croatia . drafted into military service , he distinguished himself , becoming the youngest sergeant major in the austro-hungarian army of that time . after being seriously wounded and captured by the imperial russians during world war i , josip was sent to a work camp in the ural mountains . he participated in the october revolution , and later joined a red guard unit in omsk . upon his return home , broz found himself in the newly established kingdom of yugoslavia , where he joined the communist party of yugoslavia ( kpj ) .
excess water intake , without replenishment of sodium and potassium salts , leads to hyponatremia , which can further lead to water intoxication at more dangerous levels . a well-publicized case occurred in 2007 , when jennifer strange died while participating in a water-drinking contest . more usually , the condition occurs in long-distance endurance events ( such as marathon or triathlon competition and training ) and causes gradual mental dulling , headache , drowsiness , weakness , and confusion ; extreme cases may result in coma , convulsions , and death . the primary damage comes from swelling of the brain , caused by increased osmosis as blood salinity decreases . effective fluid replacement techniques include water aid stations during running / cycling races , trainers providing water during team games , such as soccer , and devices such as camel baks , which can provide water for a person without making it too hard to drink the water .
lucan depicts sextus pompeius , the doomed son of pompey the great , as convinced " the gods of heaven knew too little " and awaiting the battle of pharsalus by consulting with the thessalian witch erichtho , who practices necromancy and inhabits deserted graves , feeding on rotting corpses . erichtho , it is said , can arrest " the rotation of the heavens and the flow of rivers " and make " austere old men blaze with illicit passions . " she and her clients are portrayed as undermining the natural order of gods , mankind and destiny . a female foreigner from thessaly , notorious for witchcraft , erichtho is the stereotypical witch of latin literature , along with horace 's canidia .
the most popular available tourist destinations in myanmar include big cities such as yangon and mandalay ; religious sites in mon state , pindaya , bago and hpa-an ; nature trails in inle lake , kengtung , putao , pyin oo lwin ; ancient cities such as bagan and mrauk-u ; as well as beaches in nabule , ngapali , ngwe-saung , mergui . nevertheless , much of the country is off-limits to tourists , and interactions between foreigners and the people of myanmar , particularly in the border regions , are subject to police scrutiny . they are not to discuss politics with foreigners , under penalty of imprisonment and , in 2001 , the myanmar tourism promotion board issued an order for local officials to protect tourists and limit " unnecessary contact " between foreigners and ordinary burmese people .
along with professional services , media companies are concentrated in london and the media distribution industry is london 's second most competitive sector . the bbc is a significant employer , while other broadcasters also have headquarters around the city . many national newspapers are edited in london . london is a major retail centre and in 2010 had the highest non-food retail sales of any city in the world , with a total spend of around £ 64.2 billion . the port of london is the second-largest in the united kingdom , handling 45 million tonnes of cargo each year .
in several countries , like germany , the netherlands , switzerland and turkey , institutes of technology and polytechnics are institutions of higher education , and have been accredited to award academic degrees and doctorates . famous examples are the istanbul technical university , eth zurich , iyte , delft university of technology and rwth aachen , all considered universities .

the late jurassic spans from 163 million to 145 million years ago . the late jurassic featured a massive extinction of sauropods and ichthyosaurs due to the separation of pangaea into laurasia and gondwana in an extinction known as the jurassic-cretaceous extinction . sea levels rose , destroying fern prairies and creating shallows in its wake . ichthyosaurs went extinct whereas sauropods , as a whole , did not die out in the jurassic ; in fact , some species , like the titanosaurus , lived up to the k-t extinction . the increase in sea-levels opened up the atlantic sea way which would continue to get larger over time . the divided world would give opportunity for the diversification of new dinosaurs .
due to the centralisation of power and the viking invasions , there is relatively little written record of the non-wessex dialects after alfred 's unification . some mercian texts continued to be written , however , and the influence of mercian is apparent in some of the translations produced under alfred 's programme , many of which were produced by mercian scholars . other dialects certainly continued to be spoken , as is evidenced by the continued variation between their successors in middle and modern english . in fact , what would become the standard forms of middle english and of modern english are descended from mercian rather than west saxon , while scots developed from the northumbrian dialect . it was once claimed that , owing to its position at the heart of the kingdom of wessex , the relics of anglo-saxon accent , idiom and vocabulary were best preserved in the dialect of somerset .
the ricketts family acquired a majority interest in the cubs in 2009 , ending the tribune years . apparently handcuffed by the tribune 's bankruptcy and the sale of the club to the ricketts family , the cubs ' quest for a nl central 3-peat started with notice that there would be less invested into contracts than in previous years . chicago engaged st. louis in a see-saw battle for first place into august 2009 , but the cardinals played to a torrid 20-6 pace that month , designating their rivals to battle in the wild card race , from which they were eliminated in the season 's final week . the cubs were plagued by injuries in 2009 , and were only able to field their opening day starting lineup three times the entire season . third baseman aramis ramirez injured his throwing shoulder in an early may game against the milwaukee brewers , sidelining him until early july and forcing journeyman players like mike fontenot and aaron miles into more prominent roles . additionally , key players like derrek lee ( who still managed to hit .306 with 35 hr and 111 rbi that season ) , alfonso soriano and geovany soto also nursed nagging injuries . the cubs posted a winning record ( 83-78 ) for the third consecutive season , the first time the club had done so since 1972 , and a new era of ownership under the ricketts ' family was approved by mlb owners in early october .
southampton has been used for military embarkation , including during 18th-century wars with the french , the crimean war , and the boer war . southampton was designated no. 1 military embarkation port during the great war and became a major centre for treating the returning wounded and pows . it was also central to the preparations for the invasion of europe in 1944 .
large brushes are desired for a larger brush contact area to maximize motor output , but small brushes are desired for low mass to maximize the speed at which the motor can run without the brushes excessively bouncing and sparking . ( small brushes are also desirable for lower cost . ) stiffer brush springs can also be used to make brushes of a given mass work at a higher speed , but at the cost of greater friction losses ( lower efficiency ) and accelerated brush and commutator wear . therefore , dc motor brush design entails a trade-off between output power , speed , and efficiency / wear .
foreign students ' department for armenian diaspora established in 1957 later was enlarged and the enrollment of foreign students began . nowadays the ysmu is a medical institution corresponding to international requirements , trains medical staff for not only armenia and neighbor countries , i.e. iran , syria , lebanon , georgia , but also many other leading countries all over the world . a great number of foreign students from india , nepal , sri lanka , the usa and russian federation study together with armenian students . nowadays the university is ranked among famous higher medical institutions and takes its honorable place in the world directory of medical schools published by the who .
after the american revolutionary war , the number and proportion of free people of color increased markedly in the north and the south as slaves were freed . most northern states abolished slavery , sometimes , like new york , in programs of gradual emancipation that took more than two decades to be completed . the last slaves in new york were not freed until 1827 . in connection with the second great awakening , quaker and methodist preachers in the south urged slaveholders to free their slaves . revolutionary ideals led many men to free their slaves , some by deed and others by will , so that from 1782 to 1810 , the percentage of free people of color rose from less than one percent to nearly 10 percent of blacks in the south .
during the cold war , the asian power of japan and the european powers of the united kingdom , france , and west germany rebuilt their economies . france and the united kingdom maintained technologically advanced armed forces with power projection capabilities and maintain large defence budgets to this day . yet , as the cold war continued , authorities began to question if france and the united kingdom could retain their long-held statuses as great powers . china , with the world 's largest population , has slowly risen to great power status , with large growth in economic and military power in the post-war period . after 1949 , the republic of china began to lose its recognition as the sole legitimate government of china by the other great powers , in favour of the people 's republic of china . subsequently , in 1971 , it lost its permanent seat at the un security council to the people 's republic of china .
on the east side of the main park area is the national museum of visual arts . on this side , a very popular street market takes place every sunday . on the north side is an artificial lake with a little castle housing a municipal library for children . an area to its west is used as an open-air exhibition of photography . west of the park , across the coastal avenue rambla presidente wilson , stretches ramirez beach . directly west of the main park are , and belonging to parque rodo barrio , is the former parque hotel , now called edificio mercosur , seat of the parliament of the members countries of the mercosur . during the guerilla war the tupamaros frequently attacked buildings in this area , including the old hotel .
a misratan militia took gaddafi prisoner , beating him , causing serious injuries ; the events were filmed on a mobile phone . a video appears to picture gaddafi being poked or stabbed in the rear end " with some kind of stick or knife " or possibly a bayonet . pulled onto the front of a pick-up truck , he fell off as it drove away . his semi-naked , lifeless body was then placed into an ambulance and taken to misrata ; upon arrival , he was found to be dead . official ntc accounts claimed that gaddafi was caught in a cross-fire and died from his bullet wounds . other eye-witness accounts claimed that rebels had fatally shot gaddafi in the stomach ; a rebel identifying himself as senad el-sadik el-ureybi later claimed responsibility . gaddafi 's son mutassim , who had also been among the convoy , was also captured , and found dead several hours later , most probably from an extrajudicial execution . around 140 gaddafi loyalists were rounded up from the convoy ; tied up and abused , the corpses of 66 were found at the nearby mahari hotel , victims of extrajudicial execution . libya 's chief forensic pathologist , dr. othman al-zintani , carried out the autopsies of gaddafi , his son and jabr in the days following their deaths ; although the pathologist initially told the press that gaddafi had died from a gunshot wound to the head , the autopsy report was not made public .
the period saw several important technical innovations , like the principle of linear perspective found in the work of masaccio , and later described by brunelleschi . greater realism was also achieved through the scientific study of anatomy , championed by artists like donatello . this can be seen particularly well in his sculptures , inspired by the study of classical models . as the centre of the movement shifted to rome , the period culminated in the high renaissance masters da vinci , michelangelo and raphael .
in november 1945 , eisenhower returned to washington to replace marshall as chief of staff of the army . his main role was rapid demobilization of millions of soldiers , a slow job that was delayed by lack of shipping . eisenhower was convinced in 1946 that the soviet union did not want war and that friendly relations could be maintained ; he strongly supported the new united nations and favored its involvement in the control of atomic bombs . however , in formulating policies regarding the atomic bomb and relations with the soviets , truman was guided by the u.s. state department and ignored eisenhower and the pentagon . indeed , eisenhower had opposed the use of the atomic bomb against the japanese , writing , " first , the japanese were ready to surrender and it wasn 't necessary to hit them with that awful thing . second , i hated to see our country be the first to use such a weapon . " initially , eisenhower was characterized by hopes for cooperation with the soviets . he even visited warsaw in 1945 . invited by bolesław bierut and decorated with the highest military decoration , he was shocked by the scale of destruction in the city . however , by mid-1947 , as east-west tensions over economic recovery in germany and the greek civil war escalated , eisenhower gave up and agreed with a containment policy to stop soviet expansion .
following his victory in the battle of hastings , william , duke of normandy , was crowned king of england in the newly finished westminster abbey on christmas day 1066 . william constructed the tower of london , the first of the many norman castles in england to be rebuilt in stone , in the southeastern corner of the city , to intimidate the native inhabitants . in 1097 , william ii began the building of westminster hall , close by the abbey of the same name . the hall became the basis of a new palace of westminster .
since 1947 , canadian military units have participated in more than 200 operations worldwide , and completed 72 international operations . canadian soldiers , sailors , and aviators came to be considered world-class professionals through conspicuous service during these conflicts and the country 's integral participation in nato during the cold war , first gulf war , kosovo war , and in united nations peacekeeping operations , such as the suez crisis , golan heights , cyprus , croatia , bosnia , afghanistan , and libya . canada maintained an aircraft carrier from 1957 to 1970 during the cold war , which never saw combat but participated in patrols during the cuban missile crisis .
while many secular buildings exist from the late middle ages , it is in the buildings of cathedrals and great churches that gothic architecture displays its pertinent structures and characteristics to the fullest advantage . a gothic cathedral or abbey was , prior to the 20th century , generally the landmark building in its town , rising high above all the domestic structures and often surmounted by one or more towers and pinnacles and perhaps tall spires . these cathedrals were the skyscrapers of that day and would have been the largest buildings by far that europeans would ever have seen . it is in the architecture of these gothic churches that a unique combination of existing technologies established the emergence of a new building style . those technologies were the ogival or pointed arch , the ribbed vault , and the buttress .
although the adventist churches hold much in common , their theologies differ on whether the intermediate state is unconscious sleep or consciousness , whether the ultimate punishment of the wicked is annihilation or eternal torment , the nature of immortality , whether or not the wicked are resurrected after the millennium , and whether the sanctuary of daniel 8 refers to the one in heaven or one on earth . the movement has encouraged the examination of the whole bible , leading seventh-day adventists and some smaller adventist groups to observe the sabbath . the general conference of seventh-day adventists has compiled that church 's core beliefs in the 28 fundamental beliefs ( 1980 and 2005 ) , which use biblical references as justification .
in september 1940 the first alsatian resistance movement led by marcel weinum called la main noire ( the black hand ) was created . it was composed by a group of 25 young men aged from 14 to 18 years old who led several attacks against the german occupation . the actions culminated with the attack of the gauleiter robert wagner , the highest commander of alsace directly under the order of hitler . in march 1942 , marcel weinum was prosecuted by the gestapo and sentenced to be beheaded at the age of 18 in april 1942 in stuttgart , germany . his last words will be : " if i have to die , i shall die but with a pure heart . " from 1943 the city was bombarded by allied aircraft . while the first world war had not notably damaged the city , anglo-american bombing caused extensive destruction in raids of which at least one was allegedly carried out by mistake . in august 1944 , several buildings in the old town were damaged by bombs , particularly the palais rohan , the old customs house ( ancienne douane ) and the cathedral . on 23 november 1944 , the city was officially liberated by the 2nd french armoured division under general leclerc . he achieved the oath that he made with his soldiers , after the decisive capture of kufra . with the oath of kuffra , they swore to keep up the fight until the french flag flew over the cathedral of strasbourg .
natural uranium consists of three major isotopes : uranium-238 ( 99.28 % natural abundance ) , uranium-235 ( 0.71 % ) , and uranium-234 ( 0.0054 % ) . all three are radioactive , emitting alpha particles , with the exception that all three of these isotopes have small probabilities of undergoing spontaneous fission , rather than alpha emission . there are also five other trace isotopes : uranium-239 , which is formed when 238u undergoes spontaneous fission , releasing neutrons that are captured by another 238u atom ; uranium-237 , which is formed when 238u captures a neutron but emits two more , which then decays to neptunium-237 ; uranium-233 , which is formed in the decay chain of that neptunium-237 ; and finally , uranium-236 and -240 , which appear in the decay chain of primordial plutonium-244 . it is also expected that thorium-232 should be able to undergo double beta decay , which would produce uranium-232 , but this has not yet been observed experimentally .
the earliest recorded history of the region dates back to about 500 bce when much , if not all , of modern tajikistan was part of the achaemenid empire . some authors have also suggested that in the 7th and 6th century bce parts of modern tajikistan , including territories in the zeravshan valley , formed part of kambojas before it became part of the achaemenid empire . after the region 's conquest by alexander the great it became part of the greco-bactrian kingdom , a successor state of alexander 's empire . northern tajikistan ( the cities of khujand and panjakent ) was part of sogdia , a collection of city-states which was overrun by scythians and yuezhi nomadic tribes around 150 bce . the silk road passed through the region and following the expedition of chinese explorer zhang qian during the reign of wudi ( 141-87 bce ) commercial relations between han china and sogdiana flourished . sogdians played a major role in facilitating trade and also worked in other capacities , as farmers , carpetweavers , glassmakers , and woodcarvers .
official figures ( as of july 21 , 2008 12 : 00 cst ) stated that 69,197 were confirmed dead , including 68,636 in sichuan province , and 374,176 injured , with 18,222 listed as missing . the earthquake left about 4.8 million people homeless , though the number could be as high as 11 million . approximately 15 million people lived in the affected area . it was the deadliest earthquake to hit china since the 1976 tangshan earthquake , which killed at least 240,000 people , and the strongest in the country since the 1950 chayu earthquake , which registered at 8.5 on the richter magnitude scale . it is the 21st deadliest earthquake of all time . on november 6 , 2008 , the central government announced that it would spend 1 trillion rmb ( about us $ 146.5 billion ) over the next three years to rebuild areas ravaged by the earthquake , as part of the chinese economic stimulus program .
three other efforts to improve regulation of international pesticide trade are the united nations london guidelines for the exchange of information on chemicals in international trade and the united nations codex alimentarius commission . [ citation needed ] the former seeks to implement procedures for ensuring that prior informed consent exists between countries buying and selling pesticides , while the latter seeks to create uniform standards for maximum levels of pesticide residues among participating countries . both initiatives operate on a voluntary basis .
an alternative view offered by richard dawkins is of predation as a form of competition : the genes of both the predator and prey are competing for the body ( or ' survival machine ' ) of the prey organism . this is best understood in the context of the gene centered view of evolution . another manner in which predation and competition are connected is throughout intraguild predation . intraguild predators are those that kill and eat other predators of different species at the same trophic level , and thus that are potential competitors .
a major sporting event is the " independence day sports festival " held annually on 1 october . the most important sports event within the country is arguably the tuvalu games , which are held yearly since 2008 . tuvalu first participated in the pacific games in 1978 and in the commonwealth games in 1998 , when a weightlifter attended the games held at kuala lumpur , malaysia . two table tennis players attended the 2002 commonwealth games in manchester , england ; tuvalu entered competitors in shooting , table tennis and weightlifting at the 2006 commonwealth games in melbourne , australia ; three athletes participated in the 2010 commonwealth games in delhi , india , entering the discus , shot put and weightlifting events ; and a team of 3 weightlifters and 2 table tennis players attended the 2014 commonwealth games in glasgow . tuvaluan athletes have also participated in the men 's and women 's 100 metre sprints at the world championships in athletics from 2009 .
a new style of wafers composed of gallium-nitride-on-silicon ( gan-on-si ) is being used to produce white leds using 200-mm silicon wafers . this avoids the typical costly sapphire substrate in relatively small 100- or 150-mm wafer sizes . the sapphire apparatus must be coupled with a mirror-like collector to reflect light that would otherwise be wasted . it is predicted that by 2020 , 40 % of all gan leds will be made with gan-on-si . manufacturing large sapphire material is difficult , while large silicon material is cheaper and more abundant . led companies shifting from using sapphire to silicon should be a minimal investment .
much of the early extant evidence for the origins of mahayana comes from early chinese translations of mahayana texts . these mahayana teachings were first propagated into china by lokaksema , the first translator of mahayana sutras into chinese during the 2nd century ce . [ note 39 ] some scholars have traditionally considered the earliest mahayana sutras to include the very first versions of the prajnaparamita series , along with texts concerning aksobhya buddha , which were probably composed in the 1st century bce in the south of india . [ note 40 ]
as of 2010 the catholic church had the highest number of adherents as a single denomination in the boston-cambridge-newton metro area , with more than two million members and 339 churches , followed by the episcopal church with 58,000 adherents in 160 churches . the united church of christ had 55,000 members and 213 churches . the ucc is the successor of the city 's puritan religious traditions . old south church in boston is one of the oldest congregations in the united states . it was organized in 1669 by dissenters from the first church in boston ( 1630 ) . notable past members include samuel adams , william dawes , benjamin franklin , samuel sewall , and phillis wheatley . in 1773 , adams gave the signals from the old south meeting house that started the boston tea party .
according to a study by dr. paul brest , hispanics or " latinos " include immigrants who are descendants of immigrants from the countries comprising central and south america . in 1991 , mexican americans , puerto ricans , and cuban americans made up 80 % of the latino population in the united states . latinos are disadvantaged compared to white americans and are more likely to live in poverty . they are the least well educated major ethnic group and suffered a 3 % drop in high school completion rate while african americans experienced a 12 % increase between 1975-1990 . in 1990 , they constituted 9 % of the population , but only received 3.1 % of the bachelors 's degrees awarded . at times when it is favorable to lawmakers , latinos were considered " white " by the jim crow laws during the reconstruction . in other cases , according to paul brest , latinos have been classified as an inferior race and a threat to white purity . latinos have encountered considerable discrimination in areas such as employment , housing , and education . brest finds that stereotypes continue to be largely negative and many perceive latinos as " lazy , unproductive , and on the dole . " furthermore , native-born latino-americans and recent immigrants are seen as identical since outsiders tend not to differentiate between latino groups .
based on experience with german strategic bombing during world war i against the united kingdom , the british government estimated after the war that 50 casualties - with about one third killed - would result for every tonne of bombs dropped on london . the estimate of tonnes of bombs an enemy could drop per day grew as aircraft technology advanced , from 75 in 1922 , to 150 in 1934 , to 644 in 1937 . that year the committee on imperial defence estimated that an attack of 60 days would result in 600,000 dead and 1,200,000 wounded . news reports of the spanish civil war , such as the bombing of barcelona , supported the 50-casualties-per-tonne estimate . by 1938 experts generally expected that germany would attempt to drop as much as 3,500 tonnes in the first 24 hours of war and average 700 tonnes a day for several weeks . in addition to high explosive and incendiary bombs the enemy would possibly use poison gas and even bacteriological warfare , all with a high degree of accuracy . in 1939 military theorist basil liddell-hart predicted that 250,000 deaths and injuries in britain could occur in the first week of war .
at her silver jubilee in 1977 , the crowds and celebrations were genuinely enthusiastic , but in the 1980s , public criticism of the royal family increased , as the personal and working lives of elizabeth 's children came under media scrutiny . elizabeth 's popularity sank to a low point in the 1990s . under pressure from public opinion , she began to pay income tax for the first time , and buckingham palace was opened to the public . discontent with the monarchy reached its peak on the death of diana , princess of wales , though elizabeth 's personal popularity and support for the monarchy rebounded after her live television broadcast to the world five days after diana 's death .
these representations rely on presenting scenes directly to the eye for their own visible sake . they care for the schematic arrangements of bodies in space , but only as parts in a larger whole . while each scene has its own character and completeness it must fit into the general sequence to which it belongs . in these archaic pediments the sculptors use empty intervals , to suggest a passage to and fro a busy battlefield . the artists seem to have been dominated by geometrical pattern and order , and this was improved when classical art brought a greater freedom and economy .
buddhist meditation is fundamentally concerned with two themes : transforming the mind and using it to explore itself and other phenomena . according to theravada buddhism the buddha taught two types of meditation , samatha meditation ( sanskrit : samatha ) and vipassana meditation ( sanskrit : vipasyana ) . in chinese buddhism , these exist ( translated chih kuan ) , but chan ( zen ) meditation is more popular . according to peter harvey , whenever buddhism has been healthy , not only monks , nuns , and married lamas , but also more committed lay people have practiced meditation . according to routledge 's encyclopedia of buddhism , in contrast , throughout most of buddhist history before modern times , serious meditation by lay people has been unusual . the evidence of the early texts suggests that at the time of the buddha , many male and female lay practitioners did practice meditation , some even to the point of proficiency in all eight jhanas ( see the next section regarding these ) .

the roman catholic diocese of charleston office of education also operates out of the city and oversees several k-8 parochial schools , such as blessed sacrament school , christ our king school , charleston catholic school , nativity school , and divine redeemer school , all of which are " feeder " schools into bishop england high school , a diocesan high school within the city . bishop england , porter-gaud school , and ashley hall are the city 's oldest and most prominent private schools , and are a significant part of charleston history , dating back some 150 years .
the mongol yuan dynasty , through the bureau of buddhist and tibetan affairs , or xuanzheng yuan , ruled tibet through a top-level administrative department . one of the department 's purposes was to select a dpon-chen ( ' great administrator ' ) , usually appointed by the lama and confirmed by the mongol emperor in beijing . the sakya lama retained a degree of autonomy , acting as the political authority of the region , while the dpon-chen held administrative and military power . mongol rule of tibet remained separate from the main provinces of china , but the region existed under the administration of the yuan dynasty . if the sakya lama ever came into conflict with the dpon-chen , the dpon-chen had the authority to send chinese troops into the region .
carbon metabolism in bacteria is either heterotrophic , where organic carbon compounds are used as carbon sources , or autotrophic , meaning that cellular carbon is obtained by fixing carbon dioxide . heterotrophic bacteria include parasitic types . typical autotrophic bacteria are phototrophic cyanobacteria , green sulfur-bacteria and some purple bacteria , but also many chemolithotrophic species , such as nitrifying or sulfur-oxidising bacteria . energy metabolism of bacteria is either based on phototrophy , the use of light through photosynthesis , or based on chemotrophy , the use of chemical substances for energy , which are mostly oxidised at the expense of oxygen or alternative electron acceptors ( aerobic / anaerobic respiration ) .
while highly effective , the requirement for injection limited the use of norepinephrine [ clarification needed ] and orally active derivatives were sought . a structurally similar compound , ephedrine , was identified by japanese chemists in the ma huang plant and marketed by eli lilly as an oral treatment for asthma . following the work of henry dale and george barger at burroughs-wellcome , academic chemist gordon alles synthesized amphetamine and tested it in asthma patients in 1929 . the drug proved to have only modest anti-asthma effects , but produced sensations of exhilaration and palpitations . amphetamine was developed by smith , kline and french as a nasal decongestant under the trade name benzedrine inhaler . amphetamine was eventually developed for the treatment of narcolepsy , post-encepheletic parkinsonism , and mood elevation in depression and other psychiatric indications . it received approval as a new and nonofficial remedy from the american medical association for these uses in 1937 and remained in common use for depression until the development of tricyclic antidepressants in the 1960s .
mieszko i of poland ( c . 935 - 25 may 992 ) established an elite knightly retinue from within his army , which he depended upon for success in uniting the lekhitic tribes and preserving the unity of his state . documented proof exists of mieszko i 's successors utilizing such a retinue , as well .
tito carried on numerous affairs and was married several times . in 1918 he was brought to omsk , russia , as a prisoner of war . there he met pelagija belousova who was then thirteen ; he married her a year later , and she moved with him to yugoslavia . pelagija bore him five children but only their son zarko leon ( born 4 february , 1924 ) survived . when tito was jailed in 1928 , she returned to russia . after the divorce in 1936 she later remarried .
further developments include new lignin glue applications , recyclable food packaging , rubber tire replacement applications , anti-bacterial medical agents , and high strength fabrics or composites . as scientists and engineers further learn and develop new techniques to extract various components from wood , or alternatively to modify wood , for example by adding components to wood , new more advanced products will appear on the marketplace . moisture content electronic monitoring can also enhance next generation wood protection .
the nazi regime under adolf hitler came to power in 1933 , and along with mussolini 's italy sought to gain control of the continent by the second world war . following the allied victory in the second world war , europe was divided by the iron curtain . the countries in southeastern europe were dominated by the soviet union and became communist states . the major non-communist southern european countries joined a us-led military alliance ( nato ) and formed the european economic community amongst themselves . the countries in the soviet sphere of influence joined the military alliance known as the warsaw pact and the economic bloc called comecon . yugoslavia was neutal .
various ecumenical movements have attempted cooperation or reorganization of the various divided protestant denominations , according to various models of union , but divisions continue to outpace unions , as there is no overarching authority to which any of the churches owe allegiance , which can authoritatively define the faith . most denominations share common beliefs in the major aspects of the christian faith while differing in many secondary doctrines , although what is major and what is secondary is a matter of idiosyncratic belief .
though still predominantly green , post-2004 series incorporate other colors to better distinguish different denominations . as a result of a 2008 decision in an accessibility lawsuit filed by the american council of the blind , the bureau of engraving and printing is planning to implement a raised tactile feature in the next redesign of each note , except the $ 1 and the version of the $ 100 bill already in process . it also plans larger , higher-contrast numerals , more color differences , and distribution of currency readers to assist the visually impaired during the transition period .
presbyterianism is historically a confessional tradition . this has two implications . the obvious one is that confessional churches express their faith in the form of " confessions of faith , " which have some level of authoritative status . however this is based on a more subtle point : in confessional churches , theology is not solely an individual matter . while individuals are encouraged to understand scripture , and may challenge the current institutional understanding , theology is carried out by the community as a whole . it is this community understanding of theology that is expressed in confessions .
mendes revealed that production would begin on 8 december 2014 at pinewood studios , with filming taking seven months . mendes also confirmed several filming locations , including london , mexico city and rome . van hoytema shot the film on kodak 35 mm film stock . early filming took place at pinewood studios , and around london , with scenes variously featuring craig and harris at bond 's flat , and craig and kinnear travelling down the river thames .
for those that remained under the ottoman empire 's millet system , religion was the defining characteristic of national groups ( milletler ) , so the exonym " greeks " ( rumlar from the name rhomaioi ) was applied by the ottomans to all members of the orthodox church , regardless of their language or ethnic origin . the greek speakers were the only ethnic group to actually call themselves romioi , ( as opposed to being so named by others ) and , at least those educated , considered their ethnicity ( genos ) to be hellenic . there were , however , many greeks who escaped the second-class status of christians inherent in the ottoman millet system , according to which muslims were explicitly awarded senior status and preferential treatment . these greeks either emigrated , particularly to their fellow greek orthodox protector , the russian empire , or simply converted to islam , often only very superficially and whilst remaining crypto-christian . the most notable examples of large-scale conversion to turkish islam among those today defined as greek muslims - excluding those who had to convert as a matter of course on being recruited through the devshirme - were to be found in crete ( cretan turks ) , greek macedonia ( for example among the vallahades of western macedonia ) , and among pontic greeks in the pontic alps and armenian highlands . several ottoman sultans and princes were also of part greek origin , with mothers who were either greek concubines or princesses from byzantine noble families , one famous example being sultan selim the grim , whose mother gulbahar hatun was a pontic greek .
the idea of self-concept is known as the ability of a person to have opinions and beliefs that are defined confidently , consistent and stable . early in adolescence , cognitive developments result in greater self-awareness , greater awareness of others and their thoughts and judgments , the ability to think about abstract , future possibilities , and the ability to consider multiple possibilities at once . as a result , adolescents experience a significant shift from the simple , concrete , and global self-descriptions typical of young children ; as children , they defined themselves by physical traits whereas as adolescents , they define themselves based on their values , thoughts , and opinions .
most of the enlargement of the primate brain comes from a massive expansion of the cerebral cortex , especially the prefrontal cortex and the parts of the cortex involved in vision . the visual processing network of primates includes at least 30 distinguishable brain areas , with a complex web of interconnections . it has been estimated that visual processing areas occupy more than half of the total surface of the primate neocortex . the prefrontal cortex carries out functions that include planning , working memory , motivation , attention , and executive control . it takes up a much larger proportion of the brain for primates than for other species , and an especially large fraction of the human brain .
solar energy is radiant light and heat from the sun harnessed using a range of ever-evolving technologies such as solar heating , photovoltaics , solar thermal energy , solar architecture and artificial photosynthesis .
beyond combat flight crew personnel , perhaps the most dangerous usaf jobs are explosive ordnance disposal ( eod ) , combat rescue officer , pararescue , security forces , combat control , combat weather , tactical air control party , and afosi agents , who deploy with infantry and special operations units who disarm bombs , rescue downed or isolated personnel , call in air strikes and set up landing zones in forward locations . most of these are enlisted positions augmented by a smaller number of commissioned officers . other career fields that have seen increasing exposure to combat include civil engineers , vehicle operators , and air force office of special investigations ( afosi ) personnel .
one big impetus for the development of the ac radio format was that , when rock and roll music first became popular in the mid-1950s , many more conservative radio stations wanted to continue to play current hit songs while shying away from rock . these middle of the road ( or " mor " ) stations also frequently included older , pre-rock-era adult standards and big band titles to further appeal to adult listeners who had grown up with those songs .
central , western , and balearic differ in the lexical incidence of stressed / e / and / ɛ / . usually , words with / ɛ / in central catalan correspond to / ə / in balearic and / e / in western catalan . words with / e / in balearic almost always have / e / in central and western catalan as well . [ vague ] as a result , central catalan has a much higher incidence of / e / .
the first english coffeehouse opened in oxford in 1650 . brian cowan said that oxford coffeehouses developed into " penny universities , " offering a locus of learning that was less formal than structured institutions . these penny universities occupied a significant position in oxford academic life , as they were frequented by those consequently referred to as the " virtuosi , " who conducted their research on some of the resulting premises . according to cowan , " the coffeehouse was a place for like-minded scholars to congregate , to read , as well as learn from and to debate with each other , but was emphatically not a university institution , and the discourse there was of a far different order than any university tutorial . "
the indonesian archipelago is split by the wallace line . this line runs along what is now known to be a tectonic plate boundary , and separates asian ( western ) species from australasian ( eastern ) species . the islands between java / borneo and papua form a mixed zone , where both types occur , known as wallacea . as the pace of development accelerates and populations continue to expand in southeast asia , concern has increased regarding the impact of human activity on the region 's environment . a significant portion of southeast asia , however , has not changed greatly and remains an unaltered home to wildlife . the nations of the region , with only few exceptions , have become aware of the need to maintain forest cover not only to prevent soil erosion but to preserve the diversity of flora and fauna . indonesia , for example , has created an extensive system of national parks and preserves for this purpose . even so , such species as the javan rhinoceros face extinction , with only a handful of the animals remaining in western java .
stanley crouch wrote in a new york daily news piece " obama 's mother is of white u.s. stock . his father is a black kenyan , " in a column entitled " what obama isn 't : black like me . " during the 2008 campaign , the african-american columnist david ehrenstein of the la times accused white liberals of flocking to obama because he was a " magic negro , " a term that refers to a black person with no past who simply appears to assist the mainstream white ( as cultural protagonists / drivers ) agenda . ehrenstein went on to say " he 's there to assuage white ' guilt ' they feel over the role of slavery and racial segregation in american history . "
the 50th anniversary of his death was celebrated on 3 june 2013 by pope francis , who visited his tomb and prayed there , then addressing the gathered crowd and spoke about the late pope . the people that gathered there at the tomb were from bergamo , the province where the late pope came from . a month later , on 5 july 2013 , francis approved pope john xxiii for canonization , along with pope john paul ii without the traditional second miracle required . instead , francis based this decision on john xxiii 's merits for the second vatican council . on sunday , 27 april 2014 , john xxiii and pope john paul ii were declared saints on divine mercy sunday .
tibet ( i / tᵻˈbɛt / ; wylie : bod , pronounced [ pʰø  ʔ ] ; chinese : 西藏 ; pinyin : xizang ) is a region on the tibetan plateau in asia . it is the traditional homeland of the tibetan people as well as some other ethnic groups such as monpa , qiang and lhoba peoples and is now also inhabited by considerable numbers of han chinese and hui people . tibet is the highest region on earth , with an average elevation of 4,900 metres ( 16,000 ft ) . the highest elevation in tibet is mount everest , earth 's highest mountain rising 8,848 m ( 29,029 ft ) above sea level .
yale traces its beginnings to " an act for liberty to erect a collegiate school , " passed by the general court of the colony of connecticut on october 9 , 1701 , while meeting in new haven . the act was an effort to create an institution to train ministers and lay leadership for connecticut . soon thereafter , a group of ten congregationalist ministers : samuel andrew , thomas buckingham , israel chauncy , samuel mather , rev. james noyes ii ( son of james noyes ) , james pierpont , abraham pierson , noadiah russell , joseph webb and timothy woodbridge , all alumni of harvard , met in the study of reverend samuel russell in branford , connecticut , to pool their books to form the school 's library . the group , led by james pierpont , is now known as " the founders .

with his mazurkas and polonaises , chopin has been credited with introducing to music a new sense of nationalism . schumann , in his 1836 review of the piano concertos , highlighted the composer 's strong feelings for his native poland , writing that " now that the poles are in deep mourning [ after the failure of the november 1830 rising ] , their appeal to us artists is even stronger ... if the mighty autocrat in the north [ i.e. nicholas i of russia ] could know that in chopin 's works , in the simple strains of his mazurkas , there lurks a dangerous enemy , he would place a ban on his music . chopin 's works are cannon buried in flowers ! " the biography of chopin published in 1863 under the name of franz liszt ( but probably written by carolyne zu sayn-wittgenstein ) claims that chopin " must be ranked first among the first musicians ... individualizing in themselves the poetic sense of an entire nation . "
the total length of roads in nepal is recorded to be ( 17,182 km ( 10,676 mi ) ) , as of 2003-04 . this fairly large network has helped the economic development of the country , particularly in the fields of agriculture , horticulture , vegetable farming , industry and also tourism . in view of the hilly terrain , transportation takes place in kathmandu are mainly by road and air . kathmandu is connected by the tribhuvan highway to the south , prithvi highway to the west and araniko highway to the north . the bp highway , connecting kathmandu to the eastern part of nepal is under construction .
lancashire had a lively culture of choral and classical music , with very large numbers of local church choirs from the 17th century , leading to the foundation of local choral societies from the mid-18th century , often particularly focused on performances of the music of handel and his contemporaries . it also played a major part in the development of brass bands which emerged in the county , particularly in the textile and coalfield areas , in the 19th century . the first open competition for brass bands was held at manchester in 1853 , and continued annually until the 1980s . the vibrant brass band culture of the area made an important contribution to the foundation and staffing of the halle orchestra from 1857 , the oldest extant professional orchestra in the united kingdom . the same local musical tradition produced eminent figures such as sir william walton ( 1902-88 ) , son of an oldham choirmaster and music teacher , sir thomas beecham ( 1879-1961 ) , born in st. helens , who began his career by conducting local orchestras and alan rawsthorne ( 1905-71 ) born in haslingden . the conductor david atherton , co-founder of the london sinfonietta , was born in blackpool in 1944 . lancashire also produced more populist figures , such as early musical theatre composer leslie stuart ( 1863-1928 ) , born in southport , who began his musical career as organist of salford cathedral .
beyonce has worked with pepsi since 2002 , and in 2004 appeared in a gladiator-themed commercial with britney spears , pink , and enrique iglesias . in 2012 , beyonce signed a $ 50 million deal to endorse pepsi . the center for science in the public interest ( cspinet ) wrote beyonce an open letter asking her to reconsider the deal because of the unhealthiness of the product and to donate the proceeds to a medical organisation . nevertheless , netbase found that beyonce 's campaign was the most talked about endorsement in april 2013 , with a 70 per cent positive audience response to the commercial and print ads .
economic sanctions against iran , such as the embargo against iranian crude oil , have affected the economy . sanctions have led to a steep fall in the value of the rial , and as of april 2013 one us dollar is worth 36,000 rial , compared with 16,000 in early 2012 . following a successful implementation of the 2015 nuclear and sanctions relief deal , the resulting benefits might not be distributed evenly across the iranian economy as political elites such as the islamic revolutionary guard corps have garnered more resources and economic interests .
the golden boot is awarded to the top premier league scorer at the end of each season . former blackburn rovers and newcastle united striker alan shearer holds the record for most premier league goals with 260 . twenty-four players have reached the 100-goal mark . since the first premier league season in 1992-93 , 14 different players from 10 different clubs have won or shared the top scorers title . thierry henry won his fourth overall scoring title by scoring 27 goals in the 2005-06 season . andrew cole and alan shearer hold the record for most goals in a season ( 34 ) - for newcastle and blackburn respectively . ryan giggs of manchester united holds the record for scoring goals in consecutive seasons , having scored in the first 21 seasons of the league .

his father 's career as a university professor influenced friedrich 's goals later in life . both of his grandfathers , who lived long enough for friedrich to know them , were scholars . franz von juraschek was a leading economist in austria-hungary and a close friend of eugen bohm von bawerk , one of the founders of the austrian school of economics . von juraschek was a statistician and was later employed by the austrian government . friedrich 's paternal grandfather , gustav edler von hayek , taught natural sciences at the imperial realobergymnasium ( secondary school ) in vienna . he wrote systematic works in biology , some of which are relatively well known .
a corrupt dictatorship typically results in many years of general hardship and suffering for the vast majority of citizens as civil society and the rule of law disintegrate . in addition , corrupt dictators routinely ignore economic and social problems in their quest to amass ever more wealth and power .
the bipolar transistor was invented in 1947 . from 1955 onwards transistors replaced vacuum tubes in computer designs , giving rise to the " second generation " of computers . compared to vacuum tubes , transistors have many advantages : they are smaller , and require less power than vacuum tubes , so give off less heat . silicon junction transistors were much more reliable than vacuum tubes and had longer , indefinite , service life . transistorized computers could contain tens of thousands of binary logic circuits in a relatively compact space .
in 1353 bern joined the swiss confederacy , becoming one of the eight cantons of the formative period of 1353 to 1481 . bern invaded and conquered aargau in 1415 and vaud in 1536 , as well as other smaller territories ; thereby becoming the largest city-state north of the alps , by the 18th century comprising most of what is today the canton of bern and the canton of vaud .
the elimination of wolves from yellowstone national park had profound impacts on the trophic pyramid . without predation , herbivores began to over-graze many woody browse species , affecting the area 's plant populations . in addition , wolves often kept animals from grazing in riparian areas , which protected beavers from having their food sources encroached upon . the removal of wolves had a direct effect on beaver populations , as their habitat became territory for grazing . furthermore , predation keeps hydrological features such as creeks and streams in normal working order . increased browsing on willows and conifers along blacktail creek due to a lack of predation caused channel incision because they helped slow the water down and hold the soil in place .
the suez crisis very publicly exposed britain 's limitations to the world and confirmed britain 's decline on the world stage , demonstrating that henceforth it could no longer act without at least the acquiescence , if not the full support , of the united states . the events at suez wounded british national pride , leading one mp to describe it as " britain 's waterloo " and another to suggest that the country had become an " american satellite . " margaret thatcher later described the mindset she believed had befallen the british political establishment as " suez syndrome , " from which britain did not recover until the successful recapture of the falkland islands from argentina in 1982 .
articles 46-53 of the vienna convention on the law of treaties set out the only ways that treaties can be invalidated - considered unenforceable and void under international law . a treaty will be invalidated due to either the circumstances by which a state party joined the treaty , or due to the content of the treaty itself . invalidation is separate from withdrawal , suspension , or termination ( addressed above ) , which all involve an alteration in the consent of the parties of a previously valid treaty rather than the invalidation of that consent in the first place .

liberia scored a 3.3 on a scale from 10 ( highly clean ) to 0 ( highly corrupt ) on the 2010 corruption perceptions index . this gave it a ranking 87th of 178 countries worldwide and 11th of 47 in sub-saharan africa . this score represented a significant improvement since 2007 , when the country scored 2.1 and ranked 150th of 180 countries . when seeking attention of a selection of service [ clarification needed ] providers , 89 % of liberians had to pay a bribe , the highest national percentage in the world according to the organization 's 2010 global corruption barometer .
in a tumbling pass , dismount or vault , landing is the final phase , following take off and flight this is a critical skill in terms of execution in competition scores , general performance , and injury occurrence . without the necessary magnitude of energy dissipation during impact , the risk of sustaining injuries during somersaulting increases . these injuries commonly occur at the lower extremities such as : cartilage lesions , ligament tears , and bone bruises / fractures . to avoid such injuries , and to receive a high performance score , proper technique must be used by the gymnast . " the subsequent ground contact or impact landing phase must be achieved using a safe , aesthetic and well-executed double foot landing . " a successful landing in gymnastics is classified as soft , meaning the knee and hip joints are at greater than 63 degrees of flexion .
in 1824 the british government instructed the governor of new south wales thomas brisbane to occupy norfolk island as a place to send " the worst description of convicts . " its remoteness , previously seen as a disadvantage , was now viewed as an asset for the detention of recalcitrant male prisoners . the convicts detained have long been assumed to be a hardcore of recidivists , or ' doubly-convicted capital respites ' - that is , men transported to australia who committed fresh colonial crimes for which they were sentenced to death , and were spared the gallows on condition of life at norfolk island . however , a recent study has demonstrated , utilising a database of 6,458 norfolk island convicts , that the reality was somewhat different : more than half were detained at norfolk island without ever receiving a colonial conviction , and only 15 % had been reprieved from a death sentence . furthermore , the overwhelming majority of convicts sent to norfolk island had committed non-violent property sentences , and the average length of detention was three years .
early hdtv commercial experiments , such as nhk 's muse , required over four times the bandwidth of a standard-definition broadcast . despite efforts made to reduce analog hdtv to about twice the bandwidth of sdtv , these television formats were still distributable only by satellite .
two annual productions are especially notable : the waa-mu show , and the dolphin show . waa-mu is an original musical , written and produced almost entirely by students . children 's theater is represented on campus by griffin 's tale and purple crayon players . its umbrella organization - the student theatre coalition , or stuco , organizes nine student theatre companies , multiple performance groups and more than sixty independent productions each year . many northwestern alumni have used these productions as stepping stones to successful television and film careers . chicago 's lookingglass theatre company , for example , which began life in the great room in jones residential college , was founded in 1988 by several alumni , including david schwimmer ; in 2011 , it won the regional tony award .
oklahoma is in the nation 's middle percentile in per capita spending on the arts , ranking 17th , and contains more than 300 museums . the philbrook museum of tulsa is considered one of the top 50 fine art museums in the united states , and the sam noble oklahoma museum of natural history in norman , one of the largest university-based art and history museums in the country , documents the natural history of the region . the collections of thomas gilcrease are housed in the gilcrease museum of tulsa , which also holds the world 's largest , most comprehensive collection of art and artifacts of the american west .
in johannine " agent christology " the submission of jesus to crucifixion is a sacrifice made as an agent of god or servant of god , for the sake of eventual victory . this builds on the salvific theme of the gospel of john which begins in john 1 : 29 with john the baptist 's proclamation : " the lamb of god who takes away the sins of the world . " further reinforcement of the concept is provided in revelation 21 : 14 where the " lamb slain but standing " is the only one worthy of handling the scroll ( i.e. the book ) containing the names of those who are to be saved .
relatively insensitive film , with a correspondingly lower speed index , requires more exposure to light to produce the same image density as a more sensitive film , and is thus commonly termed a slow film . highly sensitive films are correspondingly termed fast films . in both digital and film photography , the reduction of exposure corresponding to use of higher sensitivities generally leads to reduced image quality ( via coarser film grain or higher image noise of other types ) . in short , the higher the sensitivity , the grainier the image will be . ultimately sensitivity is limited by the quantum efficiency of the film or sensor .
one commentator has observed that , notwithstanding the high unemployment resulting from the loss of full passports during 1981-2002 , the level of loyalty to the british monarchy by the st helena population is probably not exceeded in any other part of the world . king george vi is the only reigning monarch to have visited the island . this was in 1947 when the king , accompanied by queen elizabeth ( later the queen mother ) , princess elizabeth ( later queen elizabeth ii ) and princess margaret were travelling to south africa . prince philip arrived at st helena in 1957 and then his son prince andrew visited as a member of the armed forces in 1984 and his sister the princess royal arrived in 2002 .

the professionals soon displaced the amateur ex-public schoolboys . bermuda 's role as the primary royal navy base in the western hemisphere , with an army garrison to match , ensured that the naval and military officers quickly introduced the newly formalised sports to bermuda , including cricket , football , rugby football , and even tennis and rowing ( rowing did not adapt well from british rivers to the stormy atlantic . the officers soon switched to sail racing , founding the royal bermuda yacht club ) . once these sports reached bermuda , they were eagerly adopted by bermudians .
the contemporary liberal party generally advocates economic liberalism ( see new right ) . historically , the party has supported a higher degree of economic protectionism and interventionism than it has in recent decades . however , from its foundation the party has identified itself as anti-socialist . strong opposition to socialism and communism in australia and abroad was one of its founding principles . the party 's founder and longest-serving leader robert menzies envisaged that australia 's middle class would form its main constituency .
some estonians , unwilling to side directly with the nazis , joined the finnish army ( which was allied with the nazis ) to fight against the soviet union . the finnish infantry regiment 200 ( estonian : soomepoisid ) was formed out of estonian volunteers in finland . although many estonians were recruited into the german armed forces ( including estonian waffen-ss ) , the majority of them did so only in 1944 when the threat of a new invasion of estonia by the red army had become imminent . in january 1944 estonia was again facing the prospect of invasion from the red army and the last legitimate prime minister of the republic of estonia ( according to the constitution of the republic of estonia ) delivered a radio address asking all able-bodied men born from 1904 through 1923 to report for military service . the call resulted in around 38,000 new enlistments and several thousand estonians who had joined the finnish army came back to join the newly formed territorial defense force , assigned to defend estonia against the soviet advance . it was hoped [ by whom ? ] that by engaging in such a war estonia would be able to attract western support for estonian independence .

the third great awakening refers to a hypothetical historical period that was marked by religious activism in american history and spans the late 1850s to the early 20th century . it affected pietistic protestant denominations and had a strong element of social activism . it gathered strength from the postmillennial belief that the second coming of christ would occur after mankind had reformed the entire earth . it was affiliated with the social gospel movement , which applied christianity to social issues and gained its force from the awakening , as did the worldwide missionary movement . new groupings emerged , such as the holiness , nazarene , and christian science movements .
new york is the most important source of political fundraising in the united states , as four of the top five zip codes in the nation for political contributions are in manhattan . the top zip code , 10021 on the upper east side , generated the most money for the 2004 presidential campaigns of george w. bush and john kerry . the city has a strong imbalance of payments with the national and state governments . it receives 83 cents in services for every $ 1 it sends to the federal government in taxes ( or annually sends $ 11.4 billion more than it receives back ) . the city also sends an additional $ 11 billion more each year to the state of new york than it receives back .
all of britain 's campaigns against new france succeeded in 1759 , part of what became known as an annus mirabilis . fort niagara and fort carillon on 8 july 1758 fell to sizable british forces , cutting off french frontier forts further west . on 13 september 1759 , following a three-month siege of quebec , general james wolfe defeated the french on the plains of abraham outside the city . the french staged a counteroffensive in the spring of 1760 , with initial success at the battle of sainte-foy , but they were unable to retake quebec , due to british naval superiority following the battle of neuville . the french forces retreated to montreal , where on 8 september they surrendered to overwhelming british numerical superiority .
the word ottoman is a historical anglicisation of the name of osman i , the founder of the empire and of the ruling house of osman ( also known as the ottoman dynasty ) . osman 's name in turn was derived from the persian form of the name ʿuthman عثمان of ultimately arabic origin . in ottoman turkish , the empire was referred to as devlet-i ʿaliyye-yi ʿosmaniyye ( دولت عليه عثمانیه ) , ( literally " the supreme state of the ottomans " ) or alternatively osmanlı devleti ( عثمانلى دولتى ) . [ dn 5 ] in modern turkish , it is known as osmanlı imparatorlugu ( " ottoman empire " ) or osmanlı devleti ( " the ottoman state " ) .
changing clocks and dst rules has a direct economic cost , entailing extra work to support remote meetings , computer applications and the like . for example , a 2007 north american rule change cost an estimated $ 500 million to $ 1 billion , and utah state university economist william f. shughart ii has estimated the lost opportunity cost at around $ 1.7 billion usd . although it has been argued that clock shifts correlate with decreased economic efficiency , and that in 2000 the daylight-saving effect implied an estimated one-day loss of $ 31 billion on us stock exchanges , the estimated numbers depend on the methodology . the results have been disputed , and the original authors have refuted the points raised by disputers .
the aravalli range and the lands to the east and southeast of the range are generally more fertile and better watered . this region is home to the kathiarbar-gir dry deciduous forests ecoregion , with tropical dry broadleaf forests that include teak , acacia , and other trees . the hilly vagad region , home to the cities of dungarpur and banswara lies in southernmost rajasthan , on the border with gujarat and madhya pradesh . with the exception of mount abu , vagad is the wettest region in rajasthan , and the most heavily forested . north of vagad lies the mewar region , home to the cities of udaipur and chittaurgarh . the hadoti region lies to the southeast , on the border with madhya pradesh . north of hadoti and mewar lies the dhundhar region , home to the state capital of jaipur . mewat , the easternmost region of rajasthan , borders haryana and uttar pradesh . eastern and southeastern rajasthan is drained by the banas and chambal rivers , tributaries of the ganges .
the london underground in england is one of the few networks that uses a four-rail system . the additional rail carries the electrical return that , on third rail and overhead networks , is provided by the running rails . on the london underground , a top-contact third rail is beside the track , energized at + 420v dc , and a top-contact fourth rail is located centrally between the running rails at − 210v dc , which combine to provide a traction voltage of 630v dc . london underground is now upgrading its fourth rail system to 750v dc with a positive conductor rail energised to + 500v dc and a negative conductor rail energised to -250v dc . however , many older sections in tunnels are still energised to 630v dc . the same system was used for milan 's earliest underground line , milan metro 's line 1 , whose more recent lines use an overhead catenary or a third rail .
outsourcing production to low wage countries like bangladesh , china , india and sri lanka became possible when the multi fibre agreement ( mfa ) was abolished . the mfa , which placed quotas on textiles imports , was deemed a protectionist measure . [ citation needed ] globalization is often quoted as the single most contributing factor to the poor working conditions of garment workers . although many countries recognize treaties like the international labor organization , which attempt to set standards for worker safety and rights , many countries have made exceptions to certain parts of the treaties or failed to thoroughly enforce them . india for example has not ratified sections 87 and 92 of the treaty .

a federal trade commission report issued in 1958 attempted to quantify the effect of antibiotic development on american public health . the report found that over the period 1946-1955 , there was a 42 % drop in the incidence of diseases for which antibiotics were effective and only a 20 % drop in those for which antibiotics were not effective . the report concluded that " it appears that the use of antibiotics , early diagnosis , and other factors have limited the epidemic spread and thus the number of these diseases which have occurred . " the study further examined mortality rates for eight common diseases for which antibiotics offered effective therapy ( syphilis , tuberculosis , dysentery , scarlet fever , whooping cough , meningococcal infections , and pneumonia ) , and found a 56 % decline over the same period . notable among these was a 75 % decline in deaths due to tuberculosis .
in ireland , pubs are known for their atmosphere or " craic . " in irish , a pub is referred to as teach tabhairne ( " tavernhouse " ) or teach oil ( " drinkinghouse " ) . live music , either sessions of traditional irish music or varieties of modern popular music , is frequently featured in the pubs of ireland . pubs in northern ireland are largely identical to their counterparts in the republic of ireland except for the lack of spirit grocers . a side effect of " the troubles " was that the lack of a tourist industry meant that a higher proportion of traditional bars have survived the wholesale refitting of irish pub interiors in the ' english style ' in the 1950s and 1960s . new zealand sports a number of irish pubs .
according to orthodox judaism , jewish law today is based on the commandments in the torah , as viewed through the discussions and debates contained in classical rabbinic literature , especially the mishnah and the talmud . orthodox judaism thus holds that the halakha represents the " will of god , " either directly , or as closely to directly as possible . the laws are from the word of god in the torah , using a set of rules also revealed by god to moses on mount sinai , and have been derived with the utmost accuracy and care , and thus the oral law is considered to be no less the word of god . if some of the details of jewish law may have been lost over the millennia , they were reconstructed in accordance with internally consistent rules ; see the 13 rules by which jewish law was derived .
universal owned the rights to the " oswald the lucky rabbit " character , although walt disney and ub iwerks had created oswald , and their films had enjoyed a successful theatrical run . after charles mintz had unsuccessfully demanded that disney accept a lower fee for producing the property , mintz produced the films with his own group of animators . instead , disney and iwerks created mickey mouse who in 1928 stared in the first " sync " sound animated short , steamboat willie . this moment effectively launched walt disney studios ' foothold , while universal became a minor player in film animation . universal subsequently severed its link to mintz and formed its own in-house animation studio to produce oswald cartoons headed by walter lantz .

at least where the digital audio tracks were concerned , the sound quality was unsurpassed at the time compared to consumer videotape , but the quality of the analog soundtracks varied greatly depending on the disc and , sometimes , the player . many early and lower-end ld players had poor analog audio components , and many early discs had poorly mastered analog audio tracks , making digital soundtracks in any form most desirable to serious enthusiasts . early discovision and laserdisc titles lacked the digital audio option , but many of those movies received digital sound in later re-issues by universal , and the quality of analog audio tracks generally got far better as time went on . many discs that had originally carried old analog stereo tracks received new dolby stereo and dolby surround tracks instead , often in addition to digital tracks , helping boost sound quality . later analog discs also applied cx noise reduction , which improved the signal-noise ratio of their audio .
melbourne is an international cultural centre , with cultural endeavours spanning major events and festivals , drama , musicals , comedy , music , art , architecture , literature , film and television . the climate , waterfront location and nightlife make it one of the most vibrant destinations in australia . for five years in a row ( as of 2015 ) it has held the top position in a survey by the economist intelligence unit of the world 's most liveable cities on the basis of a number of attributes which include its broad cultural offerings . the city celebrates a wide variety of annual cultural events and festivals of all types , including australia 's largest free community festival - moomba , the melbourne international arts festival , melbourne international film festival , melbourne international comedy festival and the melbourne fringe festival . the culture of the city is an important drawcard for tourists , of which just under two million international overnight visitors and 57.7 million domestic overnight visited during the year ending march 2014 .

interspecific crop diversity is , in part , responsible for offering variety in what we eat . intraspecific diversity , the variety of alleles within a single species , also offers us choice in our diets . if a crop fails in a monoculture , we rely on agricultural diversity to replant the land with something new . if a wheat crop is destroyed by a pest we may plant a hardier variety of wheat the next year , relying on intraspecific diversity . we may forgo wheat production in that area and plant a different species altogether , relying on interspecific diversity . even an agricultural society which primarily grows monocultures , relies on biodiversity at some point .
the empire was established in 1336 by harihara i and his brother bukka raya i of sangama dynasty . the empire rose to prominence as a culmination of attempts by the southern powers to ward off islamic invasions by the end of the 13th century . the empire is named after its capital city of vijayanagara , whose ruins surround present day hampi , now a world heritage site in karnataka , india . the empire 's legacy includes many monuments spread over south india , the best known of which is the group at hampi . the previous temple building traditions in south india came together in the vijayanagara architecture style . the mingling of all faiths and vernaculars inspired architectural innovation of hindu temple construction , first in the deccan and later in the dravidian idioms using the local granite . south indian mathematics flourished under the protection of the vijayanagara empire in kerala . the south indian mathematician madhava of sangamagrama founded the famous kerala school of astronomy and mathematics in the 14th century which produced a lot of great south indian mathematicians like parameshvara , nilakantha somayaji and jyesthadeva in medieval south india . efficient administration and vigorous overseas trade brought new technologies such as water management systems for irrigation . the empire 's patronage enabled fine arts and literature to reach new heights in kannada , telugu , tamil and sanskrit , while carnatic music evolved into its current form . the vijayanagara empire created an epoch in south indian history that transcended regionalism by promoting hinduism as a unifying factor . the empire reached its peak during the rule of sri krishnadevaraya when vijayanagara armies were consistently victorious . the empire annexed areas formerly under the sultanates in the northern deccan and the territories in the eastern deccan , including kalinga , while simultaneously maintaining control over all its subordinates in the south . many important monuments were either completed or commissioned during the time of krishna deva raya . vijayanagara went into decline after the defeat in the battle of talikota ( 1565 ) .
the largest mammal to live in the highest altitudes are the alpine ibex , which have been sighted as high as 3,000 m ( 9,843 ft ) . the ibex live in caves and descend to eat the succulent alpine grasses . classified as antelopes , chamois are smaller than ibex and found throughout the alps , living above the tree line and are common in the entire alpine range . areas of the eastern alps are still home to brown bears . in switzerland the canton of bern was named for the bears but the last bear is recorded as having been killed in 1792 above kleine scheidegg by three hunters from grindelwald .

seattle was also the home base of impresario alexander pantages who , starting in 1902 , opened a number of theaters in the city exhibiting vaudeville acts and silent movies . his activities soon expanded , and the thrifty greek went on and became one of america 's greatest theater and movie tycoons . between pantages and his rival john considine , seattle was for a while the western united states ' vaudeville mecca . b. marcus priteca , the scottish-born and seattle-based architect , built several theaters for pantages , including some in seattle . the theaters he built for pantages in seattle have been either demolished or converted to other uses , but many other theaters survive in other cities of the u.s. , often retaining the pantages name ; seattle 's surviving paramount theatre , on which he collaborated , was not a pantages theater .
the biographical tradition asserts that virgil began the hexameter eclogues ( or bucolics ) in 42 bc and it is thought that the collection was published around 39-38 bc , although this is controversial . the eclogues ( from the greek for " selections " ) are a group of ten poems roughly modeled on the bucolic hexameter poetry ( " pastoral poetry " ) of the hellenistic poet theocritus . after his victory in the battle of philippi in 42 bc , fought against the army led by the assassins of julius caesar , octavian tried to pay off his veterans with land expropriated from towns in northern italy , supposedly including , according to the tradition , an estate near mantua belonging to virgil . the loss of his family farm and the attempt through poetic petitions to regain his property have traditionally been seen as virgil 's motives in the composition of the eclogues . this is now thought to be an unsupported inference from interpretations of the eclogues . in eclogues 1 and 9 , virgil indeed dramatizes the contrasting feelings caused by the brutality of the land expropriations through pastoral idiom , but offers no indisputable evidence of the supposed biographic incident . while some readers have identified the poet himself with various characters and their vicissitudes , whether gratitude by an old rustic to a new god ( ecl . 1 ) , frustrated love by a rustic singer for a distant boy ( his master 's pet , ecl . 2 ) , or a master singer 's claim to have composed several eclogues ( ecl . 5 ) , modern scholars largely reject such efforts to garner biographical details from works of fiction , preferring to interpret an author 's characters and themes as illustrations of contemporary life and thought . the ten eclogues present traditional pastoral themes with a fresh perspective . eclogues 1 and 9 address the land confiscations and their effects on the italian countryside . 2 and 3 are pastoral and erotic , discussing both homosexual love ( ecl . 2 ) and attraction toward people of any gender ( ecl . 3 ) . eclogue 4 , addressed to asinius pollio , the so-called " messianic eclogue " uses the imagery of the golden age in connection with the birth of a child ( who the child was meant to be has been subject to debate ) . 5 and 8 describe the myth of daphnis in a song contest , 6 , the cosmic and mythological song of silenus ; 7 , a heated poetic contest , and 10 the sufferings of the contemporary elegiac poet cornelius gallus . virgil is credited [ by whom ? ] in the eclogues with establishing arcadia as a poetic ideal that still resonates in western literature and visual arts and setting the stage for the development of latin pastoral by calpurnius siculus , nemesianus , and later writers .
thermographic cameras detect radiation in the infrared range of the electromagnetic spectrum ( roughly 900-14,000 nanometers or 0.9-14 μm ) and produce images of that radiation . since infrared radiation is emitted by all objects based on their temperatures , according to the black body radiation law , thermography makes it possible to " see " one 's environment with or without visible illumination . the amount of radiation emitted by an object increases with temperature , therefore thermography allows one to see variations in temperature ( hence the name ) .
architecture ( latin architectura , from the greek αρχιτεκτων arkhitekton " architect , " from αρχι- " chief " and τεκτων " builder " ) is both the process and the product of planning , designing , and constructing buildings and other physical structures . architectural works , in the material form of buildings , are often perceived as cultural symbols and as works of art . historical civilizations are often identified with their surviving architectural achievements .
in december 1993 , the famicom received a similar redesign . it also loads cartridges through a covered slot on the top of the unit and uses non-hardwired controllers . because hvc-101 used composite video output instead of being rf only like the hvc-001 , nintendo marketed the newer model as the av famicom ( av仕様ファミコン , eibui shiyo famikon ? ) . since the new controllers don 't have microphones on them like the second controller on the original console , certain games such as the disk system version of the legend of zelda and raid on bungeling bay will have certain tricks that cannot be replicated when played on an hvc-101 famicom without a modded controller . however , the hvc-101 famicom is compatible with most nes controllers due to having the same controller port . nintendo had also released a 3d graphic capable headset . however , this peripheral was never released outside japan .

the " radical enlightenment " promoted the concept of separating church and state , an idea that often credited to english philosopher john locke ( 1632-1704 ) . according to his principle of the social contract , locke said that the government lacked authority in the realm of individual conscience , as this was something rational people could not cede to the government for it or others to control . for locke , this created a natural right in the liberty of conscience , which he said must therefore remain protected from any government authority .
traditionally a carnival feast was the last opportunity to eat well before the time of food shortage at the end of the winter during which one was limited to the minimum necessary . on what nowadays is called vastenavond ( the days before fasting ) all the remaining winter stores of lard , butter and meat which were left would be eaten , for it would soon start to rot and decay . the selected livestock had in fact already been slaughtered in november and the meat would be no longer preservable . all the food that had survived the winter had to be eaten to assure that everyone was fed enough to survive until the coming spring would provide new food sources .
arsenal was the first club from the south of england to join the football league , in 1893 . they entered the first division in 1904 , and have since accumulated the second most points . relegated only once , in 1913 , they continue the longest streak in the top division . in the 1930s , arsenal won five league championships and two fa cups , and another fa cup and two championships after the war . in 1970-71 , they won their first league and fa cup double . between 1988 and 2005 , they won five league titles and five fa cups , including two more doubles . they completed the 20th century with the highest average league position .
congress has the sole power to legislate for the united states . under the nondelegation doctrine , congress may not delegate its lawmaking responsibilities to any other agency . in this vein , the supreme court held in the 1998 case clinton v. city of new york that congress could not delegate a " line-item veto " to the president , by powers vested in the government by the constitution .
as the romans extended their dominance throughout the mediterranean world , their policy in general was to absorb the deities and cults of other peoples rather than try to eradicate them , since they believed that preserving tradition promoted social stability . one way that rome incorporated diverse peoples was by supporting their religious heritage , building temples to local deities that framed their theology within the hierarchy of roman religion . inscriptions throughout the empire record the side-by-side worship of local and roman deities , including dedications made by romans to local gods . by the height of the empire , numerous international deities were cultivated at rome and had been carried to even the most remote provinces , among them cybele , isis , epona , and gods of solar monism such as mithras and sol invictus , found as far north as roman britain . because romans had never been obligated to cultivate one god or one cult only , religious tolerance was not an issue in the sense that it is for competing monotheistic systems . the monotheistic rigor of judaism posed difficulties for roman policy that led at times to compromise and the granting of special exemptions , but sometimes to intractable conflict . for example , religious disputes helped cause the first jewish-roman war and the bar kokhba revolt .
according to tony sclafani from msnbc , " it 's worth noting that before madonna , most music mega-stars were guy rockers ; after her , almost all would be female singers ... when the beatles hit america , they changed the paradigm of performer from solo act to band . madonna changed it back - with an emphasis on the female . " howard kramer , curatorial director of the rock and roll hall of fame and museum , asserted that " madonna and the career she carved out for herself made possible virtually every other female pop singer to follow ... she certainly raised the standards of all of them ... she redefined what the parameters were for female performers . " according to fouz-hernandez , subsequent female singers such as britney spears , christina aguilera , kylie minogue , the spice girls , destiny 's child , jennifer lopez , and pink were like her " daughters in the very direct sense that they grew up listening to and admiring madonna , and decided they wanted to be like her . " time magazine included her in the list of the " 25 most powerful women of the past century , " where she became one of only two singers to be included , alongside aretha franklin . she also topped vh1 's lists of " 100 greatest women in music " and " 50 greatest women of the video era . "
the late cretaceous spans from 100 million to 65 million years ago . the late cretaceous featured a cooling trend that would continue on in the cenozoic period . eventually , tropics were restricted to the equator and areas beyond the tropic lines featured extreme seasonal changes in weather . dinosaurs still thrived as new species such as tyrannosaurus , ankylosaurus , triceratops and hadrosaurs dominated the food web . in the oceans , mosasaurs ruled the seas to fill the role of the ichthyosaurs , and huge plesiosaurs , such as elasmosaurus , evolved . also , the first flowering plants evolved . at the end of the cretaceous , the deccan traps and other volcanic eruptions were poisoning the atmosphere . as this was continuing , it is thought that a large meteor smashed into earth , creating the chicxulub crater in an event known as the k-t extinction , the fifth and most recent mass extinction event , in which 75 % of life on earth went extinct , including all non-avian dinosaurs . everything over 10 kilograms went extinct . the age of the dinosaurs was over .
like most of southern california , the majority of san diego 's current area was originally occupied by chaparral , a plant community made up mostly of drought-resistant shrubs . the endangered torrey pine has the bulk of its population in san diego in a stretch of protected chaparral along the coast . the steep and varied topography and proximity to the ocean create a number of different habitats within the city limits , including tidal marsh and canyons . the chaparral and coastal sage scrub habitats in low elevations along the coast are prone to wildfire , and the rates of fire have increased in the 20th century , due primarily to fires starting near the borders of urban and wild areas .
in november 2014 , sony pictures entertainment was targeted by hackers who released details of confidential e-mails between sony executives regarding several high-profile film projects . included within these were several memos relating to the production of spectre , claiming that the film was over budget , detailing early drafts of the script written by john logan , and expressing sony 's frustration with the project . eon productions later issued a statement confirming the leak of what they called " an early version of the screenplay .

international human rights organisations including human rights watch , amnesty international and the american association for the advancement of science have repeatedly documented and condemned widespread human rights violations in myanmar . the freedom in the world 2011 report by freedom house notes , " the military junta has ... suppressed nearly all basic rights ; and committed human rights abuses with impunity . " in july 2013 , the assistance association for political prisoners indicated that there were approximately 100 political prisoners being held in burmese prisons .
the cold war drew to a close in the late 1980s and the early 1990s . the united states under president ronald reagan increased diplomatic , military , and economic pressure on the soviet union , which was already suffering from severe economic stagnation . in the second half of the 1980s , newly appointed soviet leader mikhail gorbachev introduced the perestroika and glasnost reforms . the soviet union collapsed in 1991 , leaving the united states as the dominant military power , though russia retained much of the massive soviet nuclear arsenal .
in theism , god is the creator and sustainer of the universe , while in deism , god is the creator , but not the sustainer , of the universe . monotheism is the belief in the existence of one god or in the oneness of god . in pantheism , god is the universe itself . in atheism , god is not believed to exist , while god is deemed unknown or unknowable within the context of agnosticism . god has also been conceived as being incorporeal ( immaterial ) , a personal being , the source of all moral obligation , and the " greatest conceivable existent . " many notable philosophers have developed arguments for and against the existence of god .
these styles generally have either two f-shaped soundholes like a violin ( f-5 and a-5 ) , or an oval sound hole ( f-4 and a-4 and lower models ) directly under the strings . much variation exists between makers working from these archetypes , and other variants have become increasingly common . generally , in the united states , gibson f-hole f-5 mandolins and mandolins influenced by that design are strongly associated with bluegrass , while the a-style is associated other types of music , although it too is most often used for and associated with bluegrass . the f-5 's more complicated woodwork also translates into a more expensive instrument .
a variety of games for the fds were released by nintendo ( including some like super mario bros. which had already been released on cartridge ) and third party companies such as konami and taito . a few unlicensed titles were made as well . however , its limitations became quickly apparent as larger rom chips were introduced , allowing cartridges with greater than 128k of space . more advanced memory management chips ( mmc ) soon appeared and the fds quickly became obsolete . nintendo also charged developers considerable amounts of money to produce fds games , and many refused to develop for it , instead continuing to make cartridge titles . many fds disks have no dust covers ( except in some unlicensed and bootleg variants ) and are easily prone to getting dirt on the media . in addition , the drive use a belt which breaks frequently and requires invasive replacement . after only two years , the fds was discontinued , although vending booths remained in place until 1993 and nintendo continued to service drives , and to rewrite and offer replacement disks until 2003 .
in 2012 , the city contained a total of 594 high-rise buildings , with 8 under construction , 71 planned and 39 at proposal stage making the city 's skyline the second largest in australia . the cbd is dominated by modern office buildings including the rialto towers ( 1986 ) , built on the site of several grand classical victorian buildings , two of which - the rialto building ( 1889 ) designed by william pitt and the winfield building ( 1890 ) designed by charles d 'ebro and richard speight - still remain today and more recently hi-rise apartment buildings including eureka tower ( 2006 ) , which is listed as the 13th tallest residential building in the world in january 2014 .
at the same time , naval innovations led to a german domination of trade in the baltic sea and parts of eastern europe through the hanseatic league . along the trade routes , hanseatic trade stations became centers of the german culture . german town law ( stadtrecht ) was promoted by the presence of large , relatively wealthy german populations , their influence and political power . thus people who would be considered " germans , " with a common culture , language , and worldview different from that of the surrounding rural peoples , colonized trading towns as far north of present-day germany as bergen ( in norway ) , stockholm ( in sweden ) , and vyborg ( now in russia ) . the hanseatic league was not exclusively german in any ethnic sense : many towns who joined the league were outside the holy roman empire and a number of them may only loosely be characterized as german . the empire itself was not entirely german either . it had a multi-ethnic and multi-lingual structure , some of the smaller ethnicities and languages used at different times were dutch , italian , french , czech and polish .
on october 31 , 2013 , after outcry from media outlets , including heavy criticism from nick bilton of the new york times , the faa announced it will allow airlines to expand the passengers use of portable electronic devices during all phases of flight , but mobile phone calls will still be prohibited . implementation will vary among airlines . the faa expects many carriers to show that their planes allow passengers to safely use their devices in airplane mode , gate-to-gate , by the end of 2013 . devices must be held or put in the seat-back pocket during the actual takeoff and landing . mobile phones must be in airplane mode or with mobile service disabled , with no signal bars displayed , and cannot be used for voice communications due to federal communications commission regulations that prohibit any airborne calls using mobile phones . if an air carrier provides wi-fi service during flight , passengers may use it . short-range bluetooth accessories , like wireless keyboards , can also be used .
france 's highest courts are located in paris . the court of cassation , the highest court in the judicial order , which reviews criminal and civil cases , is located in the palais de justice on the ile de la cite , while the conseil d 'etat , which provides legal advice to the executive and acts as the highest court in the administrative order , judging litigation against public bodies , is located in the palais-royal in the 1st arrondissement . the constitutional council , an advisory body with ultimate authority on the constitutionality of laws and government decrees , also meets in the montpensier wing of the palais royal .
some scholars believe that modern orthodoxy arose from the religious and social realities of western european jewry . while most jews consider modern orthodoxy traditional today , some ( the hareidi and hasidic groups ) within the orthodox community consider some elements to be of questionable validity . the neo-orthodox movement holds that hirsch 's views are not accurately followed by modern orthodoxy . [ see torah im derech eretz and torah umadda " relationship with torah im derech eretz " for a more extensive listing . ]
beginning in the late 1950s and 1960s , architectural phenomenology emerged as an important movement in the early reaction against modernism , with architects like charles moore in the usa , christian norberg-schulz in norway , and ernesto nathan rogers and vittorio gregotti in italy , who collectively popularized an interest in a new contemporary architecture aimed at expanding human experience using historical buildings as models and precedents . postmodernism produced a style that combined contemporary building technology and cheap materials , with the aesthetics of older pre-modern and non-modern styles , from high classical architecture to popular or vernacular regional building styles . robert venturi famously defined postmodern architecture as a " decorated shed " ( an ordinary building which is functionally designed inside and embellished on the outside ) , and upheld it against modernist and brutalist " ducks " ( buildings with unnecessarily expressive tectonic forms ) .
the contacts gained through university and american assembly fund-raising activities would later become important supporters in eisenhower 's bid for the republican party nomination and the presidency . meanwhile , columbia university 's liberal faculty members became disenchanted with the university president 's ties to oilmen and businessmen , including leonard mccollum , the president of continental oil ; frank abrams , the chairman of standard oil of new jersey ; bob kleberg , the president of the king ranch ; h. j. porter , a texas oil executive ; bob woodruff , the president of the coca-cola corporation ; and clarence francis , the chairman of general foods .
pubertal development also affects circulatory and respiratory systems as an adolescents ' heart and lungs increase in both size and capacity . these changes lead to increased strength and tolerance for exercise . sex differences are apparent as males tend to develop " larger hearts and lungs , higher systolic blood pressure , a lower resting heart rate , a greater capacity for carrying oxygen to the blood , a greater power for neutralizing the chemical products of muscular exercise , higher blood hemoglobin and more red blood cells . "
improvisation once played an important role in classical music . a remnant of this improvisatory tradition in classical music can be heard in the cadenza , a passage found mostly in concertos and solo works , designed to allow skilled performers to exhibit their virtuoso skills on the instrument . traditionally this was improvised by the performer ; however , it is often written for ( or occasionally by ) the performer beforehand . improvisation is also an important aspect in authentic performances of operas of baroque era and of bel canto ( especially operas of vincenzo bellini ) , and is best exemplified by the da capo aria , a form by which famous singers typically perform variations of the thematic matter of the aria in the recapitulation section ( ' b section ' / the ' da capo ' part ) . an example is beverly sills ' complex , albeit pre-written , variation of da tempeste il legno infranto from handel 's giulio cesare .
undergraduate tuition for the 2012 / 13 school year was $ 61,240 ; this includes the basic tuition of $ 43,380 , fees ( health $ 200 , etc . ) , room and board of $ 13,329 ( less if commuting ) , books and supplies $ 1,842 , personal expenses $ 1,890 , transportation cost of $ 400 . northwestern awards financial aid solely on the basis of need through loans , work-study , grants , and scholarships . the university processed in excess of $ 472 million in financial aid for the 2009-2010 academic year . this included $ 265 million in institutional funds , with the remainder coming from federal and state governments and private organizations and individuals . northwestern scholarship programs for undergraduate students support needy students from a variety of income and backgrounds . approximately 44 percent of the june 2010 graduates had received federal and / or private loans for their undergraduate education , graduating with an average debt of $ 17,200 .
the dutch written grammar has simplified over the past 100 years : cases are now mainly used for the pronouns , such as ik ( i ) , mij , me ( me ) , mijn ( my ) , wie ( who ) , wiens ( whose : masculine or neuter singular ) , wier ( whose : feminine singular ; masculine , feminine or neuter plural ) . nouns and adjectives are not case inflected ( except for the genitive of proper nouns ( names ) : -s , - ' s or - ' ) . in the spoken language cases and case inflections had already gradually disappeared from a much earlier date on ( probably the 15th century ) as in many continental west germanic dialects .
burke 's religious writing comprises published works and commentary on the subject of religion . burke 's religious thought was grounded in the belief that religion is the foundation of civil society . he sharply criticised deism and atheism , and emphasised christianity as a vehicle of social progress . born in ireland to a catholic mother and a protestant father , burke vigorously defended the anglican church , but also demonstrated sensitivity to catholic concerns . he linked the conservation of a state ( established ) religion with the preservation of citizens ' constitutional liberties and highlighted christianity 's benefit not only to the believer 's soul , but also to political arrangements .
according to reciprocity , the efficiency of an antenna used as a receiving antenna is identical to the efficiency as defined above . the power that an antenna will deliver to a receiver ( with a proper impedance match ) is reduced by the same amount . in some receiving applications , the very inefficient antennas may have little impact on performance . at low frequencies , for example , atmospheric or man-made noise can mask antenna inefficiency . for example , ccir rep. 258-3 indicates man-made noise in a residential setting at 40 mhz is about 28 db above the thermal noise floor . consequently , an antenna with a 20 db loss ( due to inefficiency ) would have little impact on system noise performance . the loss within the antenna will affect the intended signal and the noise / interference identically , leading to no reduction in signal to noise ratio ( snr ) .
following the 1974-75 loans affair , the malcolm fraser led liberal-country party coalition argued that the whitlam government was incompetent and delayed passage of the government 's money bills in the senate , until the government would promise a new election . whitlam refused , fraser insisted leading to the divisive 1975 australian constitutional crisis . the deadlock came to an end when the whitlam government was dismissed by the governor-general , sir john kerr on 11 november 1975 and fraser was installed as caretaker prime minister , pending an election . fraser won in a landslide at the resulting 1975 election .
more importantly , the contests were open to all , and the enforced anonymity of each submission guaranteed that neither gender nor social rank would determine the judging . indeed , although the " vast majority " of participants belonged to the wealthier strata of society ( " the liberal arts , the clergy , the judiciary , and the medical profession " ) , there were some cases of the popular classes submitting essays , and even winning . similarly , a significant number of women participated - and won - the competitions . of a total of 2300 prize competitions offered in france , women won 49 - perhaps a small number by modern standards , but very significant in an age in which most women did not have any academic training . indeed , the majority of the winning entries were for poetry competitions , a genre commonly stressed in women 's education .
cardigan formed up his unit and charged the length of the valley of the balaclava , under fire from russian batteries in the hills . the charge of the light brigade caused 278 casualties of the 700-man unit . the light brigade was memorialized in the famous poem by alfred lord tennyson , " the charge of the light brigade . " although traditionally the charge of the light brigade was looked upon as a glorious but wasted sacrifice of good men and horses , recent historians say that the charge of the light brigade did succeed in at least some of its objectives . the aim of any cavalry charge is to scatter the enemy lines and frighten the enemy off the battlefield . the charge of the light brigade had so unnerved the russian cavalry , which had previously been routed by the heavy brigade , that the russian cavalry was set to full-scale flight by the subsequent charge of the light brigade . : 252
the remaining band members recorded " independent women part i , " which appeared on the soundtrack to the 2000 film , charlie 's angels . it became their best-charting single , topping the u.s. billboard hot 100 chart for eleven consecutive weeks . in early 2001 , while destiny 's child was completing their third album , beyonce landed a major role in the mtv made-for-television film , carmen : a hip hopera , starring alongside american actor mekhi phifer . set in philadelphia , the film is a modern interpretation of the 19th century opera carmen by french composer georges bizet . when the third album survivor was released in may 2001 , luckett and roberson filed a lawsuit claiming that the songs were aimed at them . the album debuted at number one on the u.s. billboard 200 , with first-week sales of 663,000 copies sold . the album spawned other number-one hits , " bootylicious " and the title track , " survivor , " the latter of which earned the group a grammy award for best r & b performance by a duo or group with vocals . after releasing their holiday album 8 days of christmas in october 2001 , the group announced a hiatus to further pursue solo careers .
a project that is proceeding is the creation of the queen 's diamond jubilee galleries in the medieval triforium of the abbey . the aim is to create a new display area for the abbey 's treasures in the galleries high up around the abbey 's nave . to this end a new gothic access tower with lift has been designed by the abbey architect and surveyor of the fabric , ptolemy dean . it is planned that the new galleries will open in 2018 .
the west end of these streets is bowery and third avenue , except for 3rd street ( formerly amity place ; to sixth avenue ) and 4th street ( to 13th street ) , which extend west and north , respectively , into greenwich village . great jones street connects east 3rd to west 3rd .
with the gradual weakening of the marathas in the aftermath of the three anglo-maratha wars , the british also secured the ganges-jumna doab , the delhi-agra region , parts of bundelkhand , broach , some districts of gujarat , the fort of ahmmadnagar , province of cuttack ( which included mughalbandi / the coastal part of odisha , garjat / the princely states of odisha , balasore port , parts of midnapore district of west bengal ) , bombay ( mumbai ) and the surrounding areas , leading to a formal end of the maratha empire and firm establishment of the british east india company in india .
the legal process to change the definition of the kilogram is already underway , but it had been decided that no final decision would be made before the next meeting of the general conference on weights and measures in 2011 . ( for more detailed information , see kilogram definitions . ) the planck constant is a leading contender to form the basis of the new definition , although not the only one . possible new definitions include " the mass of a body at rest whose equivalent energy equals the energy of photons whose frequencies sum to 7050135639273999999 ♠ 135639274 × 1042 hz , " or simply " the kilogram is defined so that the planck constant equals 6966662606895999999 ♠ 6.62606896 × 10 − 34 j ⋅ s . "
a hdi of 0.8 or more is considered to represent " high development . " this includes all developed countries , such as those in north america , western europe , oceania , and eastern asia , as well as some developing countries in eastern europe , central and south america , southeast asia , the caribbean , and the oil-rich arabian peninsula . seven countries were promoted to this category this year , leaving the " medium development " group : albania , belarus , brazil , libya , macedonia , russia and saudi arabia .
atlas , rather than innovate , took a proven route of following popular trends in television and movies - westerns and war dramas prevailing for a time , drive-in movie monsters another time - and even other comic books , particularly the ec horror line . atlas also published a plethora of children 's and teen humor titles , including dan decarlo 's homer the happy ghost ( a la casper the friendly ghost ) and homer hooper ( a la archie andrews ) . atlas unsuccessfully attempted to revive superheroes from late 1953 to mid-1954 , with the human torch ( art by syd shores and dick ayers , variously ) , the sub-mariner ( drawn and most stories written by bill everett ) , and captain america ( writer stan lee , artist john romita sr. ) . atlas did not achieve any breakout hits and , according to stan lee , atlas survived chiefly because it produced work quickly , cheaply , and at a passable quality .
the palace measures 108 metres ( 354 ft ) by 120 metres ( 390 ft ) , is 24 metres ( 79 ft ) high and contains over 77,000 m2 ( 830,000 sq ft ) of floorspace . the floor area is smaller than the royal palace of madrid , the papal palace in rome , the louvre in paris , the hofburg palace in vienna , or the forbidden city . there are 775 rooms , including 19 state rooms , 52 principal bedrooms , 188 staff bedrooms , 92 offices , and 78 bathrooms . the principal rooms are contained on the piano nobile behind the west-facing garden facade at the rear of the palace . the centre of this ornate suite of state rooms is the music room , its large bow the dominant feature of the facade . flanking the music room are the blue and the white drawing rooms . at the centre of the suite , serving as a corridor to link the state rooms , is the picture gallery , which is top-lit and 55 yards ( 50 m ) long . the gallery is hung with numerous works including some by rembrandt , van dyck , rubens and vermeer ; other rooms leading from the picture gallery are the throne room and the green drawing room . the green drawing room serves as a huge anteroom to the throne room , and is part of the ceremonial route to the throne from the guard room at the top of the grand staircase . the guard room contains white marble statues of queen victoria and prince albert , in roman costume , set in a tribune lined with tapestries . these very formal rooms are used only for ceremonial and official entertaining , but are open to the public every summer .
alaska has vast energy resources , although its oil reserves have been largely depleted . major oil and gas reserves were found in the alaska north slope ( ans ) and cook inlet basins , but according to the energy information administration , by february 2014 alaska had fallen to fourth place in the nation in crude oil production after texas , north dakota , and california . prudhoe bay on alaska 's north slope is still the second highest-yielding oil field in the united states , typically producing about 400,000 barrels per day ( 64,000 m3 / d ) , although by early 2014 north dakota 's bakken formation was producing over 900,000 barrels per day ( 140,000 m3 / d ) . prudhoe bay was the largest conventional oil field ever discovered in north america , but was much smaller than canada 's enormous athabasca oil sands field , which by 2014 was producing about 1,500,000 barrels per day ( 240,000 m3 / d ) of unconventional oil , and had hundreds of years of producible reserves at that rate .
some hunter-gatherer cultures , such as the indigenous peoples of the pacific northwest coast , lived in particularly rich environments that allowed them to be sedentary or semi-sedentary .
the ieee 802.3af power over ethernet ( poe ) standard specifies a more elaborate power negotiation scheme than powered usb . it operates at 48 v dc and can supply more power ( up to 12.95 w , poe + 25.5 w ) over a cable up to 100 meters compared to usb 2.0 , which provides 2.5 w with a maximum cable length of 5 meters . this has made poe popular for voip telephones , security cameras , wireless access points and other networked devices within buildings . however , usb is cheaper than poe provided that the distance is short , and power demand is low .
during the nimrod expedition led by ernest shackleton in 1907 , parties led by edgeworth david became the first to climb mount erebus and to reach the south magnetic pole . douglas mawson , who assumed the leadership of the magnetic pole party on their perilous return , went on to lead several expeditions until retiring in 1931 . in addition , shackleton himself and three other members of his expedition made several firsts in december 1908 - february 1909 : they were the first humans to traverse the ross ice shelf , the first to traverse the transantarctic mountains ( via the beardmore glacier ) , and the first to set foot on the south polar plateau . an expedition led by norwegian polar explorer roald amundsen from the ship fram became the first to reach the geographic south pole on 14 december 1911 , using a route from the bay of whales and up the axel heiberg glacier . one month later , the doomed scott expedition reached the pole .
maharaja ranjit singh 's death in the summer of 1839 brought political chaos and the subsequent battles of succession and the bloody infighting between the factions at court weakened the state . relationships with neighbouring british territories then broke down , starting the first anglo-sikh war ; this led to a british official being resident in lahore and the annexation in 1849 of territory south of the satluj to british india . after the second anglo-sikh war in 1849 , the sikh empire became the last territory to be merged into british india . in jhelum 35 british soldiers of hm xxiv regiment were killed by the local resistance during the indian rebellion of 1857 .

the valencia cathedral was called iglesia mayor in the early days of the reconquista , then iglesia de la seo ( seo is from the latin sedes , i.e. , ( archiepiscopal ) see ) , and by virtue of the papal concession of 16 october 1866 , it was called the basilica metropolitana . it is situated in the centre of the ancient roman city where some believe the temple of diana stood . in gothic times , it seems to have been dedicated to the holy saviour ; the cid dedicated it to the blessed virgin ; king james i of aragon did likewise , leaving in the main chapel the image of the blessed virgin , which he carried with him and is reputed to be the one now preserved in the sacristy . the moorish mosque , which had been converted into a christian church by the conqueror , was deemed unworthy of the title of the cathedral of valencia , and in 1262 bishop andres de albalat laid the cornerstone of the new gothic building , with three naves ; these reach only to the choir of the present building . bishop vidal de blanes built the chapter hall , and james i added the tower , called el miguelete because it was blessed on st. michael 's day in 1418 . the tower is about 58 m high and topped with a belfry ( 1660-1736 ) .
these motors were originally invented to drive the capstan ( s ) of magnetic tape drives in the burgeoning computer industry , where minimal time to reach operating speed and minimal stopping distance were critical . pancake motors are still widely used in high-performance servo-controlled systems , robotic systems , industrial automation and medical devices . due to the variety of constructions now available , the technology is used in applications from high temperature military to low cost pump and basic servos .
political science is a late arrival in terms of social sciences [ citation needed ] . however , the discipline has a clear set of antecedents such as moral philosophy , political philosophy , political economy , history , and other fields concerned with normative determinations of what ought to be and with deducing the characteristics and functions of the ideal form of government . the roots of politics are in prehistory . in each historic period and in almost every geographic area , we can find someone studying politics and increasing political understanding .
bodhi ( pali and sanskrit , in devanagari : बॊधि ) is a term applied to the experience of awakening of arahants . bodhi literally means " awakening , " but it is more commonly translated into english as " enlightenment . " in early buddhism , bodhi carried a meaning synonymous to nirvana , using only some different metaphors to describe the experience , which implies the extinction of raga ( greed , craving ) , [ web 12 ] dosa ( hate , aversion ) [ web 13 ] and moha ( delusion ) . [ web 14 ] in the later school of mahayana buddhism , the status of nirvana was downgraded in some scriptures , coming to refer only to the extinction of greed and hate , implying that delusion was still present in one who attained nirvana , and that one needed to attain bodhi to eradicate delusion :
the language possesses five vowels ( or six , under the st. petersburg phonological school ) , which are written with different letters depending on whether or not the preceding consonant is palatalized . the consonants typically come in plain vs. palatalized pairs , which are traditionally called hard and soft . ( the hard consonants are often velarized , especially before front vowels , as in irish ) . the standard language , based on the moscow dialect , possesses heavy stress and moderate variation in pitch . stressed vowels are somewhat lengthened , while unstressed vowels tend to be reduced to near-close vowels or an unclear schwa . ( see also : vowel reduction in russian . )
after india gained independence in 1947 , a limited autonomy was conferred to new delhi and was administered by a chief commissioner appointed by the government of india . in 1956 , delhi was converted into a union territory and eventually the chief commissioner was replaced by a lieutenant governor . the constitution ( sixty-ninth amendment ) act , 1991 declared the union territory of delhi to be formally known as national capital territory of delhi . a system was introduced under which the elected government was given wide powers , excluding law and order which remained with the central government . the actual enforcement of the legislation came in 1993 .
the post of prime minister may be encountered both in constitutional monarchies ( such as belgium , denmark , japan , luxembourg , the netherlands , norway , malaysia , morocco , spain , sweden , thailand , canada , australia , new zealand , and the united kingdom ) , and in parliamentary republics in which the head of state is an elected official ( such as finland , the czech republic , france , greece , hungary , india , indonesia , ireland , pakistan , portugal , montenegro , croatia , bulgaria , romania , serbia and turkey ) . see also " first minister , " " premier , " " chief minister , " " chancellor , " " taoiseach , " " statsminister " and " secretary of state " : alternative titles usually equivalent in meaning to , or translated as , " prime minister . "
anti-government protests in 1991 led to a coup , a transitional government , and a new constitution . opposition to the corrupt and dictatorial regime of general moussa traore grew during the 1980s . during this time strict programs , imposed to satisfy demands of the international monetary fund , brought increased hardship upon the country 's population , while elites close to the government supposedly lived in growing wealth . peaceful student protests in january 1991 were brutally suppressed , with mass arrests and torture of leaders and participants . scattered acts of rioting and vandalism of public buildings followed , but most actions by the dissidents remained nonviolent .
the san diego symphony at symphony towers performs on a regular basis and is directed by jahja ling . the san diego opera at civic center plaza , directed by ian campbell , was ranked by opera america as one of the top 10 opera companies in the united states . old globe theatre at balboa park produces about 15 plays and musicals annually . the la jolla playhouse at ucsd is directed by christopher ashley . both the old globe theatre and the la jolla playhouse have produced the world premieres of plays and musicals that have gone on to win tony awards or nominations on broadway . the joan b. kroc theatre at kroc center 's performing arts center is a 600-seat state-of-the-art theatre that hosts music , dance , and theatre performances . the san diego repertory theatre at the lyceum theatres in horton plaza produces a variety of plays and musicals . hundreds of movies and a dozen tv shows have been filmed in san diego , a tradition going back as far as 1898 .
in an ecosystem , predation is a biological interaction where a predator ( an organism that is hunting ) feeds on its prey ( the organism that is attacked ) . predators may or may not kill their prey prior to feeding on them , but the act of predation often results in the death of the prey and the eventual absorption of the prey 's tissue through consumption . thus predation is often , though not always , carnivory . other categories of consumption are herbivory ( eating parts of plants ) , fungivory ( eating parts of fungi ) , and detritivory ( the consumption of dead organic material ( detritus ) ) . all these consumption categories fall under the rubric of consumer-resource systems . it can often be difficult to separate various types of feeding behaviors . for example , some parasitic species prey on a host organism and then lay their eggs on it for their offspring to feed on it while it continues to live in or on its decaying corpse after it has died . the key characteristic of predation however is the predator 's direct impact on the prey population . on the other hand , detritivores simply eat dead organic material arising from the decay of dead individuals and have no direct impact on the " donor " organism ( s ) .
next to sound shifts , there are ample examples of suffix differences . often simple suffix shifts ( like switching between -the , -ske , -ke , -je , ... ) , sometimes the suffixes even depend on quite specific grammar rules for a certain dialect . again taking west flemish as an example . in that language , the words " ja " ( yes ) and " nee " ( no ) are also conjugated to the ( often implicit ) subject of the sentence . these separate grammar rules are a lot more difficult to imitate correctly than simple sound shifts , making it easy to recognise people who didn 't grow up in a certain region , even decades after they moved .
elizabeth and philip were married on 20 november 1947 at westminster abbey . they received 2500 wedding gifts from around the world . because britain had not yet completely recovered from the devastation of the war , elizabeth required ration coupons to buy the material for her gown , which was designed by norman hartnell . in post-war britain , it was not acceptable for the duke of edinburgh 's german relations , including his three surviving sisters , to be invited to the wedding . the duke of windsor , formerly king edward viii , was not invited either .
original master discs are created by lathe-cutting : a lathe is used to cut a modulated groove into a blank record . the blank records for cutting used to be cooked up , as needed , by the cutting engineer , using what robert k. morrison describes as a " metallic soap , " containing lead litharge , ozokerite , barium sulfate , montan wax , stearin and paraffin , among other ingredients . cut " wax " sound discs would be placed in a vacuum chamber and gold-sputtered to make them electrically conductive for use as mandrels in an electroforming bath , where pressing stamper parts were made . later , the french company pyral invented a ready-made blank disc having a thin nitro-cellulose lacquer coating ( approximately 7 mils thickness on both sides ) that was applied to an aluminum substrate . lacquer cuts result in an immediately playable , or processable , master record . if vinyl pressings are wanted , the still-unplayed sound disc is used as a mandrel for electroforming nickel records that are used for manufacturing pressing stampers . the electroformed nickel records are mechanically separated from their respective mandrels . this is done with relative ease because no actual " plating " of the mandrel occurs in the type of electrodeposition known as electroforming , unlike with electroplating , in which the adhesion of the new phase of metal is chemical and relatively permanent . the one-molecule-thick coating of silver ( that was sprayed onto the processed lacquer sound disc in order to make its surface electrically conductive ) reverse-plates onto the nickel record 's face . this negative impression disc ( having ridges in place of grooves ) is known as a nickel master , " matrix " or " father . " the " father " is then used as a mandrel to electroform a positive disc known as a " mother . " many mothers can be grown on a single " father " before ridges deteriorate beyond effective use . the " mothers " are then used as mandrels for electroforming more negative discs known as " sons . " each " mother " can be used to make many " sons " before deteriorating . the " sons " are then converted into " stampers " by center-punching a spindle hole ( which was lost from the lacquer sound disc during initial electroforming of the " father " ) , and by custom-forming the target pressing profile . this allows them to be placed in the dies of the target ( make and model ) record press and , by center-roughing , to facilitate the adhesion of the label , which gets stuck onto the vinyl pressing without any glue . in this way , several million vinyl discs can be produced from a single lacquer sound disc . when only a few hundred discs are required , instead of electroforming a " son " ( for each side ) , the " father " is removed of its silver and converted into a stamper . production by this latter method , known as the " two-step-process " ( as it does not entail creation of " sons " but does involve creation of " mothers , " which are used for test playing and kept as " safeties " for electroforming future " sons " ) is limited to a few hundred vinyl pressings . the pressing count can increase if the stamper holds out and the quality of the vinyl is high . the " sons " made during a " three-step " electroforming make better stampers since they don 't require silver removal ( which reduces some high fidelity because of etching erasing part of the smallest groove modulations ) and also because they have a stronger metal structure than " fathers .

when ibn sina was 22 years old , he lost his father . the samanid dynasty came to its end in december 1004 . ibn sina seems to have declined the offers of mahmud of ghazni , and proceeded westwards to urgench in modern turkmenistan , where the vizier , regarded as a friend of scholars , gave him a small monthly stipend . the pay was small , however , so ibn sina wandered from place to place through the districts of nishapur and merv to the borders of khorasan , seeking an opening for his talents . qabus , the generous ruler of tabaristan , himself a poet and a scholar , with whom ibn sina had expected to find asylum , was on about that date ( 1012 ) starved to death by his troops who had revolted . ibn sina himself was at this time stricken by a severe illness . finally , at gorgan , near the caspian sea , ibn sina met with a friend , who bought a dwelling near his own house in which ibn sina lectured on logic and astronomy . several of ibn sina 's treatises were written for this patron ; and the commencement of his canon of medicine also dates from his stay in hyrcania .

by 1763 , the war in central europe was essentially a stalemate . frederick had retaken most of silesia and saxony but not the latter 's capital , dresden . his financial situation was not dire , but his kingdom was devastated and his army severely weakened . his manpower had dramatically decreased , and he had lost so many effective officers and generals that a new offensive was perhaps impossible . british subsidies had been stopped by the new prime minister lord bute , and the russian emperor had been overthrown by his wife , catherine , who ended russia 's alliance with prussia and withdrew from the war . austria , however , like most participants , was facing a severe financial crisis and had to decrease the size of its army , something which greatly affected its offensive power . indeed , after having effectively sustained a long war , its administration was in disarray . by that time , it still held dresden , the southeastern parts of saxony , the county of glatz , and southern silesia , but the prospect of victory was dim without russian support . in 1763 a peace settlement was reached at the treaty of hubertusburg , ending the war in central europe .
intercommunal violence erupted on december 21 , 1963 , when two turkish cypriots were killed at an incident involving the greek cypriot police . the violence resulted in the death of 364 turkish and 174 greek cypriots , destruction of 109 turkish cypriot or mixed villages and displacement of 25,000-30,000 turkish cypriots . the crisis resulted in the end of the turkish cypriot involvement in the administration and their claiming that it had lost its legitimacy ; the nature of this event is still controversial . in some areas , greek cypriots prevented turkish cypriots from travelling and entering government buildings , while some turkish cypriots willingly withdrew due to the calls of the turkish cypriot administration . turkish cypriots started living in enclaves ; the republic 's structure was changed unilaterally by makarios and nicosia was divided by the green line , with the deployment of unficyp troops .
sonam gyatso , after being granted the grandiose title by altan khan , departed for tibet . before he left , he sent a letter and gifts to the ming chinese official zhang juzheng ( 1525-1582 ) , which arrived on march 12 , 1579 . sometime in august or september of that year , sonam gyatso 's representative stationed with altan khan received a return letter and gift from the wanli emperor ( r . 1572-1620 ) , who also conferred upon sonam gyatso a title ; this was the first official contact between a dalai lama and a government of china . however , laird states that when wanli invited him to beijing , the dalai lama declined the offer due to a prior commitment , even though he was only 400 km ( 250 mi ) from beijing . laird adds that " the power of the ming emperor did not reach very far at the time . " although not recorded in any official chinese records , sonam gyatso 's biography states that wanli again conferred titles on sonam gyatso in 1588 , and invited him to beijing for a second time , but sonam gyatso was unable to visit china as he died the same year in mongolia working with altan khan 's son to further the spread of buddhism .
the gaza strip was occupied by egypt from 1948 to 1967 and then by israel after 1967 . in 2005 , as part of israel 's unilateral disengagement plan , israel removed all of its settlers and forces from the territory . israel does not consider the gaza strip to be occupied territory and declared it a " foreign territory . " that view has been disputed by numerous international humanitarian organizations and various bodies of the united nations . following june 2007 , when hamas assumed power in the gaza strip , israel tightened its control of the gaza crossings along its border , as well as by sea and air , and prevented persons from entering and exiting the area except for isolated cases it deemed humanitarian . gaza has a border with egypt and an agreement between israel , the european union and the pa governed how border crossing would take place ( it was monitored by european observers ) . egypt adhered to this agreement under mubarak and prevented access to gaza until april 2011 when it announced it was opening its border with gaza .

in why f a hayek is a conservative , british policy analyst madsen pirie claims hayek mistakes the nature of the conservative outlook . conservatives , he says , are not averse to change - but like hayek , they are highly averse to change being imposed on the social order by people in authority who think they know how to run things better . they wish to allow the market to function smoothly and give it the freedom to change and develop . it is an outlook , says pirie , that hayek and conservatives both share .
at the turn of the 21st century , a post-punk revival developed in british and american alternative and indie rock , which soon started appearing in other countries , as well . the earliest sign of a revival was the emergence of various underground bands in the mid- ' 90s . however , the first commercially successful bands - the strokes , franz ferdinand , interpol , neils children and editors - surfaced in the late 1990s to early 2000s , as did several dance-oriented bands such as the rapture , radio 4 and lcd soundsystem . additionally , some darker post-punk bands began to appear in the indie music scene in the 2010s , including cold cave , she wants revenge , eagulls , the soft moon , she past away and light asylum , who were also affiliated with the darkwave revival , as well as a place to bury strangers , who combined early post-punk and shoegaze . these bands tend to draw a fanbase who are a combination of the indie music subculture , older post-punk fans and the current goth subculture . in the 2010s , savages played a music reminiscent of early british post-punk bands of the late ' 70s .
travel and tourism continue to be extremely important for portugal , with visitor numbers forecast to increase significantly in the future . [ citation needed ] however , the increasing competition from eastern european destinations continues to develop , with the presence of similar attractions that are often cheaper in countries such as croatia . consequently , it has been necessary for the country to focus upon its niche attractions , such as health , nature and rural tourism , to stay ahead of its competitors .
in the constituent legislature or convention , the conservative and liberal elements formed using the nicknames of chirrines and cuchas . the military entered as a third party . the elections for the first regular legislature were disputed , and it was not until may 1 , 1826 , that the body was installed . the liberals gained control and the opposition responded by fomenting a conspiracy . this was promptly stopped with the aid of informers , and more strenuous measures were taken against the conservatives . extra powers were conferred on the durango governor , santiago baca ortiz , deputy to the first national congress , and leader of the liberal party .

the fitzroy tavern is a pub situated at 16 charlotte street in the fitzrovia district , to which it gives its name . it became famous ( or according to others , infamous ) during a period spanning the 1920s to the mid-1950s as a meeting place for many of london 's artists , intellectuals and bohemians such as dylan thomas , augustus john , and george orwell . several establishments in soho , london , have associations with well-known , post-war literary and artistic figures , including the pillars of hercules , the colony room and the coach and horses . the canonbury tavern , canonbury , was the prototype for orwell 's ideal english pub , the moon under water .
there are many different patterns of gas exchange demonstrated by different groups of insects . gas exchange patterns in insects can range from continuous and diffusive ventilation , to discontinuous gas exchange . : 65-68 during continuous gas exchange , oxygen is taken in and carbon dioxide is released in a continuous cycle . in discontinuous gas exchange , however , the insect takes in oxygen while it is active and small amounts of carbon dioxide are released when the insect is at rest . diffusive ventilation is simply a form of continuous gas exchange that occurs by diffusion rather than physically taking in the oxygen . some species of insect that are submerged also have adaptations to aid in respiration . as larvae , many insects have gills that can extract oxygen dissolved in water , while others need to rise to the water surface to replenish air supplies which may be held or trapped in special structures .
the first draft of the convention included political killings , but these provisions were removed in a political and diplomatic compromise following objections from some countries , including the ussr , a permanent security council member . the ussr argued that the convention 's definition should follow the etymology of the term , and may have feared greater international scrutiny of its own great purge . other nations feared that including political groups in the definition would invite international intervention in domestic politics . however leading genocide scholar william schabas states : " rigorous examination of the travaux fails to confirm a popular impression in the literature that the opposition to inclusion of political genocide was some soviet machination . the soviet views were also shared by a number of other states for whom it is difficult to establish any geographic or social common denominator : lebanon , sweden , brazil , peru , venezuela , the philippines , the dominican republic , iran , egypt , belgium , and uruguay . the exclusion of political groups was in fact originally promoted by a non-governmental organization , the world jewish congress , and it corresponded to raphael lemkin 's vision of the nature of the crime of genocide . "
beginning as a self-help program in the mid-1960s , the cotton research and promotion program ( crpp ) was organized by u.s. cotton producers in response to cotton 's steady decline in market share . at that time , producers voted to set up a per-bale assessment system to fund the program , with built-in safeguards to protect their investments . with the passage of the cotton research and promotion act of 1966 , the program joined forces and began battling synthetic competitors and re-establishing markets for cotton . today , the success of this program has made cotton the best-selling fiber in the u.s. and one of the best-selling fibers in the world .

the eight member countries of the warsaw pact pledged the mutual defense of any member who would be attacked . relations among the treaty signatories were based upon mutual non-intervention in the internal affairs of the member countries , respect for national sovereignty , and political independence . however , almost all governments of those member states were indirectly controlled by the soviet union .
in the western balkans , south slavs and germanic gepids intermarried with avar invaders , eventually producing a slavicized population . [ citation needed ] in central europe , the slavs intermixed with germanic and celtic , while the eastern slavs encountered uralic and scandinavian peoples . scandinavians ( varangians ) and finnic peoples were involved in the early formation of the rus ' state but were completely slavicized after a century . some finno-ugric tribes in the north were also absorbed into the expanding rus population . at the time of the magyar migration , the present-day hungary was inhabited by slavs , numbering about 200,000 , and by romano-dacians who were either assimilated or enslaved by the magyars . in the 11th and 12th centuries , constant incursions by nomadic turkic tribes , such as the kipchaks and the pechenegs , caused a massive migration of east slavic populations to the safer , heavily forested regions of the north . in the middle ages , groups of saxon ore miners settled in medieval bosnia , serbia and bulgaria where they were slavicized .
the directorate of operations is responsible for collecting foreign intelligence , mainly from clandestine humint sources , and covert action . the name reflects its role as the coordinator of human intelligence activities among other elements of the wider u.s. intelligence community with their own humint operations . this directorate was created in an attempt to end years of rivalry over influence , philosophy and budget between the united states department of defense ( dod ) and the cia . in spite of this , the department of defense recently organized its own global clandestine intelligence service , the defense clandestine service ( dcs ) , under the defense intelligence agency ( dia ) .
the meaning and origin of many archaic festivals baffled even rome 's intellectual elite , but the more obscure they were , the greater the opportunity for reinvention and reinterpretation - a fact lost neither on augustus in his program of religious reform , which often cloaked autocratic innovation , nor on his only rival as mythmaker of the era , ovid . in his fasti , a long-form poem covering roman holidays from january to june , ovid presents a unique look at roman antiquarian lore , popular customs , and religious practice that is by turns imaginative , entertaining , high-minded , and scurrilous ; not a priestly account , despite the speaker 's pose as a vates or inspired poet-prophet , but a work of description , imagination and poetic etymology that reflects the broad humor and burlesque spirit of such venerable festivals as the saturnalia , consualia , and feast of anna perenna on the ides of march , where ovid treats the assassination of the newly deified julius caesar as utterly incidental to the festivities among the roman people . but official calendars preserved from different times and places also show a flexibility in omitting or expanding events , indicating that there was no single static and authoritative calendar of required observances . in the later empire under christian rule , the new christian festivals were incorporated into the existing framework of the roman calendar , alongside at least some of the traditional festivals .
the great irish famine brought a large influx of irish immigrants . over 200,000 were living in new york by 1860 , upwards of a quarter of the city 's population . there was also extensive immigration from the german provinces , where revolutions had disrupted societies , and germans comprised another 25 % of new york 's population by 1860 .
on 23 october 1501 , at mielnik polish-lithuanian union was reformed at the union of mielnik ( polish : unia mielnicka , unia piotrkowsko-mielnicka ) . it was there that the tradition of the coronation sejm ( polish : " sejm koronacyjny " ) was founded . once again the middle nobility ( middle in wealth , not in rank ) attempted to reduce the power of the magnates with a law that made them impeachable before the senate for malfeasance . however the act of mielno ( polish : przywilej mielnicki ) of 25 october did more to strengthen the magnate dominated senate of poland then the lesser nobility . the nobles were given the right to disobey the king or his representatives - in the latin , " non praestanda oboedientia " - and to form confederations , an armed rebellion against the king or state officers if the nobles thought that the law or their legitimate privileges were being infringed .
the war of 1812 , the second and last american war against the united kingdom , was less successful for the u.s. than the revolution and northwest indian war against natives had been , though it ended on a high note for americans as well . after the taking control of lake erie in 1813 , the americans were able to seize parts of western upper canada , burn york and defeat tecumseh , which caused his indian confederacy to collapse . following ending victories in the province of upper canada , which dubbed the u.s. army " regulars , by god ! , " british troops were able to capture and burn washington . the regular army , however , proved they were professional and capable of defeating the british army during the invasions of plattsburgh and baltimore , prompting british agreement on the previously rejected terms of a status quo ante bellum . two weeks after a treaty was signed ( but not ratified ) , andrew jackson defeated the british in the battle of new orleans and became a national hero . per the treaty both sides returned to the status quo with no victor .
in ancient china , early literature was primarily focused on philosophy , historiography , military science , agriculture , and poetry . china , the origin of modern paper making and woodblock printing , produced one of the world 's first print cultures . much of chinese literature originates with the hundred schools of thought period that occurred during the eastern zhou dynasty ( 769-269 bce ) . the most important of these include the classics of confucianism , of daoism , of mohism , of legalism , as well as works of military science ( e.g. sun tzu 's the art of war ) and chinese history ( e.g. sima qian 's records of the grand historian ) . ancient chinese literature had a heavy emphasis on historiography , with often very detailed court records . an exemplary piece of narrative history of ancient china was the zuo zhuan , which was compiled no later than 389 bce , and attributed to the blind 5th century bce historian zuo qiuming .
throughout history there have been a series of lingua francas in the area to allow for better communication . the dialects spoken in hangzhou , shaoxing , and ningbo have taken on this role historically . since the founding of the people 's republic of china in 1949 , mandarin , which is not mutually intelligible with any of the local dialects , has been promoted as the standard language of communication throughout china . as a result , most of the population now can , to some degree , speak and comprehend mandarin and can code-switch when necessary . a majority of the population educated since 1978 can speak mandarin . urban residents tend to be more fluent in mandarin than rural people . nevertheless , a zhejiang accent is detectable in almost everyone from the area communicating in mandarin , and the home dialect remains an important part of the everyday lives and cultural identities of most zhejiang residents .
the united nations designates tuvalu as a least developed country ( ldc ) because of its limited potential for economic development , absence of exploitable resources and its small size and vulnerability to external economic and environmental shocks . tuvalu participates in the enhanced integrated framework for trade-related technical assistance to least developed countries ( eif ) , which was established in october 1997 under the auspices of the world trade organisation . in 2013 tuvalu deferred its graduation from least developed country ( ldc ) status to a developing country to 2015 . prime minister enele sopoaga said that this deferral was necessary to maintain access by tuvalu to the funds provided by the united nations 's national adaptation programme of action ( napa ) , as " once tuvalu graduates to a developed country , it will not be considered for funding assistance for climate change adaptation programmes like napa , which only goes to ldcs . " tuvalu had met targets so that tuvalu was to graduate from ldc status . prime minister , enele sopoaga wants the united nations to reconsider its criteria for graduation from ldc status as not enough weight is given to the environmental plight of small island states like tuvalu in the application of the environmental vulnerability index ( evi ) .
despite the failures in egypt , napoleon returned to a hero 's welcome . he drew together an alliance with director emmanuel joseph sieyes , his brother lucien , speaker of the council of five hundred roger ducos , director joseph fouche , and talleyrand , and they overthrew the directory by a coup d 'etat on 9 november 1799 ( " the 18th brumaire " according to the revolutionary calendar ) , closing down the council of five hundred . napoleon became " first consul " for ten years , with two consuls appointed by him who had consultative voices only . his power was confirmed by the new " constitution of the year viii , " originally devised by sieyes to give napoleon a minor role , but rewritten by napoleon , and accepted by direct popular vote ( 3,000,000 in favor , 1,567 opposed ) . the constitution preserved the appearance of a republic but in reality established a dictatorship .
the consolidation of the " hot ac " format contrasted with the near-demise of most other ac formats : beginning with the 2005-2007 economic downturn and eventual recession most stations went for the more chart-based chr , along with the top 40 , urban and even latino formats . diminishing physical record sales also proved a major blow to the ac genre .
tristan da cunha / ˈtrɪstən də ˈkuːnjə / , colloquially tristan , is both a remote group of volcanic islands in the south atlantic ocean and the main island of that group . it is the most remote inhabited archipelago in the world , lying 2,000 kilometres ( 1,200 mi ) from the nearest inhabited land , saint helena , 2,400 kilometres ( 1,500 mi ) from the nearest continental land , south africa , and 3,360 kilometres ( 2,090 mi ) from south america . the territory consists of the main island , also named tristan da cunha , which has a north-south length of 11.27 kilometres ( 7.00 mi ) and has an area of 98 square kilometres ( 38 sq mi ) , along with the smaller , uninhabited nightingale islands and the wildlife reserves of inaccessible and gough islands .
the arena football league ( afl ) is the highest level of professional indoor american football in the united states . it was founded in 1987 by jim foster , making it the third longest-running professional football league in north america , after the canadian football league and the national football league . it is played indoors on a 68-yard field ( about half the distance of an nfl field ) , resulting in a faster-paced and higher-scoring game . the sport was invented in the early 1980s and patented by foster , a former executive of the united states football league and the national football league .
while he was imprisoned in the castle of fardajan near hamadhan , avicenna wrote his famous " floating man " - literally falling man - thought experiment to demonstrate human self-awareness and the substantiality and immateriality of the soul . avicenna believed his " floating man " thought experiment demonstrated that the soul is a substance , and claimed humans cannot doubt their own consciousness , even in a situation that prevents all sensory data input . the thought experiment told its readers to imagine themselves created all at once while suspended in the air , isolated from all sensations , which includes no sensory contact with even their own bodies . he argued that , in this scenario , one would still have self-consciousness . because it is conceivable that a person , suspended in air while cut off from sense experience , would still be capable of determining his own existence , the thought experiment points to the conclusions that the soul is a perfection , independent of the body , and an immaterial substance . the conceivability of this " floating man " indicates that the soul is perceived intellectually , which entails the soul 's separateness from the body . avicenna referred to the living human intelligence , particularly the active intellect , which he believed to be the hypostasis by which god communicates truth to the human mind and imparts order and intelligibility to nature . following is an english translation of the argument :
in chapter ii , darwin specifies that the distinction between species and varieties is arbitrary , with experts disagreeing and changing their decisions when new forms were found . he concludes that " a well-marked variety may be justly called an incipient species " and that " species are only strongly marked and permanent varieties . " he argues for the ubiquity of variation in nature . historians have noted that naturalists had long been aware that the individuals of a species differed from one another , but had generally considered such variations to be limited and unimportant deviations from the archetype of each species , that archetype being a fixed ideal in the mind of god . darwin and wallace made variation among individuals of the same species central to understanding the natural world .
the czech people gained widespread national pride during the mid-eighteenth century , inspired by the age of enlightenment a half-century earlier . czech historians began to emphasize their people 's accomplishments from the fifteenth through the seventeenth centuries , rebelling against the counter-reformation ( which had denigrated czech and other non-latin languages ) . czech philologists studied sixteenth-century texts , advocating the return of the language to high culture . this period is known as the czech national revival ( or renascence ) .
the city has a rich history , spanning nearly 2000 years , as inferred from inscriptions found in the valley . religious and cultural festivities form a major part of the lives of people residing in kathmandu . most of kathmandu 's people follow hinduism and many others follow buddhism . there are people of other religious beliefs as well , giving kathmandu a cosmopolitan culture . nepali is the most commonly spoken language in the city . english is understood by kathmandu 's educated residents . historic areas of kathmandu were devastated by a 7.8 magnitude earthquake on 25 april 2015 .
while slaveholding was slightly less concentrated than in some southern states , according to the 1860 census , more than 330,000 people , or 33 % of the population of 992,622 , were enslaved african americans . they lived and worked chiefly on plantations in the eastern tidewater . in addition , 30,463 free people of color lived in the state . they were also concentrated in the eastern coastal plain , especially at port cities such as wilmington and new bern , where a variety of jobs were available . free african americans were allowed to vote until 1835 , when the state revoked their suffrage in restrictions following the slave rebellion of 1831 led by nat turner . southern slave codes criminalized willful killing of a slave in most cases .
the third great awakening refers to a hypothetical historical period that was marked by religious activism in american history and spans the late 1850s to the early 20th century . it affected pietistic protestant denominations and had a strong element of social activism . it gathered strength from the postmillennial belief that the second coming of christ would occur after mankind had reformed the entire earth . it was affiliated with the social gospel movement , which applied christianity to social issues and gained its force from the awakening , as did the worldwide missionary movement . new groupings emerged , such as the holiness , nazarene , and christian science movements .
within the past ten years , the amount of social networking sites available to the public has greatly increased as well as the number of adolescents using them . several sources report a high proportion of adolescents who use social media : 73 % of 12-17 year olds reported having at least one social networking profile ; two-thirds ( 68 % ) of teens text every day , half ( 51 % ) visit social networking sites daily , and 11 % send or receive tweets at least once every day . in fact , more than a third ( 34 % ) of teens visit their main social networking site several times a day . one in four ( 23 % ) teens are " heavy " social media users , meaning they use at least two different types of social media each and every day .
in august 2013 , the irish sun ended the practice of featuring topless models on page 3 . the main newspaper was reported to have followed in 2015 with the edition of 16 january supposedly the last to carry such photographs after a report in the times made such an assertion . after substantial coverage in the media about an alleged change in editorial policy , page 3 returned to its usual format on 22 january 2015 . a few hours before the issue was published , the head of pr at the newspaper said the reputed end of page 3 had been " speculation " only .

the first british mont blanc ascent was in 1788 ; the first female ascent in 1819 . by the mid-1850s swiss mountaineers had ascended most of the peaks and were eagerly sought as mountain guides . edward whymper reached the top of the matterhorn in 1865 ( after seven attempts ) , and in 1938 the last of the six great north faces of the alps was climbed with the first ascent of the eiger nordwand ( north face of the eiger ) .
on the following table , green arrows ( ) represent an increase in ranking over the previous study , while red arrows ( ) represent a decrease in ranking . they are followed by the number of spaces they moved . blue dashes ( ) represent a nation that did not move in the rankings since the previous study .
like his predecessor pius xii , paul vi put much emphasis on the dialogue with all nations of the world through establishing diplomatic relations . the number of foreign embassies accredited to the vatican doubled during his pontificate . this was a reflection of a new understanding between church and state , which had been formulated first by pius xi and pius xii but decreed by vatican ii . the pastoral constitution gaudium et spes stated that the catholic church is not bound to any form of government and willing to cooperate with all forms . the church maintained its right to select bishops on its own without any interference by the state .
with the example of the ming court 's relationship with the fifth karmapa and other tibetan leaders , norbu states that chinese communist historians have failed to realize the significance of the religious aspect of the ming-tibetan relationship . he writes that the meetings of lamas with the emperor of china were exchanges of tribute between " the patron and the priest " and were not merely instances of a political subordinate paying tribute to a superior . he also notes that the items of tribute were buddhist artifacts which symbolized " the religious nature of the relationship . " josef kolmas writes that the ming dynasty did not exercise any direct political control over tibet , content with their tribute relations that were " almost entirely of a religious character . " patricia ann berger writes that the yongle emperor 's courting and granting of titles to lamas was his attempt to " resurrect the relationship between china and tibet established earlier by the yuan dynastic founder khubilai khan and his guru phagpa . " she also writes that the later qing emperors and their mongol associates viewed the yongle emperor 's relationship with tibet as " part of a chain of reincarnation that saw this han chinese emperor as yet another emanation of manjusri . "
the slide rule was invented around 1620-1630 , shortly after the publication of the concept of the logarithm . it is a hand-operated analog computer for doing multiplication and division . as slide rule development progressed , added scales provided reciprocals , squares and square roots , cubes and cube roots , as well as transcendental functions such as logarithms and exponentials , circular and hyperbolic trigonometry and other functions . aviation is one of the few fields where slide rules are still in widespread use , particularly for solving time-distance problems in light aircraft . to save space and for ease of reading , these are typically circular devices rather than the classic linear slide rule shape . a popular example is the e6b .
electrolytic capacitors use an aluminum or tantalum plate with an oxide dielectric layer . the second electrode is a liquid electrolyte , connected to the circuit by another foil plate . electrolytic capacitors offer very high capacitance but suffer from poor tolerances , high instability , gradual loss of capacitance especially when subjected to heat , and high leakage current . poor quality capacitors may leak electrolyte , which is harmful to printed circuit boards . the conductivity of the electrolyte drops at low temperatures , which increases equivalent series resistance . while widely used for power-supply conditioning , poor high-frequency characteristics make them unsuitable for many applications . electrolytic capacitors will self-degrade if unused for a period ( around a year ) , and when full power is applied may short circuit , permanently damaging the capacitor and usually blowing a fuse or causing failure of rectifier diodes ( for instance , in older equipment , arcing in rectifier tubes ) . they can be restored before use ( and damage ) by gradually applying the operating voltage , often done on antique vacuum tube equipment over a period of 30 minutes by using a variable transformer to supply ac power . unfortunately , the use of this technique may be less satisfactory for some solid state equipment , which may be damaged by operation below its normal power range , requiring that the power supply first be isolated from the consuming circuits . such remedies may not be applicable to modern high-frequency power supplies as these produce full output voltage even with reduced input .
a sound generated on any instrument produces many modes of vibration that occur simultaneously . a listener hears numerous frequencies at once . the vibration with the lowest frequency is called the fundamental frequency ; the other frequencies are overtones . harmonics are an important class of overtones with frequencies that are integer multiples of the fundamental . whether or not the higher frequencies are integer multiples , they are collectively called the partials , referring to the different parts that make up the total spectrum .
the greatest mosaic work of the palaeologan renaissance in art is the decoration of the chora church in constantinople . although the mosaics of the naos have not survived except three panels , the decoration of the exonarthex and the esonarthex constitute the most important full-scale mosaic cycle in constantinople after the hagia sophia . they were executed around 1320 by the command of theodore metochites . the esonarthex has two fluted domes , specially created to provide the ideal setting for the mosaic images of the ancestors of christ . the southern one is called the dome of the pantokrator while the northern one is the dome of the theotokos . the most important panel of the esonarthex depicts theodore metochites wearing a huge turban , offering the model of the church to christ . the walls of both narthexes are decorated with mosaic cycles from the life of the virgin and the life of christ . these panels show the influence of the italian trecento on byzantine art especially the more natural settings , landscapes , figures .
both intensive and free-range farming have animal welfare concerns . in intensive systems , cannibalism , feather pecking and vent pecking can be common , with some farmers using beak trimming as a preventative measure . diseases can also be common and spread rapidly through the flock . in extensive systems , the birds are exposed to adverse weather conditions and are vulnerable to predators and disease-carrying wild birds . barn systems have been found to have the worst bird welfare . in southeast asia , a lack of disease control in free-range farming has been associated with outbreaks of avian influenza .
in the following year , bell became professor of vocal physiology and elocution at the boston university school of oratory . during this period , he alternated between boston and brantford , spending summers in his canadian home . at boston university , bell was " swept up " by the excitement engendered by the many scientists and inventors residing in the city . he continued his research in sound and endeavored to find a way to transmit musical notes and articulate speech , but although absorbed by his experiments , he found it difficult to devote enough time to experimentation . while days and evenings were occupied by his teaching and private classes , bell began to stay awake late into the night , running experiment after experiment in rented facilities at his boarding house . keeping " night owl " hours , he worried that his work would be discovered and took great pains to lock up his notebooks and laboratory equipment . bell had a specially made table where he could place his notes and equipment inside a locking cover . worse still , his health deteriorated as he suffered severe headaches . returning to boston in fall 1873 , bell made a fateful decision to concentrate on his experiments in sound .
amid preparations for the coronation , princess margaret informed her sister that she wished to marry peter townsend , a divorce " 16 years margaret 's senior , with two sons from his previous marriage . the queen asked them to wait for a year ; in the words of martin charteris , " the queen was naturally sympathetic towards the princess , but i think she thought - she hoped - given time , the affair would peter out . " senior politicians were against the match and the church of england did not permit remarriage after divorce . if margaret had contracted a civil marriage , she would have been expected to renounce her right of succession . eventually , she decided to abandon her plans with townsend . in 1960 , she married antony armstrong-jones , who was created earl of snowdon the following year . they divorced in 1978 ; she did not remarry .
the pv industry has seen drops in module prices since 2008 . in late 2011 , factory-gate prices for crystalline-silicon photovoltaic modules dropped below the $ 1.00 / w mark . the $ 1.00 / w installed cost , is often regarded in the pv industry as marking the achievement of grid parity for pv . these reductions have taken many stakeholders , including industry analysts , by surprise , and perceptions of current solar power economics often lags behind reality . some stakeholders still have the perspective that solar pv remains too costly on an unsubsidized basis to compete with conventional generation options . yet technological advancements , manufacturing process improvements , and industry re-structuring , mean that further price reductions are likely in coming years .
the first non-stop transatlantic crossing was made by the british airship r34 in 1919 . regular passenger service resumed in the 1920s and the discovery of helium reserves in the united states promised increased safety , but the u.s. government refused to sell the gas for this purpose . therefore , h2 was used in the hindenburg airship , which was destroyed in a midair fire over new jersey on 6 may 1937 . the incident was broadcast live on radio and filmed . ignition of leaking hydrogen is widely assumed to be the cause , but later investigations pointed to the ignition of the aluminized fabric coating by static electricity . but the damage to hydrogen 's reputation as a lifting gas was already done .
reflection of the original signal also occurs when it hits an extended conductive surface , in a fashion similar to a mirror . this effect can also be used to increase signal through the use of a reflector , normally placed behind the active element and spaced so the reflected signal reaches the element in-phase . generally the reflector will remain highly reflective even if it is not solid ; gaps less than 1 ⁄ 10 generally have little effect on the outcome . for this reason , reflectors often take the form of wire meshes or rows of passive elements , which makes them lighter and less subject to wind . the parabolic reflector is perhaps the best known example of a reflector-based antenna , which has an effective area far greater than the active element alone .
during world war ii , kansas was one of 131 colleges and universities nationally that took part in the v-12 navy college training program which offered students a path to a navy commission .
like the pagan empire , ava , hanthawaddy and the shan states were all multi-ethnic polities . despite the wars , cultural synchronisation continued . this period is considered a golden age for burmese culture . burmese literature " grew more confident , popular , and stylistically diverse , " and the second generation of burmese law codes as well as the earliest pan-burma chronicles emerged . hanthawaddy monarchs introduced religious reforms that later spread to the rest of the country . many splendid temples of mrauk u were built during this period .
washington university 's north campus and west campus principally house administrative functions that are not student focused . north campus lies in st. louis city near the delmar loop . the university acquired the building and adjacent property in 2004 , formerly home to the angelica uniform factory . several university administrative departments are located at the north campus location , including offices for quadrangle housing , accounting and treasury services , parking and transportation services , army rotc , and network technology services . the north campus location also provides off-site storage space for the performing arts department . renovations are still ongoing ; recent additions to the north campus space include a small eatery operated by bon appetit management company , the university 's on-campus food provider , completed during spring semester 2007 , as well as the family learning center , operated by bright horizons and opened in september 2010 .
as of 2000 [ update ] , children and teenagers ( 0-19 years old ) make up 15.1 % of the population , while adults ( 20-64 years old ) make up 65 % and seniors ( over 64 years old ) make up 19.9 % .
the late turrell v. wylie , a former professor of the university of washington , and li tieh-tseng argue that the reliability of the heavily censored history of ming as a credible source on sino-tibetan relations is questionable , in the light of modern scholarship . other historians also assert that these ming titles were nominal and did not actually confer the authority that the earlier yuan titles had . van praag writes that the " numerous economically motivated tibetan missions to the ming court are referred to as ' tributary missions ' in the ming shih . " van praag writes that these " tributary missions " were simply prompted by china 's need for horses from tibet , since a viable horse market in mongol lands was closed as a result of incessant conflict . morris rossabi also writes that " tibet , which had extensive contacts with china during the yuan , scarcely had diplomatic relations with the ming . "
the clerk of the parliaments , an official of the house of lords , traditionally states a formula in anglo-norman law french , indicating the sovereign 's decision . the granting of royal assent to a supply bill is indicated with the words " la reyne remercie ses bons sujets , accepte leur benevolence , et ainsi le veult , " translated as " the queen thanks her good subjects , accepts their bounty , and wills it so . " for other public or private bills , the formula is simply " la reyne le veult " ( " the queen wills it " ) . for personal bills , the phrase is " soit fait comme il est desire " ( " let it be as it is desired " ) . the appropriate formula for withholding assent is the euphemistic " la reyne s 'avisera " ( " the queen will consider it " ) . when the sovereign is male , le roy is substituted for la reyne .
interracial relationships have had a long history in north america and the united states , beginning with the intermixing of european explorers and soldiers , who took native women as companions . after european settlement increased , traders and fur trappers often married or had unions with women of native tribes . in the 17th century , faced with a continuing , critical labor shortage , colonists primarily in the chesapeake bay colony , imported africans as laborers , sometimes as indentured servants and , increasingly , as slaves . african slaves were also imported into new york and other northern ports by the dutch and later english . some african slaves were freed by their masters during these early years .
northwestern was elected to the association of american universities in 1917 and remains a research university with " very high " research activity . northwestern 's schools of management , engineering , and communication are among the most academically productive in the nation . northwestern received $ 550 million in research funding in 2014 . northwestern supports nearly 1,500 research laboratories across two campuses , predominately in the medical and biological sciences . through the innovation and new ventures office ( invo ) , northwestern researchers disclosed 247 inventions , filed 270 patents applications , received 81 foreign and us patents , started 12 companies , and generated $ 79.8 million in licensing revenue in 2013 . the bulk of revenue has come from a patent on pregabalin , a synthesized organic molecule discovered by chemistry professor richard silverman , which ultimately was marketed as lyrica , a drug sold by pfizer , to combat epilepsy , neuropathic pain , and fibromyalgia . invo has been involved in creating a number of centers , including the center for developmental therapeutics ( cdt ) and the center for device development ( cd2 ) . it has also helped form over 50 northwestern startup companies based on northwestern technologies .
starting in the 1980s , he travelled with his all-female amazonian guard , who were allegedly sworn to a life of celibacy . however , according to psychologist seham sergewa , after the civil war several of the guards told her they had been pressured into joining and raped by gaddafi and senior officials . he hired several ukrainian nurses to care for him and his family 's health , and traveled everywhere with his trusted ukrainian nurse halyna kolotnytska . kolotnytska 's daughter denied the suggestion that the relationship was anything but professional .
the preserved records of the reichssicherheitshauptamt ( the reich security main office ) show the persecution of freemasons during the holocaust . rsha amt vii ( written records ) was overseen by professor franz six and was responsible for " ideological " tasks , by which was meant the creation of antisemitic and anti-masonic propaganda . while the number is not accurately known , it is estimated that between 80,000 and 200,000 freemasons were killed under the nazi regime . masonic concentration camp inmates were graded as political prisoners and wore an inverted red triangle .
the usefulness of the canals was short-lived , though some have now been restored for recreation . the 19th century also saw the construction of railways to and through somerset . the county was served by five pre-1923 grouping railway companies : the great western railway ( gwr ) ; a branch of the midland railway ( mr ) to bath green park ( and another one to bristol ) ; the somerset and dorset joint railway , and the london and south western railway ( l & swr ) . the former main lines of the gwr are still in use today , although many of its branch lines were scrapped under the notorious beeching axe . the former lines of the somerset and dorset joint railway closed completely , as has the branch of the midland railway to bath green park ( and to bristol st philips ) ; however , the l & swr survived as a part of the present west of england main line . none of these lines , in somerset , are electrified . two branch lines , the west and east somerset railways , were rescued and transferred back to private ownership as " heritage " lines . the fifth railway was a short-lived light railway , the weston , clevedon and portishead light railway . the west somerset mineral railway carried the iron ore from the brendon hills to watchet .
craig venter and francis collins of the national institute of health jointly made the announcement of the mapping of the human genome in 2000 . upon examining the data from the genome mapping , venter realized that although the genetic variation within the human species is on the order of 1-3 % ( instead of the previously assumed 1 % ) , the types of variations do not support notion of genetically defined races . venter said , " race is a social concept . it 's not a scientific one . there are no bright lines ( that would stand out ) , if we could compare all the sequenced genomes of everyone on the planet . " " when we try to apply science to try to sort out these social differences , it all falls apart . "
in may 2014 , oklahoma director of corrections , robert patton , recommended an indefinite hold on executions in the state after the botched execution of african-american clayton lockett . the prisoner had to be tasered to restrain him prior to the execution , and the lethal injection missed a vein in his groin , resulting in lockett regaining consciousness , trying to get up , and to speak , before dying of a heart attack 43 minutes later , after the attempted execution had been called off . in 2015 , the state approved nitrogen asphyxiation as a method of execution .
the " formal " interpretation is more widespread than the " substantive " interpretation . formalists hold that the law must be prospective , well-known , and have characteristics of generality , equality , and certainty . other than that , the formal view contains no requirements as to the content of the law . this formal approach allows laws that protect democracy and individual rights , but recognizes the existence of " rule of law " in countries that do not necessarily have such laws protecting democracy or individual rights .
one study showed that czech and slovak lexicons differed by 80 percent , but this high percentage was found to stem primarily from differing orthographies and slight inconsistencies in morphological formation ; slovak morphology is more regular ( when changing from the nominative to the locative case , praha becomes praze in czech and prahe in slovak ) . the two lexicons are generally considered similar , with most differences in colloquial vocabulary and some scientific terminology . slovak has slightly more borrowed words than czech .
ipods have been criticized for alleged short life-span and fragile hard drives . a 2005 survey conducted on the macintouch website found that the ipod line had an average failure rate of 13.7 % ( although they note that comments from respondents indicate that " the true ipod failure rate may be lower than it appears " ) . it concluded that some models were more durable than others . in particular , failure rates for ipods employing hard drives was usually above 20 % while those with flash memory had a failure rate below 10 % . in late 2005 , many users complained that the surface of the first generation ipod nano can become scratched easily , rendering the screen unusable . a class action lawsuit was also filed . apple initially considered the issue a minor defect , but later began shipping these ipods with protective sleeves .

two days after the marriage , bonaparte left paris to take command of the army of italy . he immediately went on the offensive , hoping to defeat the forces of piedmont before their austrian allies could intervene . in a series of rapid victories during the montenotte campaign , he knocked piedmont out of the war in two weeks . the french then focused on the austrians for the remainder of the war , the highlight of which became the protracted struggle for mantua . the austrians launched a series of offensives against the french to break the siege , but napoleon defeated every relief effort , scoring notable victories at the battles of castiglione , bassano , arcole , and rivoli . the decisive french triumph at rivoli in january 1797 led to the collapse of the austrian position in italy . at rivoli , the austrians lost up to 14,000 men while the french lost about 5,000 .
because of oklahoma 's position between zones of differing prevailing temperature and winds , weather patterns within the state can vary widely over relatively short distances and can change drastically in a short time . as an example , on november 11 , 1911 , the temperature at oklahoma city reached 83 ° f ( 28 ° c ) in the afternoon ( the record high for that date ) , then an arctic cold front of unprecedented intensity slammed across the state , causing the temperature to crash 66 degrees , down to 17 ° f ( − 8 ° c ) at midnight ( the record low for that date ) ; thus , both the record high and record low for november 11 were set on the same date . this type of phenomenon is also responsible for many of the tornadoes in the area , such as the 1912 oklahoma tornado outbreak , when a warm front traveled along a stalled cold front , resulting in an average of about one tornado per hour over the course of a day .
a large number of international institutions have their seats in switzerland , in part because of its policy of neutrality . geneva is the birthplace of the red cross and red crescent movement and the geneva conventions and , since 2006 , hosts the united nations human rights council . even though switzerland is one of the most recent countries to have joined the united nations , the palace of nations in geneva is the second biggest centre for the united nations after new york , and switzerland was a founding member and home to the league of nations .
the primary responsibility for a boy 's studies lies with his house master , but he is assisted by an additional director of studies , known as a tutor . classes , colloquially known as " divs " ( divisions ) , are organised on a school basis ; the classrooms are separate from the houses . new school buildings have appeared for teaching purposes every decade or so since new schools , designed by henry woodyer and built 1861-3 . despite the introduction of modern technology , the external appearance and locations of many of the classrooms have remained unchanged for a long time .
in january 2011 , just weeks after leaving office in california , schwarzenegger announced that he was reading several new scripts for future films , one of them being the world war ii action drama with wings as eagles , written by randall wallace , based on a true story . on march 6 , 2011 , at the arnold seminar of the arnold classic , schwarzenegger revealed that he was being considered for several films , including sequels to the terminator and remakes of predator and the running man , and that he was " packaging " a comic book character . the character was later revealed to be the governator , star of the comic book and animated series of the same name . schwarzenegger inspired the character and co-developed it with stan lee , who would have produced the series . schwarzenegger would have voiced the governator .
hydrogen is not an energy resource , except in the hypothetical context of commercial nuclear fusion power plants using deuterium or tritium , a technology presently far from development . the sun 's energy comes from nuclear fusion of hydrogen , but this process is difficult to achieve controllably on earth . elemental hydrogen from solar , biological , or electrical sources require more energy to make it than is obtained by burning it , so in these cases hydrogen functions as an energy carrier , like a battery . hydrogen may be obtained from fossil sources ( such as methane ) , but these sources are unsustainable .
on march 31 , 2010 , the youtube website launched a new design , with the aim of simplifying the interface and increasing the time users spend on the site . google product manager shiva rajaraman commented : " we really felt like we needed to step back and remove the clutter . " in may 2010 , it was reported that youtube was serving more than two billion videos a day , which it described as " nearly double the prime-time audience of all three major us television networks combined . " in may 2011 , youtube reported in its company blog that the site was receiving more than three billion views per day . in january 2012 , youtube stated that the figure had increased to four billion videos streamed per day .
over the course of 2013 , the corporation began the sale of its us shale gas assets and cancelled a us $ 20 billion gas project that was to be constructed in the us state of louisiana . a new ceo ben van beurden was appointed in january 2014 , prior to the announcement that the corporation 's overall performance in 2013 was 38 per cent lower than 2012 - the value of shell 's shares fell by 3 per cent as a result . following the sale of the majority of its australian assets in february 2014 , the corporation plans to sell a further us $ 15 billion worth of assets in the period leading up to 2015 , with deals announced in australia , brazil and italy .
ecclesiam suam was given at st. peter 's , rome , on the feast of the transfiguration , 6 august 1964 , the second year of his pontificate . it is considered an important document , identifying the catholic church with the body of christ . a later council document lumen gentium stated that the church subsists in the body of christ , raising questions as to the difference between " is " and " subsists in . " paul vi appealed to " all people of good will " and discussed necessary dialogues within the church and between the churches and with atheism .
in iberia , the christian states , which had been confined to the north-western part of the peninsula , began to push back against the islamic states in the south , a period known as the reconquista . by about 1150 , the christian north had coalesced into the five major kingdoms of leon , castile , aragon , navarre , and portugal . southern iberia remained under control of islamic states , initially under the caliphate of cordoba , which broke up in 1031 into a shifting number of petty states known as taifas , who fought with the christians until the almohad caliphate re-established centralised rule over southern iberia in the 1170s . christian forces advanced again in the early 13th century , culminating in the capture of seville in 1248 .
dumbwaiters are small freight elevators that are intended to carry food , books or other small freight loads rather than passengers . they often connect kitchens to rooms on other floors. they usually do not have the same safety features found in passenger elevators , like various ropes for redundancy. they have a lower capacity , and they can be up to 1 meter ( 3 ft . ) tall. there 's a control panel at every stop , that mimics the ones found in passenger elevators , like calling , door control , floor selection .
four boarders at his parents ' apartments became chopin 's intimates : tytus woyciechowski , jan nepomucen białobłocki , jan matuszynski and julian fontana ; the latter two would become part of his paris milieu . he was friendly with members of warsaw 's young artistic and intellectual world , including fontana , jozef bohdan zaleski and stefan witwicki . he was also attracted to the singing student konstancja gładkowska . in letters to woyciechowski , he indicated which of his works , and even which of their passages , were influenced by his fascination with her ; his letter of 15 may 1830 revealed that the slow movement ( larghetto ) of his piano concerto no. 1 ( in e minor ) was secretly dedicated to her - " it should be like dreaming in beautiful springtime - by moonlight . " his final conservatory report ( july 1829 ) read : " chopin f. , third-year student , exceptional talent , musical genius . "
southampton is also home to one of the most successful college american football teams in the uk , the southampton stags , who play at the wide lane sports facility in eastleigh .
in 1756 and 1757 the french captured forts oswego and william henry from the british . the latter victory was marred when france 's native allies broke the terms of capitulation and attacked the retreating british column , which was under french guard , slaughtering and scalping soldiers and taking captive many men , women and children while the french refused to protect their captives . french naval deployments in 1757 also successfully defended the key fortress of louisbourg on cape breton island , securing the seaward approaches to quebec .
the salivary glands ( element 30 in numbered diagram ) in an insect 's mouth produce saliva . the salivary ducts lead from the glands to the reservoirs and then forward through the head to an opening called the salivarium , located behind the hypopharynx . by moving its mouthparts ( element 32 in numbered diagram ) the insect can mix its food with saliva . the mixture of saliva and food then travels through the salivary tubes into the mouth , where it begins to break down . some insects , like flies , have extra-oral digestion . insects using extra-oral digestion expel digestive enzymes onto their food to break it down . this strategy allows insects to extract a significant proportion of the available nutrients from the food source . : 31 the gut is where almost all of insects ' digestion takes place . it can be divided into the foregut , midgut and hindgut .
in 1977 , gaddafi dissolved the republic and created a new socialist state , the jamahiriya ( " state of the masses " ) . officially adopting a symbolic role in governance , he retained power as military commander-in-chief and head of the revolutionary committees responsible for policing and suppressing opponents . overseeing unsuccessful border conflicts with egypt and chad , gaddafi 's support for foreign militants and alleged responsibility for the lockerbie bombing led to libya 's label of " international pariah . " a particularly hostile relationship developed with the united states and united kingdom , resulting in the 1986 u.s. bombing of libya and united nations-imposed economic sanctions . rejecting his earlier ideological commitments , from 1999 gaddafi encouraged economic privatization and sought rapprochement with western nations , also embracing pan-africanism and helping to establish the african union . amid the arab spring , in 2011 an anti-gaddafist uprising led by the national transitional council ( ntc ) broke out , resulting in the libyan civil war . nato intervened militarily on the side of the ntc , bringing about the government 's downfall . retreating to sirte , gaddafi was captured and killed by ntc militants .
the city lies on approximately 200 deep canyons and hills separating its mesas , creating small pockets of natural open space scattered throughout the city and giving it a hilly geography . traditionally , san diegans have built their homes and businesses on the mesas , while leaving the urban canyons relatively wild . thus , the canyons give parts of the city a segmented feel , creating gaps between otherwise proximate neighborhoods and contributing to a low-density , car-centered environment . the san diego river runs through the middle of san diego from east to west , creating a river valley which serves to divide the city into northern and southern segments . the river used to flow into san diego bay and its fresh water was the focus of the earliest spanish explorers . [ citation needed ] several reservoirs and mission trails regional park also lie between and separate developed areas of the city .
the term heresy is from greek αιρεσις originally meant " choice " or " thing chosen , " but it came to mean the " party or school of a man 's choice " and also referred to that process whereby a young person would examine various philosophies to determine how to live . the word " heresy " is usually used within a christian , jewish , or islamic context , and implies slightly different meanings in each . the founder or leader of a heretical movement is called a heresiarch , while individuals who espouse heresy or commit heresy are known as heretics . heresiology is the study of heresy .
the story focuses on series protagonist link , who tries to prevent hyrule from being engulfed by a corrupted parallel dimension known as the twilight realm . to do so , he takes the form of both a hylian and a wolf , and is assisted by a mysterious creature named midna . the game takes place hundreds of years after ocarina of time and majora 's mask , in an alternate timeline from the wind waker .
the deliberate separation of the luftwaffe from the rest of the military structure encouraged the emergence of a major " communications gap " between hitler and the luftwaffe , which other factors helped to exacerbate . for one thing , goring 's fear of hitler led him to falsify or misrepresent what information was available in the direction of an uncritical and over-optimistic interpretation of air strength . when goring decided against continuing wever 's original heavy bomber programme in 1937 , the reichsmarschall 's own explanation was that hitler wanted to know only how many bombers there were , not how many engines each had . in july 1939 , goring arranged a display of the luftwaffe 's most advanced equipment at rechlin , to give the impression the air force was more prepared for a strategic air war than was actually the case .
the coastline of norfolk island consists , to varying degrees , of cliff faces . a downward slope exists towards slaughter bay and emily bay , the site of the original colonial settlement of kingston . there are no safe harbour facilities on norfolk island , with loading jetties existing at kingston and cascade bay . all goods not domestically produced are brought in by ship , usually to cascade bay . emily bay , protected from the pacific ocean by a small coral reef , is the only safe area for recreational swimming , although surfing waves can be found at anson and ball bays .
soviet premier nikita khrushchev announced that a " spy-plane " had been shot down but intentionally made no reference to the pilot . as a result , the eisenhower administration , thinking the pilot had died in the crash , authorized the release of a cover story claiming that the plane was a " weather research aircraft " which had unintentionally strayed into soviet airspace after the pilot had radioed " difficulties with his oxygen equipment " while flying over turkey . the soviets put captain powers on trial and displayed parts of the u-2 , which had been recovered almost fully intact .
it is not clear exactly where collegiate a cappella began . the rensselyrics of rensselaer polytechnic institute ( formerly known as the rpi glee club ) , established in 1873 is perhaps the oldest known collegiate a cappella group . [ citation needed ] however the longest continuously-singing group is probably the whiffenpoofs of yale university , which was formed in 1909 and once included cole porter as a member . collegiate a cappella groups grew throughout the 20th century . some notable historical groups formed along the way include princeton university 's tigertones ( 1946 ) , colgate university 's the colgate 13 ( 1942 ) , dartmouth college 's aires ( 1946 ) , cornell university 's cayuga 's waiters ( 1949 ) and the hangovers ( 1968 ) , the university of maine maine steiners ( 1958 ) , the columbia university kingsmen ( 1949 ) , the jabberwocks of brown university ( 1949 ) , and the university of rochester yellowjackets ( 1956 ) . all-women a cappella groups followed shortly , frequently as a parody of the men 's groups : the smiffenpoofs of smith college ( 1936 ) , the shwiffs of connecticut college ( the she-whiffenpoofs , 1944 ) , and the chattertocks of brown university ( 1951 ) . a cappella groups exploded in popularity beginning in the 1990s , fueled in part by a change in style popularized by the tufts university beelzebubs and the boston university dear abbeys . the new style used voices to emulate modern rock instruments , including vocal percussion / " beatboxing . " some larger universities now have multiple groups . groups often join one another in on-campus concerts , such as the georgetown chimes ' cherry tree massacre , a 3-weekend a cappella festival held each february since 1975 , where over a hundred collegiate groups have appeared , as well as international quartet champions the boston common and the contemporary commercial a cappella group rockapella . co-ed groups have produced many up-and-coming and major artists , including john legend , an alumnus of the counterparts at the university of pennsylvania , and sara bareilles , an alumna of awaken a cappella at university of california , los angeles . mira sorvino is an alumna of the harvard-radcliffe veritones of harvard college where she had the solo on only you by yaz .

transport in the republic of the congo includes land , air and water transportation . the country 's rail system was built by forced laborers during the 1930s and largely remains in operation . there are also over 1000 km of paved roads and two major international airports ( maya-maya airport and pointe noire airport ) which have flights to paris and many african cities . the country also has a large port on the atlantic ocean at pointe-noire and others along the congo river at brazzaville and impfondo .
the times commissioned the serif typeface times new roman , created by victor lardent at the english branch of monotype , in 1931 . it was commissioned after stanley morison had written an article criticizing the times for being badly printed and typographically antiquated . the font was supervised by morison and drawn by victor lardent , an artist from the advertising department of the times . morison used an older font named plantin as the basis for his design , but made revisions for legibility and economy of space . times new roman made its debut in the issue of 3 october 1932 . after one year , the design was released for commercial sale . the times stayed with times new roman for 40 years , but new production techniques and the format change from broadsheet to tabloid in 2004 have caused the newspaper to switch font five times since 1972 . however , all the new fonts have been variants of the original new roman font :
anthropologists believe the most significant benefit would have been the use of dogs ' robust sense of smell to assist with the hunt . the relationship between the presence of a dog and success in the hunt is often mentioned as a primary reason for the domestication of the wolf , and a 2004 study of hunter groups with and without a dog gives quantitative support to the hypothesis that the benefits of cooperative hunting was an important factor in wolf domestication .
near-infrared is the region closest in wavelength to the radiation detectable by the human eye , mid- and far-infrared are progressively further from the visible spectrum . other definitions follow different physical mechanisms ( emission peaks , vs. bands , water absorption ) and the newest follow technical reasons ( the common silicon detectors are sensitive to about 1,050 nm , while ingaas 's sensitivity starts around 950 nm and ends between 1,700 and 2,600 nm , depending on the specific configuration ) . unfortunately , international standards for these specifications are not currently available .
over the years a variety of record equalization practices emerged and there was no industry standard . for example , in europe recordings for years required playback with a bass turnover setting of 250-300 hz and a treble roll-off at 10,000 hz ranging from 0 to − 5 db or more . in the us there were more varied practices and a tendency to use higher bass turnover frequencies such as 500 hz as well as a greater treble rolloff like − 8.5 db and even more to record generally higher modulation levels on the record .
in september 2003 , a military coup was conducted . the military arrested iala on the charge of being " unable to solve the problems . " after being delayed several times , legislative elections were held in march 2004 . a mutiny of military factions in october 2004 resulted in the death of the head of the armed forces and caused widespread unrest .
the long-standing claim that the present uniform was first worn as mourning for the death of george iii is unfounded . " eton dress " has undergone significant changes since its standardisation in the 19th century . originally ( along with a top-hat and walking-cane ) , etonian dress was reserved for formal occasions , but boys wear it today for classes , which are referred to as " divisions , " or " divs . " as stated above , king 's scholars wear a black gown over the top of their tailcoats , and occasionally a surplice in chapel . members of the teaching staff ( known as beaks ) are required to wear a form of school dress when teaching .
in some design instances , materials used on walls and furniture play a key role in the lighting effect < for example dark paint tends to absorb light , making the room appear smaller and more dim than it is , whereas light paint does the opposite . in addition to paint , reflective surfaces also have an effect on lighting design .
on july 1 , 2014 , the university of notre dame and under armour reached an agreement in which under armour will provide uniforms , apparel , equipment , and monetary compensation to notre dame for 10 years . this contract , worth almost $ 100 million , is the most lucrative in the history of the ncaa . the university marching band plays at home games for most of the sports . the band , which began in 1846 and has a claim as the oldest university band in continuous existence in the united states , was honored by the national music council as a " landmark of american music " during the united states bicentennial . the band regularly plays the school 's fight song the notre dame victory march , which was named as the most played and most famous fight song by northern illinois professor william studwell . according to college fight songs : an annotated anthology published in 1998 , the " notre dame victory march " ranks as the greatest fight song of all time .
after the lengthy iraq disarmament crisis culminated with an american demand that iraqi president saddam hussein leave iraq , which was refused , a coalition led by the united states and the united kingdom fought the iraqi army in the 2003 invasion of iraq . approximately 250,000 united states troops , with support from 45,000 british , 2,000 australian and 200 polish combat forces , entered iraq primarily through their staging area in kuwait . ( turkey had refused to permit its territory to be used for an invasion from the north . ) coalition forces also supported iraqi kurdish militia , estimated to number upwards of 50,000 . after approximately three weeks of fighting , hussein and the ba 'ath party were forcibly removed , followed by 9 years of military presence by the united states and the coalition fighting alongside the newly elected iraqi government against various insurgent groups .
the endangered species conservation act ( p. l. 91-135 ) , passed in december , 1969 , amended the original law to provide additional protection to species in danger of " worldwide extinction " by prohibiting their importation and subsequent sale in the united states . it expanded the lacey act 's ban on interstate commerce to include mammals , reptiles , amphibians , mollusks and crustaceans . reptiles were added mainly to reduce the rampant poaching of alligators and crocodiles . this law was the first time that invertebrates were included for protection .
alexandria was the most important trade center in the whole empire during athanasius 's boyhood . intellectually , morally , and politically - it epitomized the ethnically diverse graeco-roman world , even more than rome or constantinople , antioch or marseilles . its famous catechetical school , while sacrificing none of its famous passion for orthodoxy since the days of pantaenus , clement of alexandria , origen of alexandria , dionysius and theognostus , had begun to take on an almost secular character in the comprehensiveness of its interests , and had counted influential pagans among its serious auditors .
representatives from indigenous and rural organizations from major south american countries , including bolivia , ecuador , colombia , chile and brazil , started a forum in support of morales ' legal process of change . the meeting condemned plans by the european " foreign power elite " to destabilize the country . the forum also expressed solidarity with the morales and his economic and social changes in the interest of historically marginalized majorities . furthermore , in a cathartic blow to the us-backed elite , it questioned us interference through diplomats and ngos . the forum was suspicious of plots against bolivia and other countries , including cuba , venezuela , ecuador , paraguay and nicaragua .
a wrestler may voluntarily submit by verbally informing the referee ( usually used in moves such as the mexican surfboard , where all four limbs are incapacitated , making tapping impossible ) . also , since ken shamrock ( a legitimate ufc competitor in its early days ) popularized it in 1997 , a wrestler can indicate a voluntary submission by " tapping out , " that is , tapping a free hand against the mat or against an opponent . occasionally , a wrestler will reach for a rope ( see rope breaks below ) , only to put their hand back on the mat so they can crawl towards the rope some more ; this is not a submission , and the referee decides what their intent is .
christopher orr , writing in the atlantic , also criticised the film , saying that spectre " backslides on virtually every [ aspect ] . " lawrence toppman of the charlotte observer called craig 's performance " bored , james bored . " alyssa rosenberg , writing for the washington post , stated that the film turned into " a disappointingly conventional bond film . "
after india gained independence in 1947 , a limited autonomy was conferred to new delhi and was administered by a chief commissioner appointed by the government of india . in 1956 , delhi was converted into a union territory and eventually the chief commissioner was replaced by a lieutenant governor . the constitution ( sixty-ninth amendment ) act , 1991 declared the union territory of delhi to be formally known as national capital territory of delhi . a system was introduced under which the elected government was given wide powers , excluding law and order which remained with the central government . the actual enforcement of the legislation came in 1993 .
romanesque art , especially metalwork , was at its most sophisticated in mosan art , in which distinct artistic personalities including nicholas of verdun ( d . 1205 ) become apparent , and an almost classical style is seen in works such as a font at liege , contrasting with the writhing animals of the exactly contemporary gloucester candlestick . large illuminated bibles and psalters were the typical forms of luxury manuscripts , and wall-painting flourished in churches , often following a scheme with a last judgement on the west wall , a christ in majesty at the east end , and narrative biblical scenes down the nave , or in the best surviving example , at saint-savin-sur-gartempe , on the barrel-vaulted roof .
relations between grand lodges are determined by the concept of recognition . each grand lodge maintains a list of other grand lodges that it recognises . when two grand lodges recognise and are in masonic communication with each other , they are said to be in amity , and the brethren of each may visit each other 's lodges and interact masonically . when two grand lodges are not in amity , inter-visitation is not allowed . there are many reasons why one grand lodge will withhold or withdraw recognition from another , but the two most common are exclusive jurisdiction and regularity .
encouraged by these successes , nintendo soon turned its attention to the north american market . nintendo entered into negotiations with atari to release the famicom under atari 's name as the name nintendo advanced video gaming system . the deal was set to be finalized and signed at the summer consumer electronics show in june 1983 . however , atari discovered at that show that its competitor coleco was illegally demonstrating its coleco adam computer with nintendo 's donkey kong game . this violation of atari 's exclusive license with nintendo to publish the game for its own computer systems delayed the implementation of nintendo 's game console marketing contract with atari . atari 's ceo ray kassar was fired the next month , so the deal went nowhere , and nintendo decided to market its system on its own.g [ › ]
moisture absorption occurs when the material is exposed to high humidity or water . both the resin and the reinforcement may absorb water ; water may be also soaked by capillary forces through voids in the materials and along the reinforcement . epoxies of the fr-4 materials aren 't too susceptible , with absorption of only 0.15 % . teflon has very low absorption of 0.01 % . polyimides and cyanate esters , on the other side , suffer from high water absorption . absorbed water can lead to significant degradation of key parameters ; it impairs tracking resistance , breakdown voltage , and dielectric parameters . relative dielectric constant of water is about 73 , compared to about 4 for common circuitboard materials . absorbed moisture can also vaporize on heating and cause cracking and delamination , the same effect responsible for " popcorning " damage on wet packaging of electronic parts . careful baking of the substrates may be required .
jehovah 's witnesses believe that god 's kingdom is a literal government in heaven , ruled by jesus christ and 144,000 " spirit-anointed " christians drawn from the earth , which they associate with jesus ' reference to a " new covenant . " the kingdom is viewed as the means by which god will accomplish his original purpose for the earth , transforming it into a paradise without sickness or death . it is said to have been the focal point of jesus ' ministry on earth . they believe the kingdom was established in heaven in 1914 , and that jehovah 's witnesses serve as representatives of the kingdom on earth .
on 23 april 2014 , the u.s. federal communications commission ( fcc ) was reported to be considering a new rule that will permit isps to offer content providers a faster track to send content , thus reversing their earlier net neutrality position . a possible solution to net neutrality concerns may be municipal broadband , according to professor susan crawford , a legal and technology expert at harvard law school . on 15 may 2014 , the fcc decided to consider two options regarding internet services : first , permit fast and slow broadband lanes , thereby compromising net neutrality ; and second , reclassify broadband as a telecommunication service , thereby preserving net neutrality . on 10 november 2014 , president barack obama recommended that the fcc reclassify broadband internet service as a telecommunications service in order to preserve net neutrality . on 16 january 2015 , republicans presented legislation , in the form of a u.s. congress h.r. discussion draft bill , that makes concessions to net neutrality but prohibits the fcc from accomplishing the goal or enacting any further regulation affecting internet service providers . on 31 january 2015 , ap news reported that the fcc will present the notion of applying ( " with some caveats " ) title ii ( common carrier ) of the communications act of 1934 to the internet in a vote expected on 26 february 2015 . adoption of this notion would reclassify internet service from one of information to one of the telecommunications and , according to tom wheeler , chairman of the fcc , ensure net neutrality . the fcc is expected to enforce net neutrality in its vote , according to the new york times .
the definition of antenna gain or power gain already includes the effect of the antenna 's efficiency . therefore , if one is trying to radiate a signal toward a receiver using a transmitter of a given power , one need only compare the gain of various antennas rather than considering the efficiency as well . this is likewise true for a receiving antenna at very high ( especially microwave ) frequencies , where the point is to receive a signal which is strong compared to the receiver 's noise temperature . however , in the case of a directional antenna used for receiving signals with the intention of rejecting interference from different directions , one is no longer concerned with the antenna efficiency , as discussed above . in this case , rather than quoting the antenna gain , one would be more concerned with the directive gain which does not include the effect of antenna ( in ) efficiency . the directive gain of an antenna can be computed from the published gain divided by the antenna 's efficiency .
in 1971 , tito was re-elected as president of yugoslavia by the federal assembly for the sixth time . in his speech before the federal assembly he introduced 20 sweeping constitutional amendments that would provide an updated framework on which the country would be based . the amendments provided for a collective presidency , a 22-member body consisting of elected representatives from six republics and two autonomous provinces . the body would have a single chairman of the presidency and chairmanship would rotate among six republics . when the federal assembly fails to agree on legislation , the collective presidency would have the power to rule by decree . amendments also provided for stronger cabinet with considerable power to initiate and pursue legislature independently from the communist party . dzemal bijedic was chosen as the premier . the new amendments aimed to decentralize the country by granting greater autonomy to republics and provinces . the federal government would retain authority only over foreign affairs , defense , internal security , monetary affairs , free trade within yugoslavia , and development loans to poorer regions . control of education , healthcare , and housing would be exercised entirely by the governments of the republics and the autonomous provinces .
philip ii was a strong and expansionist king and he took every opportunity to expand macedonian territory . in 352 bc he annexed thessaly and magnesia . in 338 bc , philip defeated a combined theban and athenian army at the battle of chaeronea after a decade of desultory conflict . in the aftermath , philip formed the league of corinth , effectively bringing the majority of greece under his direct sway . he was elected hegemon of the league , and a campaign against the achaemenid empire of persia was planned . however , while this campaign was in its early stages , he was assassinated .
the geographic features of rajasthan are the thar desert and the aravalli range , which runs through the state from southwest to northeast , almost from one end to the other , for more than 850 kilometres ( 530 mi ) . mount abu lies at the southwestern end of the range , separated from the main ranges by the west banas river , although a series of broken ridges continues into haryana in the direction of delhi where it can be seen as outcrops in the form of the raisina hill and the ridges farther north . about three-fifths of rajasthan lies northwest of the aravallis , leaving two-fifths on the east and south direction .
in an interrogative main clause the usual word order is : conjugated verb followed by subject ; other verbs in final position : " kun jij je pen niet vinden ? " ( literally " can you your pen not find ? " ) " can 't you find your pen ? "in the dutch equivalent of a wh-question the word order is : interrogative pronoun ( or expression ) + conjugated verb + subject ; other verbs in final position : " waarom kun jij je pen niet vinden ? " ( " why can you your pen not find ? " ) " why can 't you find your pen ? " "in a tag question the word order is the same as in a declarative clause : " jij kunt je pen niet vinden ? " ( " you can your pen not find ? " ) " you can 't find your pen ? " "a subordinate clause does not change its word order : " kun jij je pen niet vinden omdat het veel te donker is ? " ( " can you your pen not find because it far too dark is ? " ) " can you not find your pen because it 's too dark ? " "
the fa cup winners qualify for the following season 's uefa europa league ( formerly named the uefa cup ; until 1998 they entered the cup winners ' cup instead ) . this european place applies even if the team is relegated or is not in the english top flight . in the past , if the fa cup winning team also qualified for the following season 's champions league or europa league through their league position , then the losing fa cup finalist was given the europa league place instead . fa cup winners enter the europa league at the group stage . losing finalists , if they entered the europa league , began earlier , at the play-off or third qualifying round stage . from the 2015-16 uefa europa league season , however , uefa will not allow the runners-up to qualify for the europa league through the competition .
the london gazette of 17 march 1691 published a patent in favour of john lofting for a fire engine , but remarked upon and recommended another invention of his , for a beer pump :
the first roman republican wars were wars of both expansion and defence , aimed at protecting rome itself from neighbouring cities and nations and establishing its territory in the region . initially , rome 's immediate neighbours were either latin towns and villages , or else tribal sabines from the apennine hills beyond . one by one rome defeated both the persistent sabines and the local cities , both those under etruscan control and those that had cast off their etruscan rulers . rome defeated latin cities in the battle of lake regillus in 496 bc , the battle of mons algidus in 458 bc , the battle of corbione in 446 bc , the battle of aricia , and especially the battle of the cremera in 477 bc wherein it fought against the most important etruscan city of veii .
in charleston , the african american population increased as freedmen moved from rural areas to the major city : from 17,000 in 1860 to over 27,000 in 1880 . historian eric foner noted that blacks were glad to be relieved of the many regulations of slavery and to operate outside of white surveillance . among other changes , most blacks quickly left the southern baptist church , setting up their own black baptist congregations or joining new african methodist episcopal church and ame zion churches , both independent black denominations first established in the north . freedmen " acquired dogs , guns , and liquor ( all barred to them under slavery ) , and refused to yield the sidewalks to whites . "
carnivore was an electronic eavesdropping software system implemented by the fbi during the clinton administration ; it was designed to monitor email and electronic communications . after prolonged negative coverage in the press , the fbi changed the name of its system from " carnivore " to " dcs1000 . " dcs is reported to stand for " digital collection system " ; the system has the same functions as before . the associated press reported in mid-january 2005 that the fbi essentially abandoned the use of carnivore in 2001 , in favor of commercially available software , such as narusinsight .
in 1984 , each league had two divisions , east and west . the divisional winners met in a best-of-5 series to advance to the world series , in a " 2-3 " format , first two games were played at the home of the team who did not have home field advantage . then the last three games were played at the home of the team , with home field advantage . thus the first two games were played at wrigley field and the next three at the home of their opponents , san diego . a common and unfounded myth is that since wrigley field did not have lights at that time the national league decided to give the home field advantage to the winner of the nl west . in fact , home field advantage had rotated between the winners of the east and west since 1969 when the league expanded . in even numbered years , the nl west had home field advantage . in odd numbered years , the nl east had home field advantage . since the nl east winners had had home field advantage in 1983 , the nl west winners were entitled to it .
armenia is a unitary , multi-party , democratic nation-state with an ancient cultural heritage . urartu was established in 860 bc and by the 6th century bc it was replaced by the satrapy of armenia . in the 1st century bc the kingdom of armenia reached its height under tigranes the great . armenia became the first state in the world to adopt christianity as its official religion . in between the late 3rd century to early years of the 4th century , the state became the first christian nation . the official date of state adoption of christianity is 301 ad . the ancient armenian kingdom was split between the byzantine and sasanian empires around the early 5th century .
in the iconoclastic era , figural mosaics were also condemned as idolatry . the iconoclastic churches were embellished with plain gold mosaics with only one great cross in the apse like the hagia irene in constantinople ( after 740 ) . there were similar crosses in the apses of the hagia sophia church in thessaloniki and in the church of the dormition in nicaea . the crosses were substituted with the image of the theotokos in both churches after the victory of the iconodules ( 787-797 and in 8th-9th centuries respectively , the dormition church was totally destroyed in 1922 ) .
pius xii asked archbishop montini to rome october 1957 , where he gave the main presentation to the second world congress of lay apostolate . previously as pro-secretary , he had worked hard to unify a worldwide organization of lay people of 58 nations , representing 42 national organizations . he presented them to pius xii in rome in 1951 . the second meeting in 1957 gave montini an opportunity to express the lay apostolate in modern terms : " apostolate means love . we will love all , but especially those , who need help ... we will love our time , our technology , our art , our sports , our world . "
bacteria do not have a membrane-bound nucleus , and their genetic material is typically a single circular dna chromosome located in the cytoplasm in an irregularly shaped body called the nucleoid . the nucleoid contains the chromosome with its associated proteins and rna . the phylum planctomycetes and candidate phylum poribacteria may be exceptions to the general absence of internal membranes in bacteria , because they appear to have a double membrane around their nucleoids and contain other membrane-bound cellular structures . like all living organisms , bacteria contain ribosomes , often grouped in chains called polyribosomes , for the production of proteins , but the structure of the bacterial ribosome is different from that of eukaryotes and archaea . bacterial ribosomes have a sedimentation rate of 70s ( measured in svedberg units ) : their subunits have rates of 30s and 50s . some antibiotics bind specifically to 70s ribosomes and inhibit bacterial protein synthesis . those antibiotics kill bacteria without affecting the larger 80s ribosomes of eukaryotic cells and without harming the host .
philip ii of spain decreed the change from the julian to the gregorian calendar , which affected much of roman catholic europe , as philip was at the time ruler over spain and portugal as well as much of italy . in these territories , as well as in the polish-lithuanian commonwealth ( ruled by anna jagiellon ) and in the papal states , the new calendar was implemented on the date specified by the bull , with julian thursday , 4 october 1582 , being followed by gregorian friday , 15 october 1582 . the spanish and portuguese colonies followed somewhat later de facto because of delay in communication .
the city of charleston is served by the charleston international airport . it is located in the city of north charleston and is about 12 miles ( 20 km ) northwest of downtown charleston . it is the busiest passenger airport in south carolina ( iata : chs , icao : kchs ) . the airport shares runways with the adjacent charleston air force base . charleston executive airport is a smaller airport located in the john 's island section of the city of charleston and is used by noncommercial aircraft . both airports are owned and operated by the charleston county aviation authority .
the current " precentor " ( head of music ) is tim johnson , and the school boasts eight organs and an entire building for music ( performance spaces include the school hall , the farrer theatre and two halls dedicated to music , the parry hall and the concert hall ) . many instruments are taught , including obscure ones such as the didgeridoo . the school participates in many national competitions ; many pupils are part of the national youth orchestra , and the school gives scholarships for dedicated and talented musicians . a former precentor of the college , ralph allwood set up and organised eton choral courses , which run at the school every summer .
the multitude of middle iranian languages and peoples indicate that great linguistic diversity must have existed among the ancient speakers of iranian languages . of that variety of languages / dialects , direct evidence of only two have survived . these are :
in his harvard " lectures on pragmatism " ( 1903 ) , peirce enumerated what he called the " three cotary propositions of pragmatism " ( l : cos , cotis whetstone ) , saying that they " put the edge on the maxim of pragmatism . " first among these he listed the peripatetic-thomist observation mentioned above , but he further observed that this link between sensory perception and intellectual conception is a two-way street . that is , it can be taken to say that whatever we find in the intellect is also incipiently in the senses . hence , if theories are theory-laden then so are the senses , and perception itself can be seen as a species of abductive inference , its difference being that it is beyond control and hence beyond critique - in a word , incorrigible . this in no way conflicts with the fallibility and revisability of scientific concepts , since it is only the immediate percept in its unique individuality or " thisness " - what the scholastics called its haecceity - that stands beyond control and correction . scientific concepts , on the other hand , are general in nature , and transient sensations do in another sense find correction within them . this notion of perception as abduction has received periodic revivals in artificial intelligence and cognitive science research , most recently for instance with the work of irvin rock on indirect perception .
callaghan had been widely expected to call a general election in the autumn of 1978 when most opinion polls showed labour to have a narrow lead . however he decided to extend his wage restraint policy for another year hoping that the economy would be in a better shape for a 1979 election . but during the winter of 1978-79 there were widespread strikes among lorry drivers , railway workers , car workers and local government and hospital workers in favour of higher pay-rises that caused significant disruption to everyday life . these events came to be dubbed the " winter of discontent . "
the asa standard underwent a major revision in 1960 with asa ph2.5-1960 , when the method to determine film speed was refined and previously applied safety factors against under-exposure were abandoned , effectively doubling the nominal speed of many black-and-white negative films . for example , an ilford hp3 that had been rated at 200 asa before 1960 was labeled 400 asa afterwards without any change to the emulsion . similar changes were applied to the din system with din 4512 : 1961-10 and the bs system with bs 1380 : 1963 in the following years .
it is also known as the wenchuan earthquake ( chinese : 汶川大地震 ; pinyin : wenchuan da dizhen ; literally : " great wenchuan earthquake " ) , after the location of the earthquake 's epicenter , wenchuan county , sichuan . the epicenter was 80 kilometres ( 50 mi ) west-northwest of chengdu , the provincial capital , with a focal depth of 19 km ( 12 mi ) . the earthquake was also felt in nearby countries and as far away as both beijing and shanghai - 1,500 km ( 930 mi ) and 1,700 km ( 1,060 mi ) away - where office buildings swayed with the tremor . strong aftershocks , some exceeding magnitude 6 , continued to hit the area even months after the main quake , causing new casualties and damage .
an important guiding principle of buddhist practice is the middle way ( or middle path ) , which is said to have been discovered by gautama buddha prior to his enlightenment . the middle way has several definitions :
in a 1986 interview , rocky jones , the former club dj who ran the d.j. international record label , doesn 't mention importes etc . , frankie knuckles , or the warehouse by name , but agrees that " house " was a regional catch-all term for dance music , and that it was once synonymous with older disco music .
the sangoma is a traditional diviner chosen by the ancestors of that particular family . the training of the sangoma is called " kwetfwasa . " at the end of the training , a graduation ceremony takes place where all the local sangoma come together for feasting and dancing . the diviner is consulted for various reasons , such the cause of sickness or even death . his diagnosis is based on " kubhula , " a process of communication , through trance , with the natural superpowers . the inyanga ( a medical and pharmaceutical specialist in western terms ) possesses the bone throwing skill ( " kushaya ematsambo " ) used to determine the cause of the sickness .
in 1803 , an act of parliament , promoted by the east india company , established the east india dock company , with the aim of establishing a new set of docks ( the east india docks ) primarily for the use of ships trading with india . the existing brunswick dock , part of the blackwall yard site , became the export dock ; while a new import dock was built to the north . in 1838 the east india dock company merged with the west india dock company . the docks were taken over by the port of london authority in 1909 , and closed in 1967 .
during the tumultuous 14th century , disputes within the leadership of the church led to the avignon papacy of 1305-78 , also called the " babylonian captivity of the papacy " ( a reference to the babylonian captivity of the jews ) , and then to the great schism , lasting from 1378 to 1418 , when there were two and later three rival popes , each supported by several states . ecclesiastical officials convened at the council of constance in 1414 , and in the following year the council deposed one of the rival popes , leaving only two claimants . further depositions followed , and in november 1417 the council elected martin v ( pope 1417-31 ) as pope .
homo sapiens reached the region by around 45,000 years ago , having moved eastwards from the indian subcontinent . homo floresiensis also lived in the area up until 12,000 years ago , when they became extinct . austronesian people , who form the majority of the modern population in indonesia , malaysia , brunei , east timor , and the philippines , may have migrated to southeast asia from taiwan . they arrived in indonesia around 2000 bc , and as they spread through the archipelago , they often settled along coastal areas and confined indigenous peoples such as negritos of the philippines or papuans of new guinea to inland regions .
during the 19th century , paris was the home and subject for some of france 's greatest writers , including charles baudelaire , stephane mallarme , merimee , alfred de musset , marcel proust , emile zola , alexandre dumas , gustave flaubert , guy de maupassant and honore de balzac . victor hugo 's the hunchback of notre dame inspired the renovation of its setting , the notre-dame de paris . another of victor hugo 's works , les miserables , written while he was in exile outside france during the second empire , described the social change and political turmoil in paris in the early 1830s . one of the most popular of all french writers , jules verne , worked at the theatre lyrique and the paris stock exchange , while he did research for his stories at the national library .
from circa 1932 until 1977 , general electric polluted the housatonic river with pcbs discharges from the general electric plant at pittsfield , massachusetts . aroclor 1254 and aroclor 1260 , made by monsanto was the primary contaminant of the pollution . the highest concentrations of pcbs in the housatonic river are found in woods pond in lenox , massachusetts , just south of pittsfield , where they have been measured up to 110 mg / kg in the sediment . about 50 % of all the pcbs currently in the river are estimated to be retained in the sediment behind woods pond dam . this is estimated to be about 11,000 pounds of pcbs . former filled oxbows are also polluted . waterfowl and fish who live in and around the river contain significant levels of pcbs and can present health risks if consumed .
the landscapes of thuringia are quite diverse . the far north is occupied by the harz mountains , followed by the goldene aue , a fertile floodplain around nordhausen with the helme as most important river . the north-west includes the eichsfeld , a hilly and sometimes forested region , where the leine river emanates . the central and northern part of thuringia is defined by the 3000 km ² wide thuringian basin , a very fertile and flat area around the unstrut river and completely surrounded by the following hill chains ( clockwise from the north-west ) : dun , hainleite , windleite , kyffhauser , hohe schrecke , schmucke , finne , ettersberg , steigerwald , thuringian forest , horselberge and hainich . within the basin the smaller hill chains fahner hohe and heilinger hohen . south of the thuringian basin is the land 's largest mountain range , marked by the thuringian forest in the north-west , the thuringian highland in the middle and the franconian forest in the south-east . most of this range is forested and the großer beerberg ( 983 m ) is thuringia 's highest mountain . to the south-west , the forest is followed up by werra river valley , dividing it from the rhon mountains in the west and the grabfeld plain in the south . eastern thuringia , commonly described as the area east of saale and loquitz valley , is marked by a hilly landscape , rising slowly from the flat north to the mountainous south . the saale in the west and the weiße elster in the east are the two big rivers running from south to north and forming densely settled valleys in this area . between them lies the flat and forested holzland in the north , the flat and fertile orlasenke in the middle and the vogtland , a hilly but in most parts non-forested region in the south . the far eastern region ( east of weiße elster ) is the osterland or altenburger land along pleiße river , a flat , fertile and densely settled agricultural area .
high-voltage ac overhead systems are not only for standard gauge national networks . the meter gauge rhaetian railway ( rhb ) and the neighbouring matterhorn gotthard bahn ( mgb ) operate on 11 kv at 16.7 hz frequency . practice has proven that both swiss and german 15 kv trains can operate under these lower voltages . the rhb started trials of the 11 kv system in 1913 on the engadin line ( st. moritz-scuol / tarasp ) . the mgb constituents furka-oberalp-bahn ( fo ) and brig-visp-zermatt bahn ( bvz ) introduced their electric services in 1941 and 1929 respectively , adopting the already proven rhb system .
it was believed that when people died , they would be confined to a gloomy world of ereshkigal , whose realm was guarded by gateways with various monsters designed to prevent people entering or leaving . the dead were buried outside the city walls in graveyards where a small mound covered the corpse , along with offerings to monsters and a small amount of food . those who could afford it sought burial at dilmun . human sacrifice was found in the death pits at the ur royal cemetery where queen puabi was accompanied in death by her servants . it is also said that the sumerians invented the first oboe-like instrument , and used them at royal funerals .
smith 's first macintosh board was built to raskin 's design specifications : it had 64 kilobytes ( kb ) of ram , used the motorola 6809e microprocessor , and was capable of supporting a 256 × 256-pixel black-and-white bitmap display . bud tribble , a member of the mac team , was interested in running the apple lisa 's graphical programs on the macintosh , and asked smith whether he could incorporate the lisa 's motorola 68000 microprocessor into the mac while still keeping the production cost down . by december 1980 , smith had succeeded in designing a board that not only used the 68000 , but increased its speed from 5 mhz to 8 mhz ; this board also had the capacity to support a 384 × 256-pixel display . smith 's design used fewer ram chips than the lisa , which made production of the board significantly more cost-efficient . the final mac design was self-contained and had the complete quickdraw picture language and interpreter in 64 kb of rom - far more than most other computers ; it had 128 kb of ram , in the form of sixteen 64 kilobit ( kb ) ram chips soldered to the logicboard . though there were no memory slots , its ram was expandable to 512 kb by means of soldering sixteen ic sockets to accept 256 kb ram chips in place of the factory-installed chips . the final product 's screen was a 9-inch , 512x342 pixel monochrome display , exceeding the size of the planned screen .
since 1898 , puerto rico has had limited representation in the congress in the form of a resident commissioner , a nonvoting delegate . the 110th congress returned the commissioner 's power to vote in the committee of the whole , but not on matters where the vote would represent a decisive participation . puerto rico has elections on the united states presidential primary or caucus of the democratic party and the republican party to select delegates to the respective parties ' national conventions although presidential electors are not granted on the electoral college . as american citizens , puerto ricans can vote in u.s. presidential elections , provided they reside in one of the 50 states or the district of columbia and not in puerto rico itself .
mary 's complete sinlessness and concomitant exemption from any taint from the first moment of her existence was a doctrine familiar to greek theologians of byzantium . beginning with st. gregory nazianzen , his explanation of the " purification " of jesus and mary at the circumcision ( luke 2 : 22 ) prompted him to consider the primary meaning of " purification " in christology ( and by extension in mariology ) to refer to a perfectly sinless nature that manifested itself in glory in a moment of grace ( e.g. , jesus at his baptism ) . st. gregory nazianzen designated mary as " prokathartheisa ( prepurified ) . " gregory likely attempted to solve the riddle of the purification of jesus and mary in the temple through considering the human natures of jesus and mary as equally holy and therefore both purified in this manner of grace and glory . gregory 's doctrines surrounding mary 's purification were likely related to the burgeoning commemoration of the mother of god in and around constantinople very close to the date of christmas . nazianzen 's title of mary at the annunciation as " prepurified " was subsequently adopted by all theologians interested in his mariology to justify the byzantine equivalent of the immaculate conception . this is especially apparent in the fathers st. sophronios of jerusalem and st. john damascene , who will be treated below in this article at the section on church fathers . about the time of damascene , the public celebration of the " conception of st. ann [ i.e. , of the theotokos in her womb ] " was becoming popular . after this period , the " purification " of the perfect natures of jesus and mary would not only mean moments of grace and glory at the incarnation and baptism and other public byzantine liturgical feasts , but purification was eventually associated with the feast of mary 's very conception ( along with her presentation in the temple as a toddler ) by orthodox authors of the 2nd millennium ( e.g. , st. nicholas cabasilas and joseph bryennius ) .
the earliest record of the location appears as sao joao on a portuguese map by pedro reinel in 1519 . when john rut visited st. john 's in 1527 he found norman , breton and portuguese ships in the harbour . on 3 august 1527 , rut wrote a letter to king henry on the findings of his voyage to north america ; this was the first known letter sent from north america . st. jehan is shown on nicholas desliens ' world map of 1541 and san joham is found in joao freire 's atlas of 1546 . it was during this time that water street was first developed , making it the oldest street in north america .

the city 's location was chosen , in part , for being within 11 mi ( 18 km ) of isaac hunter 's tavern , a popular tavern frequented by the state legislators . no known city or town existed previously on the chosen city site . raleigh is one of the few cities in the united states that was planned and built specifically to serve as a state capital . its original boundaries were formed by the downtown streets of north , east , west and south streets . the plan , a grid with two main axes meeting at a central square and an additional square in each corner , was based on thomas holme 's 1682 plan for philadelphia .
the city 's growing latino population has given rise to a number of local and regional spanish-language newspapers . these include el planeta ( owned by the former publisher of the boston phoenix ) , el mundo , and la semana . siglo21 , with its main offices in nearby lawrence , is also widely distributed .
in the international phonetic alphabet ( ipa ) , aspirated consonants are written using the symbols for voiceless consonants followed by the aspiration modifier letter ⟨ ◌ ʰ ⟩ , a superscript form of the symbol for the voiceless glottal fricative ⟨ h ⟩ . for instance , ⟨ p ⟩ represents the voiceless bilabial stop , and ⟨ pʰ ⟩ represents the aspirated bilabial stop .
on saturday september 6 , 1997 the formal , though not " state " funeral of diana , princess of wales , was held . it was a royal ceremonial funeral including royal pageantry and anglican funeral liturgy . a second public service was held on sunday at the demand of the people . the burial occurred privately later the same day . diana 's former husband , sons , mother , siblings , a close friend , and a clergyman were present . diana 's body was clothed in a black long-sleeved dress designed by catherine walker , which she had chosen some weeks before . a set of rosary beads was placed in her hands , a gift she had received from mother teresa . her grave is on the grounds of her family estate , althorp , on a private island .

public opinion pressured the u.s. government to bring villa to justice for the raid on columbus , new mexico ; u.s. president wilson sent gen. john j. pershing and some 5,000 troops into mexico in an unsuccessful attempt to capture villa . it was known as the punitive expedition . after nearly a year of pursuing villa , american forces returned to the united states . the american intervention had been limited to the western sierras of chihuahua . villa had the advantage of intimately knowing the inhospitable terrain of the sonoran desert and the almost impassable sierra madre mountains and always managed to stay one step ahead of his pursuers . in 1923 villa was assassinated by a group of seven gunmen who ambushed him while he was sitting in the back seat of his car in parral .
the rivers form lakes , such as lake geneva , a crescent shaped lake crossing the swiss border with lausanne on the swiss side and the town of evian-les-bains on the french side . in germany , the medieval st. bartholomew 's chapel was built on the south side of the konigssee , accessible only by boat or by climbing over the abutting peaks .
muslim scientists contributed to advances in the sciences . they placed far greater emphasis on experiment than had the greeks . this led to an early scientific method being developed in the muslim world , where progress in methodology was made , beginning with the experiments of ibn al-haytham ( alhazen ) on optics from circa 1000 , in his book of optics . the most important development of the scientific method was the use of experiments to distinguish between competing scientific theories set within a generally empirical orientation , which began among muslim scientists . ibn al-haytham is also regarded as the father of optics , especially for his empirical proof of the intromission theory of light . some have also described ibn al-haytham as the " first scientist . " al-khwarzimi 's invented the log base systems that are being used today , he also contributed theorems in trigonometry as well as limits . recent studies show that it is very likely that the medieval muslim artists were aware of advanced decagonal quasicrystal geometry ( discovered half a millennium later in the 1970s and 1980s in the west ) and used it in intricate decorative tilework in the architecture .
each republican magistrate held certain constitutional powers . only the people of rome ( both plebeians and patricians ) had the right to confer these powers on any individual magistrate . the most powerful constitutional power was imperium . imperium was held by both consuls and praetors . imperium gave a magistrate the authority to command a military force . all magistrates also had the power of coercion . this was used by magistrates to maintain public order . while in rome , all citizens had a judgement against coercion . this protection was called provocatio ( see below ) . magistrates also had both the power and the duty to look for omens . this power would often be used to obstruct political opponents .
estonia has had a market economy since the end of the 1990s and one of the highest per capita income levels in eastern europe . proximity to the scandinavian markets , its location between the east and west , competitive cost structure and a highly skilled labour force have been the major estonian comparative advantages in the beginning of the 2000s ( decade ) . as the largest city , tallinn has emerged as a financial centre and the tallinn stock exchange joined recently with the omx system . the current government has pursued tight fiscal policies , resulting in balanced budgets and low public debt .
heat is energy in transit that flows due to temperature difference . unlike heat transmitted by thermal conduction or thermal convection , thermal radiation can propagate through a vacuum . thermal radiation is characterized by a particular spectrum of many wavelengths that is associated with emission from an object , due to the vibration of its molecules at a given temperature . thermal radiation can be emitted from objects at any wavelength , and at very high temperatures such radiations are associated with spectra far above the infrared , extending into visible , ultraviolet , and even x-ray regions ( i.e. , the solar corona ) . thus , the popular association of infrared radiation with thermal radiation is only a coincidence based on typical ( comparatively low ) temperatures often found near the surface of planet earth .
catalan is split in two major dialectal blocks : eastern catalan , and western catalan . the main difference lies in the treatment of unstressed a and e ; which have merged to / ə / in eastern dialects , but which remain distinct as / a / and / e / in western dialects . there are a few other differences in pronunciation , verbal morphology , and vocabulary .
in january 2013 , destiny 's child released love songs , a compilation album of the romance-themed songs from their previous albums and a newly recorded track , " nuclear . " beyonce performed the american national anthem singing along with a pre-recorded track at president obama 's second inauguration in washington , d.c. the following month , beyonce performed at the super bowl xlvii halftime show , held at the mercedes-benz superdome in new orleans . the performance stands as the second most tweeted about moment in history at 268,000 tweets per minute . at the 55th annual grammy awards , beyonce won for best traditional r & b performance for " love on top . " her feature-length documentary film , life is but a dream , first aired on hbo on february 16 , 2013 . the film , which she directed and produced herself , featured footage from her childhood , her as a mother and businesswoman , recording , rehearsing for live performances , and her return to the spotlight following blue ivy 's birth . its dvd release in november 2013 was accompanied by footage from the revel presents : beyonce live concerts and a new song , " god made you beautiful . " in february 2013 , beyonce signed a global publishing agreement with warner / chappell music , which would cover her future songwriting and then-upcoming studio album .
for the commercial naming of a product , the frame rate is often dropped and is implied from context ( e.g. , a 1080i television set ) . a frame rate can also be specified without a resolution . for example , 24p means 24 progressive scan frames per second , and 50i means 25 interlaced frames per second .
the first grand lodge , the grand lodge of london and westminster ( later called the grand lodge of england ( gle ) ) , was founded on 24 june 1717 , when four existing london lodges met for a joint dinner . many english lodges joined the new regulatory body , which itself entered a period of self-publicity and expansion . however , many lodges could not endorse changes which some lodges of the gle made to the ritual ( they came to be known as the moderns ) , and a few of these formed a rival grand lodge on 17 july 1751 , which they called the " antient grand lodge of england . " these two grand lodges vied for supremacy until the moderns promised to return to the ancient ritual . they united on 27 december 1813 to form the united grand lodge of england ( ugle ) .
new york 's airspace is the busiest in the united states and one of the world 's busiest air transportation corridors . the three busiest airports in the new york metropolitan area include john f. kennedy international airport , newark liberty international airport , and laguardia airport ; 109 million travelers used these three airports in 2012 , and the city 's airspace is the busiest in the nation . jfk and newark liberty were the busiest and fourth busiest u.s. gateways for international air passengers , respectively , in 2012 ; as of 2011 , jfk was the busiest airport for international passengers in north america . plans have advanced to expand passenger volume at a fourth airport , stewart international airport near newburgh , new york , by the port authority of new york and new jersey . plans were announced in july 2015 to entirely rebuild laguardia airport in a multibillion-dollar project to replace its aging facilities .
in august 2007 , an increase in the price of diesel and petrol led to saffron revolution led by buddhist monks that were dealt with harshly by the government . the government cracked down on them on 26 september 2007 . the crackdown was harsh , with reports of barricades at the shwedagon pagoda and monks killed . there were also rumours of disagreement within the burmese armed forces , but none was confirmed . the military crackdown against unarmed protesters was widely condemned as part of the international reactions to the saffron revolution and led to an increase in economic sanctions against the burmese government .
the competition is open to any eligible club down to levels 10 of the english football league system - all 92 professional clubs in the premier league and football league ( levels 1 to 4 ) , and several hundred " non-league " teams in steps 1 to 6 of the national league system ( levels 5 to 10 ) . a record 763 clubs competed in 2011-12 . the tournament consists of 12 randomly drawn rounds followed by the semi-finals and the final . entrants are not seeded , although a system of byes based on league level ensures higher ranked teams enter in later rounds - the minimum number of games needed to win the competition ranges from six to fourteen .
as an electro-magnetic wave travels through the different parts of the antenna system ( radio , feed line , antenna , free space ) it may encounter differences in impedance ( e / h , v / i , etc . ) . at each interface , depending on the impedance match , some fraction of the wave 's energy will reflect back to the source , forming a standing wave in the feed line . the ratio of maximum power to minimum power in the wave can be measured and is called the standing wave ratio ( swr ) . a swr of 1 : 1 is ideal . a swr of 1.5 : 1 is considered to be marginally acceptable in low power applications where power loss is more critical , although an swr as high as 6 : 1 may still be usable with the right equipment . minimizing impedance differences at each interface ( impedance matching ) will reduce swr and maximize power transfer through each part of the antenna system .
red wine may offer health benefits more so than white because potentially beneficial compounds are present in grape skin , and only red wine is fermented with skins . the amount of fermentation time a wine spends in contact with grape skins is an important determinant of its resveratrol content . ordinary non-muscadine red wine contains between 0.2 and 5.8 mg / l , depending on the grape variety , because it is fermented with the skins , allowing the wine to absorb the resveratrol . by contrast , a white wine contains lower phenolic contents because it is fermented after removal of skins .
to maintain a high constant body temperature is energy expensive - mammals therefore need a nutritious and plentiful diet . while the earliest mammals were probably predators , different species have since adapted to meet their dietary requirements in a variety of ways . some eat other animals - this is a carnivorous diet ( and includes insectivorous diets ) . other mammals , called herbivores , eat plants . a herbivorous diet includes subtypes such as fruit-eating and grass-eating . an omnivore eats both prey and plants . carnivorous mammals have a simple digestive tract , because the proteins , lipids , and minerals found in meat require little in the way of specialized digestion . plants , on the other hand , contain complex carbohydrates , such as cellulose . the digestive tract of an herbivore is therefore host to bacteria that ferment these substances , and make them available for digestion . the bacteria are either housed in the multichambered stomach or in a large cecum . the size of an animal is also a factor in determining diet type . since small mammals have a high ratio of heat-losing surface area to heat-generating volume , they tend to have high energy requirements and a high metabolic rate . mammals that weigh less than about 18 oz ( 500 g ) are mostly insectivorous because they cannot tolerate the slow , complex digestive process of a herbivore . larger animals , on the other hand , generate more heat and less of this heat is lost . they can therefore tolerate either a slower collection process ( those that prey on larger vertebrates ) or a slower digestive process ( herbivores ) . furthermore , mammals that weigh more than 18 oz ( 500 g ) usually cannot collect enough insects during their waking hours to sustain themselves . the only large insectivorous mammals are those that feed on huge colonies of insects ( ants or termites ) .
the most familiar , and historically the oldest , types of glass are " silicate glasses " based on the chemical compound silica ( silicon dioxide , or quartz ) , the primary constituent of sand . the term glass , in popular usage , is often used to refer only to this type of material , which is familiar from use as window glass and in glass bottles . of the many silica-based glasses that exist , ordinary glazing and container glass is formed from a specific type called soda-lime glass , composed of approximately 75 % silicon dioxide ( sio2 ) , sodium oxide ( na2o ) from sodium carbonate ( na2co3 ) , calcium oxide , also called lime ( cao ) , and several minor additives . a very clear and durable quartz glass can be made from pure silica , but the high melting point and very narrow glass transition of quartz make glassblowing and hot working difficult . in glasses like soda lime , the compounds added to quartz are used to lower the melting temperature and improve workability , at a cost in the toughness , thermal stability , and optical transmittance .
according to a tradition first reported by sulcard in about 1080 , a church was founded at the site ( then known as thorn ey ( thorn island ) ) in the 7th century , at the time of mellitus , a bishop of london . construction of the present church began in 1245 , on the orders of king henry iii .
people of german origin are found in various places around the globe . united states is home to approximately 50 million german americans or one third of the german diaspora , making it the largest centre of german-descended people outside germany . brazil is the second largest with 5 million people claiming german ancestry . other significant centres are canada , argentina , south africa and france each accounting for at least 1 million . while the exact number of german-descended people is difficult to calculate , the available data makes it safe to claim the number is exceeding 100 million people .
seattle was also the home base of impresario alexander pantages who , starting in 1902 , opened a number of theaters in the city exhibiting vaudeville acts and silent movies . his activities soon expanded , and the thrifty greek went on and became one of america 's greatest theater and movie tycoons . between pantages and his rival john considine , seattle was for a while the western united states ' vaudeville mecca . b. marcus priteca , the scottish-born and seattle-based architect , built several theaters for pantages , including some in seattle . the theaters he built for pantages in seattle have been either demolished or converted to other uses , but many other theaters survive in other cities of the u.s. , often retaining the pantages name ; seattle 's surviving paramount theatre , on which he collaborated , was not a pantages theater .
the earliest disc records ( 1889-1894 ) were made of various materials including hard rubber . around 1895 , a shellac-based compound was introduced and became standard . exact formulas for this compound varied by manufacturer and over the course of time , but it was typically composed of about one-third shellac and about two-thirds mineral filler , which meant finely pulverized rock , usually slate and limestone , with an admixture of cotton fibers to add tensile strength , carbon black for color ( without this , it tended to be a " dirty " gray or brown color that most record companies considered unattractive ) , and a very small amount of a lubricant to facilitate mold release during manufacture . some makers , notably columbia records , used a laminated construction with a core disc of coarser material or fiber . the production of shellac records continued until the end of the 78 rpm format ( i.e. , the late 1950s in most developed countries , but well into the 1960s in some other places ) , but increasingly less abrasive formulations were used during its declining years and very late examples in truly like-new condition can have as low noise levels as vinyl .
the kinsey scale provides a classification of sexual orientation based on the relative amounts of heterosexual and homosexual experience or psychic response in one 's history at a given time . the classification scheme works such that individuals in the same category show the same balance between the heterosexual and homosexual elements in their histories . the position on the scale is based on the relation of heterosexuality to homosexuality in one 's history , rather than the actual amount of overt experience or psychic response . an individual can be assigned a position on the scale in accordance with the following definitions of the points of the scale :
dietary fiber is a carbohydrate that is incompletely absorbed in humans and in some animals . like all carbohydrates , when it is metabolized it can produce four calories ( kilocalories ) of energy per gram . however , in most circumstances it accounts for less than that because of its limited absorption and digestibility . dietary fiber consists mainly of cellulose , a large carbohydrate polymer which is indigestible as humans do not have the required enzymes to disassemble it . there are two subcategories : soluble and insoluble fiber . whole grains , fruits ( especially plums , prunes , and figs ) , and vegetables are good sources of dietary fiber . there are many health benefits of a high-fiber diet . dietary fiber helps reduce the chance of gastrointestinal problems such as constipation and diarrhea by increasing the weight and size of stool and softening it . insoluble fiber , found in whole wheat flour , nuts and vegetables , especially stimulates peristalsis - the rhythmic muscular contractions of the intestines , which move digesta along the digestive tract . soluble fiber , found in oats , peas , beans , and many fruits , dissolves in water in the intestinal tract to produce a gel that slows the movement of food through the intestines . this may help lower blood glucose levels because it can slow the absorption of sugar . additionally , fiber , perhaps especially that from whole grains , is thought to possibly help lessen insulin spikes , and therefore reduce the risk of type 2 diabetes . the link between increased fiber consumption and a decreased risk of colorectal cancer is still uncertain .
in 1630 , pope urban viii decreed their title to be eminence ( previously , it had been " illustrissimo " and " reverendissimo " ) and decreed that their secular rank would equate to prince , making them secondary only to the pope and crowned monarchs .
portugal has several summer music festivals , such as festival sudoeste in zambujeira do mar , festival de paredes de coura in paredes de coura , festival vilar de mouros near caminha , boom festival in idanha-a-nova municipality , optimus alive ! , sumol summer fest in ericeira , rock in rio lisboa and super bock super rock in greater lisbon . out of the summer season , portugal has a large number of festivals , designed more to an urban audience , like flowfest or hip hop porto . furthermore , one of the largest international goa trance festivals takes place in central portugal every two years , the boom festival , that is also the only festival in portugal to win international awards : european festival award 2010 - green 'n'clean festival of the year and the greener festival award outstanding 2008 and 2010 . there is also the student festivals of queima das fitas are major events in a number of cities across portugal . in 2005 , portugal held the mtv europe music awards , in pavilhao atlantico , lisbon .
in the 1980s green became the color of a number of new european political parties organized around an agenda of environmentalism . green was chosen for its association with nature , health , and growth . the largest green party in europe is alliance ' 90 / the greens ( german : bundnis 90 / die grunen ) in germany , which was formed in 1993 from the merger of the german green party , founded in west germany in 1980 , and alliance 90 , founded during the revolution of 1989-1990 in east germany . in the 2009 federal elections , the party won 10.7 % of the votes and 68 out of 622 seats in the bundestag .
on the domestic front , he covertly opposed joseph mccarthy and contributed to the end of mccarthyism by openly invoking the modern expanded version of executive privilege . he otherwise left most political activity to his vice president , richard nixon . he was a moderate conservative who continued new deal agencies and expanded social security . he also launched the interstate highway system , the defense advanced research projects agency ( darpa ) , the establishment of strong science education via the national defense education act , and encouraged peaceful use of nuclear power via amendments to the atomic energy act .
at over 5 million , puerto ricans are easily the 2nd largest hispanic group . of all major hispanic groups , puerto ricans are the least likely to be proficient in spanish , but millions of puerto rican americans living in the u.s. mainland nonetheless are fluent in spanish . puerto ricans are natural-born u.s. citizens , and many puerto ricans have migrated to new york city , orlando , philadelphia , and other areas of the eastern united states , increasing the spanish-speaking populations and in some areas being the majority of the hispanophone population , especially in central florida . in hawaii , where puerto rican farm laborers and mexican ranchers have settled since the late 19th century , 7.0 per cent of the islands ' people are either hispanic or hispanophone or both .
however , the battle was one-sided almost from the beginning . the reasons for this are the subject of continuing study by military strategists and academics . there is general agreement that us technological superiority was a crucial factor but the speed and scale of the iraqi collapse has also been attributed to poor strategic and tactical leadership and low morale among iraqi troops , which resulted from a history of incompetent leadership . after devastating initial strikes against iraqi air defenses and command and control facilities on 17 january 1991 , coalition forces achieved total air superiority almost immediately . the iraqi air force was destroyed within a few days , with some planes fleeing to iran , where they were interned for the duration of the conflict . the overwhelming technological advantages of the us , such as stealth aircraft and infrared sights , quickly turned the air war into a " turkey shoot . " the heat signature of any tank which started its engine made an easy target . air defense radars were quickly destroyed by radar-seeking missiles fired from wild weasel aircraft . grainy video clips , shot from the nose cameras of missiles as they aimed at impossibly small targets , were a staple of us news coverage and revealed to the world a new kind of war , compared by some to a video game . over 6 weeks of relentless pounding by planes and helicopters , the iraqi army was almost completely beaten but did not retreat , under orders from iraqi president saddam hussein , and by the time the ground forces invaded on 24 february , many iraqi troops quickly surrendered to forces much smaller than their own ; in one instance , iraqi forces attempted to surrender to a television camera crew that was advancing with coalition forces .
the monastic communities of the judean desert also decorated their monasteries with mosaic floors . the monastery of martyrius was founded in the end of the 5th century and it was re-discovered in 1982-85 . the most important work of art here is the intact geometric mosaic floor of the refectory although the severely damaged church floor was similarly rich . the mosaics in the church of the nearby monastery of euthymius are of later date ( discovered in 1930 ) . they were laid down in the umayyad era , after a devastating earthquake in 659 . two six pointed stars and a red chalice are the most important surviving features .
the spanish ship san pedro and two other vessels in an expedition commanded by miguel lopez de legazpi discovered an island on january 9 , 1530 , possibly mejit , at 10 ° n , which they named " los barbudos .

shuman built the world 's first solar thermal power station in maadi , egypt , between 1912 and 1913 . shuman 's plant used parabolic troughs to power a 45-52 kilowatts ( 60-70 hp ) engine that pumped more than 22,000 litres ( 4,800 imp gal ; 5,800 us gal ) of water per minute from the nile river to adjacent cotton fields . although the outbreak of world war i and the discovery of cheap oil in the 1930s discouraged the advancement of solar energy , shuman 's vision and basic design were resurrected in the 1970s with a new wave of interest in solar thermal energy . in 1916 shuman was quoted in the media advocating solar energy 's utilization , saying :
while hardware may be a source of insecurity , such as with microchip vulnerabilities maliciously introduced during the manufacturing process , hardware-based or assisted computer security also offers an alternative to software-only computer security . using devices and methods such as dongles , trusted platform modules , intrusion-aware cases , drive locks , disabling usb ports , and mobile-enabled access may be considered more secure due to the physical access ( or sophisticated backdoor access ) required in order to be compromised . each of these is covered in more detail below .
an early formal system of temporal logic was studied by avicenna . although he did not develop a real theory of temporal propositions , he did study the relationship between temporalis and the implication . avicenna 's work was further developed by najm al-din al-qazwini al-katibi and became the dominant system of islamic logic until modern times . avicennian logic also influenced several early european logicians such as albertus magnus and william of ockham . avicenna endorsed the law of noncontradiction proposed by aristotle , that a fact could not be both true and false at the same time and in the same sense of the terminology used . he stated , " anyone who denies the law of noncontradiction should be beaten and burned until he admits that to be beaten is not the same as not to be beaten , and to be burned is not the same as not to be burned . "

the soviet request to join nato arose in the aftermath of the berlin conference of january-february 1954 . soviet foreign minister molotov made proposals to have germany reunified and elections for a pan-german government , under conditions of withdrawal of the four powers armies and german neutrality , but all were refused by the other foreign ministers , dulles ( usa ) , eden ( uk ) and bidault ( france ) . proposals for the reunification of germany were nothing new : earlier on 20 march 1952 , talks about a german reunification , initiated by the socalled ' stalin note ' , ended after the united kingdom , france , and the united states insisted that a unified germany should not be neutral and should be free to join the european defence community and rearm . james dunn ( usa ) , who met in paris with eden , adenauer and robert schuman ( france ) , affirmed that " the object should be to avoid discussion with the russians and to press on the european defense community . " according to john gaddis " there was little inclination in western capitals to explore this offer " from ussr . while historian rolf steininger asserts that adenauer 's conviction that " neutralization means sovietization " was the main factor in the rejection of the soviet proposals , adenauer also feared that unification might have resulted in the end of the cdu 's dominance in the bundestag .
in 1877 , john wanamaker opened the united state 's first modern department store in a former pennsylvania railroad freight terminal in philadelphia . wanamakers was the first department store to offer fixed prices marked on every article and also introduced electrical illumination ( 1878 ) , the telephone ( 1879 ) , and the use of pneumatic tubes to transport cash and documents ( 1880 ) to the department store business . subsequent department stores founded in philadelphia included strawbridge and clothier , gimbels , lit brothers , and snellenbergs .
traditionally , subspecies are seen as geographically isolated and genetically differentiated populations . that is , " the designation ' subspecies ' is used to indicate an objective degree of microevolutionary divergence " one objection to this idea is that it does not specify what degree of differentiation is required . therefore , any population that is somewhat biologically different could be considered a subspecies , even to the level of a local population . as a result , templeton has argued that it is necessary to impose a threshold on the level of difference that is required for a population to be designated a subspecies .
after the preamble comes numbered articles , which contain the substance of the parties ' actual agreement . each article heading usually encompasses a paragraph . a long treaty may further group articles under chapter headings .

while short-term memory encodes information acoustically , long-term memory encodes it semantically : baddeley ( 1966 ) discovered that , after 20 minutes , test subjects had the most difficulty recalling a collection of words that had similar meanings ( e.g. big , large , great , huge ) long-term . another part of long-term memory is episodic memory , " which attempts to capture information such as ' what ' , ' when ' and ' where ' . " with episodic memory , individuals are able to recall specific events such as birthday parties and weddings .
fused quartz is a glass made from chemically-pure sio2 ( silica ) . it has excellent thermal shock characteristics , being able to survive immersion in water while red hot . however , its high melting-temperature ( 1723 ° c ) and viscosity make it difficult to work with . normally , other substances are added to simplify processing . one is sodium carbonate ( na2co3 , " soda " ) , which lowers the glass transition temperature . the soda makes the glass water-soluble , which is usually undesirable , so lime ( calcium oxide [ cao ] , generally obtained from limestone ) , some magnesium oxide ( mgo ) and aluminium oxide ( al2o3 ) are added to provide for a better chemical durability . the resulting glass contains about 70 to 74 % silica by weight and is called a soda-lime glass . soda-lime glasses account for about 90 % of manufactured glass .

in 1931 , rca victor launched the first commercially available vinyl long-playing record , marketed as program-transcription discs . these revolutionary discs were designed for playback at 33 1 ⁄ 3 rpm and pressed on a 30 cm diameter flexible plastic disc , with a duration of about ten minutes playing time per side . rca victor 's early introduction of a long-play disc was a commercial failure for several reasons including the lack of affordable , reliable consumer playback equipment and consumer wariness during the great depression . because of financial hardships that plagued the recording industry during that period ( and rca 's own parched revenues ) , victor 's long-playing records were discontinued by early 1933 .
on the other hand , belgian federalism is federated with three components . an affirmative resolution concerning brussels ' place in the federal system passed in the parliaments of wallonia and brussels . these resolutions passed against the desires of dutch-speaking parties , who are generally in favour of a federal system with two components ( i.e. the dutch and french communities of belgium ) . however , the flemish representatives in the parliament of the brussels capital-region voted in favour of the brussels resolution , with the exception of one party . the chairman of the walloon parliament stated on july 17 , 2008 that , " brussels would take an attitude . " brussels ' parliament passed the resolution on july 18 , 2008 :
through most of shell 's early history , the shell oil company business in the united states was substantially independent with its stock being traded on the nyse and with little direct involvement from the group 's central offices in the running of the american business . however , in 1984 , royal dutch shell made a bid to purchase those shares of shell oil company it did not own ( around 30 % ) and despite opposition from some minority shareholders , which led to a court case , shell completed the buyout for a sum of $ 5.7 billion .
the mexican revolution involved a civil war with hundreds of thousands of deaths and large numbers fleeing combat zones . tens of thousands fled to the u.s. president wilson sent u.s. forces to occupy the mexican city of veracruz for six months in 1914 . it was designed to show the u.s. was keenly interested in the civil war and would not tolerate attacks on americans , especially the april 9 , 1914 , " tampico affair , " which involved the arrest of american sailors by soldiers of the regime of mexican president victoriano huerta . in early 1916 pancho villa a mexican general ordered 500 soldiers on a murderous raid on the american city of columbus new mexico , with the goal of robbing banks to fund his army . the german secret service encouraged pancho villa in his attacks to involve the united states in an intervention in mexico which would distract the united states from its growing involvement in the war and divert aid from europe to support the intervention . wilson called up the state militias ( national guard ) and sent them and the u.s. army under general john j. pershing to punish villa in the pancho villa expedition . villa fled , with the americans in pursuit deep into mexico , thereby arousing mexican nationalism . by early 1917 president venustiano carranza had contained villa and secured the border , so wilson ordered pershing to withdraw .
the four main dialectal forms of old english were mercian , northumbrian , kentish , and west saxon . mercian and northumbrian are together referred to as anglian . in terms of geography the northumbrian region lay north of the humber river ; the mercian lay north of the thames and south of the humber river ; west saxon lay south and southwest of the thames ; and the smallest , kentish region lay southeast of the thames , a small corner of england . the kentish region , settled by the jutes from jutland , has the scantiest literary remains .
the simplest model capacitor consists of two thin parallel conductive plates separated by a dielectric with permittivity ε . this model may also be used to make qualitative predictions for other device geometries . the plates are considered to extend uniformly over an area a and a charge density ± ρ = ± q / a exists on their surface . assuming that the length and width of the plates are much greater than their separation d , the electric field near the centre of the device will be uniform with the magnitude e = ρ / ε . the voltage is defined as the line integral of the electric field between the plates
chinese characters are primarily morphosyllabic , meaning that most chinese morphemes are monosyllabic and are written with a single character , though in modern chinese most words are disyllabic and dimorphemic , consisting of two syllables , each of which is a morpheme . in modern chinese 10 % of morphemes only occur as part of a given compound . however , a few morphemes are disyllabic , some of them dating back to classical chinese . excluding foreign loan words , these are typically words for plants and small animals . they are usually written with a pair of phono-semantic compound characters sharing a common radical . examples are 蝴蝶 hudie " butterfly " and 珊瑚 shanhu " coral . " note that the 蝴 hu of hudie and the 瑚 hu of shanhu have the same phonetic , 胡 , but different radicals ( " insect " and " jade , " respectively ) . neither exists as an independent morpheme except as a poetic abbreviation of the disyllabic word .
with the six consistories , paul vi continued the internationalization policies started by pius xii in 1946 and continued by john xxiii . in his 1976 consistory , five of twenty cardinals originated from africa , one of them a son of a tribal chief with fifty wives . several prominent latin americans like eduardo francisco pironio of argentina ; luis aponte martinez of puerto rico and eugenio de araujo sales and aloisio lorscheider from brazil were also elevated by him . there were voices within the church at the time saying that the european period of the church was coming to a close , a view shared by britain 's cardinal basil hume . at the same time , the members of the college of cardinals lost some of their previous influences , after paul vi decreed , that not only cardinals but also bishops too may participate in committees of the roman curia . the age limit of eighty years imposed by the pope , a numerical increase of cardinals by almost 100 % , and a reform of the regal vestments of the " princes of the church " further contributed to a service-oriented perception of cardinals under his pontificate . the increased number of cardinals from the third world and the papal emphasis on related issues was nevertheless welcomed by many in western europe .
a german trading company , the jaluit gesellschaft , administered the islands from 1887 until 1905 . they conscripted the islanders as laborers and mistreated them . after the german-spanish treaty of 1899 , in which germany acquired the carolines , palau , and the marianas from spain , germany placed all of its micronesian islands , including the marshalls , under the governor of german new guinea .
portugal spearheaded european exploration of the world and the age of discovery . prince henry the navigator , son of king joao i , became the main sponsor and patron of this endeavour . during this period , portugal explored the atlantic ocean , discovering several atlantic archipelagos like the azores , madeira , and cape verde , explored the african coast , colonized selected areas of africa , discovered an eastern route to india via the cape of good hope , discovered brazil , explored the indian ocean , established trading routes throughout most of southern asia , and sent the first direct european maritime trade and diplomatic missions to china and japan .
the willingness to question previously held truths and search for new answers resulted in a period of major scientific advancements , now known as the scientific revolution . the scientific revolution is traditionally held by most historians to have begun in 1543 , when the books de humani corporis fabrica ( on the workings of the human body ) by andreas vesalius , and also de revolutionibus , by the astronomer nicolaus copernicus , were first printed . the thesis of copernicus ' book was that the earth moved around the sun . the period culminated with the publication of the philosophiæ naturalis principia mathematica in 1687 by isaac newton , representative of the unprecedented growth of scientific publications throughout europe .
ziggurats ( sumerian temples ) each had an individual name and consisted of a forecourt , with a central pond for purification . the temple itself had a central nave with aisles along either side . flanking the aisles would be rooms for the priests . at one end would stand the podium and a mudbrick table for animal and vegetable sacrifices . granaries and storehouses were usually located near the temples . after a time the sumerians began to place the temples on top of multi-layered square constructions built as a series of rising terraces , giving rise to the ziggurat style .
studies of autosomal dna , which look at the entire dna mixture , have become increasingly important as the technology develops . they show that jewish populations have tended to form relatively closely related groups in independent communities , with most in a community sharing significant ancestry in common . for jewish populations of the diaspora , the genetic composition of ashkenazi , sephardi , and mizrahi jewish populations show a predominant amount of shared middle eastern ancestry . according to behar , the most parsimonious explanation for this shared middle eastern ancestry is that it is " consistent with the historical formulation of the jewish people as descending from ancient hebrew and israelite residents of the levant " and " the dispersion of the people of ancient israel throughout the old world . " north african , italian and others of iberian origin show variable frequencies of admixture with non-jewish historical host populations among the maternal lines . in the case of ashkenazi and sephardi jews ( in particular moroccan jews ) , who are closely related , the source of non-jewish admixture is mainly southern european , while mizrahi jews show evidence of admixture with other middle eastern populations and sub-saharan africans . behar et al. have remarked on an especially close relationship of ashkenazi jews and modern italians .
ethnocentrism , tribalism , religious persecution , and prebendalism have affected nigerian politics both prior and subsequent to independence in 1960 . kin-selective altruism has made its way into nigerian politics , resulting in tribalist efforts to concentrate federal power to a particular region of their interests . nationalism has also led to active secessionist movements such as massob , nationalist movements such as oodua peoples congress , movement for the emancipation of the niger delta and a civil war . nigeria 's three largest ethnic groups ( hausa , igbo and yoruba ) have maintained historical preeminence in nigerian politics ; competition amongst these three groups has fuelled corruption and graft .
in whitehead 's view , then , concepts such as " quality , " " matter , " and " form " are problematic . these " classical " concepts fail to adequately account for change , and overlook the active and experiential nature of the most basic elements of the world . they are useful abstractions , but are not the world 's basic building blocks . what is ordinarily conceived of as a single person , for instance , is philosophically described as a continuum of overlapping events . after all , people change all the time , if only because they have aged by another second and had some further experience . these occasions of experience are logically distinct , but are progressively connected in what whitehead calls a " society " of events . by assuming that enduring objects are the most real and fundamental things in the universe , materialists have mistaken the abstract for the concrete ( what whitehead calls the " fallacy of misplaced concreteness " ) .
though brazilians of at least partial african heritage make up a large percentage of the population , few blacks have been elected as politicians . the city of salvador , bahia , for instance , is 80 % people of color , but voters have not elected a mayor of color . journalists like to say that us cities with black majorities , such as detroit and new orleans , have not elected white mayors since after the civil rights movement , when the voting rights act of 1965 protected the franchise for minorities , and blacks in the south regained the power to vote for the first time since the turn of the 20th century . new orleans elected its first black mayor in the 1970s . new orleans elected a white mayor after the widescale disruption and damage of hurricane katrina in 2005 .
these representations rely on presenting scenes directly to the eye for their own visible sake . they care for the schematic arrangements of bodies in space , but only as parts in a larger whole . while each scene has its own character and completeness it must fit into the general sequence to which it belongs . in these archaic pediments the sculptors use empty intervals , to suggest a passage to and fro a busy battlefield . the artists seem to have been dominated by geometrical pattern and order , and this was improved when classical art brought a greater freedom and economy .
as a boy , schwarzenegger played several sports , heavily influenced by his father . he picked up his first barbell in 1960 , when his soccer coach took his team to a local gym . at the age of 14 , he chose bodybuilding over soccer as a career . schwarzenegger has responded to a question asking if he was 13 when he started weightlifting : " i actually started weight training when i was 15 , but i 'd been participating in sports , like soccer , for years , so i felt that although i was slim , i was well-developed , at least enough so that i could start going to the gym and start olympic lifting . " however , his official website biography claims : " at 14 , he started an intensive training program with dan farmer , studied psychology at 15 ( to learn more about the power of mind over body ) and at 17 , officially started his competitive career . " during a speech in 2001 , he said , " my own plan formed when i was 14 years old . my father had wanted me to be a police officer like he was . my mother wanted me to go to trade school . " schwarzenegger took to visiting a gym in graz , where he also frequented the local movie theaters to see bodybuilding idols such as reg park , steve reeves , and johnny weissmuller on the big screen . when reeves died in 2000 , schwarzenegger fondly remembered him : " as a teenager , i grew up with steve reeves . his remarkable accomplishments allowed me a sense of what was possible , when others around me didn 't always understand my dreams . steve reeves has been part of everything i 've ever been fortunate enough to achieve . " in 1961 , schwarzenegger met former mr. austria kurt marnul , who invited him to train at the gym in graz . he was so dedicated as a youngster that he broke into the local gym on weekends , when it was usually closed , so that he could train . " it would make me sick to miss a workout ... i knew i couldn 't look at myself in the mirror the next morning if i didn 't do it . " when schwarzenegger was asked about his first movie experience as a boy , he replied : " i was very young , but i remember my father taking me to the austrian theaters and seeing some newsreels . the first real movie i saw , that i distinctly remember , was a john wayne movie . "
on the whole , eisenhower 's support of the nation 's fledgling space program was officially modest until the soviet launch of sputnik in 1957 , gaining the cold war enemy enormous prestige around the world . he then launched a national campaign that funded not just space exploration but a major strengthening of science and higher education . his open skies policy attempted to legitimize illegal lockheed u-2 flyovers and project genetrix while paving the way for spy satellite technology to orbit over sovereign territory , created nasa as a civilian space agency , signed a landmark science education law , and fostered improved relations with american scientists .
the formal structure of the qing government centered on the emperor as the absolute ruler , who presided over six boards ( ministries [ c ] ) , each headed by two presidents [ d ] and assisted by four vice presidents . [ e ] in contrast to the ming system , however , qing ethnic policy dictated that appointments were split between manchu noblemen and han officials who had passed the highest levels of the state examinations . the grand secretariat , [ f ] which had been an important policy-making body under the ming , lost its importance during the qing and evolved into an imperial chancery . the institutions which had been inherited from the ming formed the core of the qing " outer court , " which handled routine matters and was located in the southern part of the forbidden city .
on november 2011 , the sailing boat puma 's mar mostro participant in volvo ocean race arrived to the island after her mast broke in the first leg from alicante and cape town . this event made the island , its inhabitants and lifestyle known worldwide thanks to the media reports .
south korea : the event was held in seoul , which hosted the 1988 summer olympics , on april 27 . intended torchbearers choi seung-kook and park won-sun boycotted the event to protest against the chinese government 's crackdown in tibet . more than 8,000 riot police were deployed to guard the 24-kilometre route , which began at olympic park , which was built when seoul hosted the 1988 summer games . on the day of the torch relay in seoul , chinese students clashed with protesters , throwing rocks , bottles , and punches . a north korean defector whose brother defected to china but was captured and executed by the dprk , attempted to set himself on fire in protest of china 's treatment of north korean refugees . he poured gasoline on himself but police quickly surrounded him and carried him away . two other demonstrators tried to storm the torch but failed . fighting broke out near the beginning of the relay between a group of 500 chinese supporters and approximately 50 protesters who carried a banner that read : " free north korean refugees in china . " the students threw stones and water bottles as approximately 2,500 police tried to keep the groups separated . police said they arrested five people , including a chinese student who was arrested for allegedly throwing rocks . thousands of chinese followed the torch on its 4.5 hour journey , some chanting , " go china , go olympics ! " by the end of the relay , chinese students became violent , and it was reported in korean media that they were " lynching " everyone who was disagreeing with them . one police man was also rushed to hospital after being attacked by chinese students . on apr 29 , the secretary of justice , kim kyung han , told the prime minister that he will find " every single chinese who was involved and bring them to justice . " later in the day , south korea 's prosecutor 's office , national police agency , ministry of foreign affairs and national intelligence service made a joint statement saying that they will be deporting every chinese student that was involved in the incident . china defended the conduct of the students .
for african americans , the one-drop rule was a significant factor in ethnic solidarity . african americans generally shared a common cause in society regardless of their multiracial admixture , or social / economic stratification . additionally , african americans found it , near , impossible to learn about their indigenous american heritage as many family elders withheld pertinent genealogical information . tracing the genealogy of african americans can be a very difficult process , especially for descendants of indigenous americans , because african americans who were slaves were forbidden to learn to read and write , and a majority of indigenous americans neither spoke english , nor read or wrote it .
although the structural model provided by the university of paris , where student members are controlled by faculty " masters , " provided a standard for universities , the application of this model took at least three different forms . there were universities that had a system of faculties whose teaching addressed a very specific curriculum ; this model tended to train specialists . there was a collegiate or tutorial model based on the system at university of oxford where teaching and organization was decentralized and knowledge was more of a generalist nature . there were also universities that combined these models , using the collegiate model but having a centralized organization .
hayek 's principal investigations in economics concerned capital , money , and the business cycle . mises had earlier applied the concept of marginal utility to the value of money in his theory of money and credit ( 1912 ) , in which he also proposed an explanation for " industrial fluctuations " based on the ideas of the old british currency school and of swedish economist knut wicksell . hayek used this body of work as a starting point for his own interpretation of the business cycle , elaborating what later became known as the " austrian theory of the business cycle . " hayek spelled out the austrian approach in more detail in his book , published in 1929 , an english translation of which appeared in 1933 as monetary theory and the trade cycle . there he argued for a monetary approach to the origins of the cycle . in his prices and production ( 1931 ) , hayek argued that the business cycle resulted from the central bank 's inflationary credit expansion and its transmission over time , leading to a capital misallocation caused by the artificially low interest rates . hayek claimed that " the past instability of the market economy is the consequence of the exclusion of the most important regulator of the market mechanism , money , from itself being regulated by the market process . "
years later , kaunitz kept trying to establish france 's alliance with austria . he tried as hard as he could for austria to not get entangled in hanover 's political affairs , and was even willing to trade austrian netherlands for france 's aid in recapturing silesia . frustrated by this decision and by the dutch republic 's insistence on neutrality , britain soon turned to russia . on september 30 , 1755 , britain pledged financial aid to russia in order to station 50,000 troops on the livonian-lithunian border , so they could defend britain 's interests in hanover immediately . besthuzev , assuming the preparation was directed against prussia , was more than happy to obey the request of the british . unbeknownst to the other powers , king george ii also made overtures to the prussian king ; frederick , who began fearing the austro-russian intentions , and was excited to welcome a rapprochement with britain . on january 16 , 1756 , the convention of westminster was signed wherein britain and prussia promised to aid one another in order to achieve lasting peace and stability in europe .
laserdisc did not have high market penetration in north america due to the high cost of the players and discs , which were far more expensive than vhs players and tapes , and due to marketplace confusion with the technologically inferior ced , which also went by the name videodisc . while the format was not widely adopted by north american consumers , it was well received among videophiles due to the superior audio and video quality compared to vhs and betamax tapes , finding a place in nearly one million american homes by the end of 1990 . the format was more popular in japan than in north america because prices were kept low to ensure adoption , resulting in minimal price differences between vhs tapes and the higher quality laserdiscs , helping ensure that it quickly became the dominant consumer video format in japan . anime collectors in every country the ld format was released , which includes both north america and japan , also quickly became familiar with this format , and sought the higher video and sound quality of laserdisc and the availability of numerous titles not available on vhs . laserdiscs were also popular alternatives to videocassettes among movie enthusiasts in the more affluent regions of south east asia , such as singapore , due to their high integration with the japanese export market and the disc-based media 's superior longevity compared to videocassette , especially in the humid conditions endemic to that area of the world .
the government broadened land ownership by returning land that had been sold to large landowners in the late ming period by families unable to pay the land tax . to give people more incentives to participate in the market , they reduced the tax burden in comparison with the late ming , and replaced the corvee system with a head tax used to hire laborers . the administration of the grand canal was made more efficient , and transport opened to private merchants . a system of monitoring grain prices eliminated severe shortages , and enabled the price of rice to rise slowly and smoothly through the 18th century . wary of the power of wealthy merchants , qing rulers limited their trading licenses and usually refused them permission to open new mines , except in poor areas . these restrictions on domestic resource exploration , as well as on foreign trade , are held by some scholars as a cause of the great divergence , by which the western world overtook china economically .
the most excellent order of the british empire is the " order of chivalry of british constitutional monarchy , " rewarding contributions to the arts and sciences , work with charitable and welfare organisations and public service outside the civil service . it was established on 4 june 1917 by king george v , and comprises five classes , in civil and military divisions , the most senior two of which make the recipient either a knight if male , or dame if female . there is also the related british empire medal , whose recipients are affiliated with , but not members of , the order .
originally , legislative power was exercised by the sovereign acting on the advice of the curia regis , or royal council , in which important magnates and clerics participated and which evolved into parliament . the so-called model parliament included bishops , abbots , earls , barons , and two knights from each shire and two burgesses from each borough among its members . in 1265 , the earl of leicester irregularly called a full parliament without royal authorisation . the body eventually came to be divided into two branches : bishops , abbots , earls , and barons formed the house of lords , while the shire and borough representatives formed the house of commons . the king would seek the advice and consent of both houses before making any law . during henry vi 's reign , it became regular practice for the two houses to originate legislation in the form of bills , which would not become law unless the sovereign 's assent was obtained , as the sovereign was , and still remains , the enactor of laws . hence , all acts include the clause " be it enacted by the queen 's ( king 's ) most excellent majesty , by and with the advice and consent of the lords spiritual and temporal , and commons , in this present parliament assembled , and by the authority of the same , as follows .... " the parliament acts 1911 and 1949 provide a second potential preamble if the house of lords were to be excluded from the process .
the method of self-exertion or " self-power " - without reliance on an external force or being - stands in contrast to another major form of buddhism , pure land , which is characterized by utmost trust in the salvific " other-power " of amitabha buddha . pure land buddhism is a very widespread and perhaps the most faith-orientated manifestation of buddhism and centres upon the conviction that faith in amitabha buddha and the chanting of homage to his name liberates one at death into the blissful ( 安樂 ) , pure land ( 淨土 ) of amitabha buddha . this buddhic realm is variously construed as a foretaste of nirvana , or as essentially nirvana itself . the great vow of amitabha buddha to rescue all beings from samsaric suffering is viewed within pure land buddhism as universally efficacious , if only one has faith in the power of that vow or chants his name .
early on , american courts , even after the revolution , often did cite contemporary english cases . this was because appellate decisions from many american courts were not regularly reported until the mid-19th century ; lawyers and judges , as creatures of habit , used english legal materials to fill the gap . but citations to english decisions gradually disappeared during the 19th century as american courts developed their own principles to resolve the legal problems of the american people . the number of published volumes of american reports soared from eighteen in 1810 to over 8,000 by 1910 . by 1879 one of the delegates to the california constitutional convention was already complaining : " now , when we require them to state the reasons for a decision , we do not mean they shall write a hundred pages of detail . we [ do ] not mean that they shall include the small cases , and impose on the country all this fine judicial literature , for the lord knows we have got enough of that already . "
a generation later , the irish anglican bishop , george berkeley ( 1685-1753 ) , determined that locke 's view immediately opened a door that would lead to eventual atheism . in response to locke , he put forth in his treatise concerning the principles of human knowledge ( 1710 ) an important challenge to empiricism in which things only exist either as a result of their being perceived , or by virtue of the fact that they are an entity doing the perceiving . ( for berkeley , god fills in for humans by doing the perceiving whenever humans are not around to do it . ) in his text alciphron , berkeley maintained that any order humans may see in nature is the language or handwriting of god . berkeley 's approach to empiricism would later come to be called subjective idealism .
a number of medications are being studied for multi drug resistant tuberculosis including : bedaquiline and delamanid . bedaquiline received u.s. food and drug administration ( fda ) approval in late 2012 . the safety and effectiveness of these new agents are still uncertain , because they are based on the results of a relatively small studies . however , existing data suggest that patients taking bedaquiline in addition to standard tb therapy are five times more likely to die than those without the new drug , which has resulted in medical journal articles raising health policy questions about why the fda approved the drug and whether financial ties to the company making bedaquiline influenced physicians ' support for its use
the statistics portugal ( portuguese : ine - instituto nacional de estatistica ) estimates that , according to the 2011 census , the population was 10,562,178 ( of which 52 % was female , 48 % was male ) . this population has been relatively homogeneous for most of its history : a single religion ( catholicism ) and a single language have contributed to this ethnic and national unity , namely after the expulsion of the moors and jews . a considerable number of moors and jews , nevertheless , stayed in portugal , under the condition that they converted to catholicism , and afterwards they were known as mouriscos ( former muslims ) and cristaos novos ( new christians or former jews ) some of whom may have continued to observe rabbinic judaism in secret , as in the case of the secret jews of belmonte , who now observe the jewish faith openly . after 1772 the distinction between old and new christians was abolished by decree . some famous portuguese new christians were the mathematician pedro nunes and the physician and naturalist garcia de orta .
among the notable structures in the town are the three forts built by the swedes for defense purposes . one of these forts , known as fort oscar ( formerly gustav adolph ) , which overlooks the sea is located on the far side of la pointe . however , the ruins have been replaced by a modern military building which now houses the local gendarmerie . the other fort known as fort karl now presents a very few ruins . the third fort built by the swedes is the fort gustav , which is also seen in ruins strewn around the weather station and the light house . the fort built in 1787 over a hill slope has ruins of ramparts , guardhouse , munitions depot , wood-burning oven and so forth .
though still predominantly green , post-2004 series incorporate other colors to better distinguish different denominations . as a result of a 2008 decision in an accessibility lawsuit filed by the american council of the blind , the bureau of engraving and printing is planning to implement a raised tactile feature in the next redesign of each note , except the $ 1 and the version of the $ 100 bill already in process . it also plans larger , higher-contrast numerals , more color differences , and distribution of currency readers to assist the visually impaired during the transition period .
the last opus number that chopin himself used was 65 , allocated to the cello sonata in g minor . he expressed a deathbed wish that all his unpublished manuscripts be destroyed . at the request of the composer 's mother and sisters , however , his musical executor julian fontana selected 23 unpublished piano pieces and grouped them into eight further opus numbers ( opp . 66-73 ) , published in 1855 . in 1857 , 17 polish songs that chopin wrote at various stages of his life were collected and published as op. 74 , though their order within the opus did not reflect the order of composition .
the cuisine of switzerland is multifaceted . while some dishes such as fondue , raclette or rosti are omnipresent through the country , each region developed its own gastronomy according to the differences of climate and languages . traditional swiss cuisine uses ingredients similar to those in other european countries , as well as unique dairy products and cheeses such as gruyere or emmental , produced in the valleys of gruyeres and emmental . the number of fine-dining establishments is high , particularly in western switzerland .
since 2005 , iran 's nuclear program has become the subject of contention with the international community following earlier quotes of iranian leadership favoring the use of an atomic bomb against iran 's enemies and in particular israel . many countries have expressed concern that iran 's nuclear program could divert civilian nuclear technology into a weapons program . this has led the un security council to impose sanctions against iran which had further isolated iran politically and economically from the rest of the global community . in 2009 , the us director of national intelligence said that iran , if choosing to , would not be able to develop a nuclear weapon until 2013 .
china also began suffering from mounting overpopulation during this period . population growth was stagnant for the first half of the 17th century due to civil wars and epidemics , but prosperity and internal stability gradually reversed this trend . the introduction of new crops from the americas such as the potato and peanut allowed an improved food supply as well , so that the total population of china during the 18th century ballooned from 100 million to 300 million people . soon all available farmland was used up , forcing peasants to work ever-smaller and more intensely worked plots . the qianlong emperor once bemoaned the country 's situation by remarking " the population continues to grow , but the land does not . " the only remaining part of the empire that had arable farmland was manchuria , where the provinces of jilin and heilongjiang had been walled off as a manchu homeland . the emperor decreed for the first time that han chinese civilians were forbidden to settle . mongols were forbidden by the qing from crossing the borders of their banners , even into other mongol banners and from crossing into neidi ( the han chinese 18 provinces ) and were given serious punishments if they did in order to keep the mongols divided against each other to benefit the qing .
prior to confederation in 1867 , residents of the colonies in what is now canada served as regular members of french and british forces and in local militia groups . the latter aided in the defence of their respective territories against attacks by other european powers , aboriginal peoples , and later american forces during the american revolutionary war and war of 1812 , as well as in the fenian raids , red river rebellion , and north-west rebellion . consequently , the lineages of some canadian army units stretch back to the early 19th century , when militia units were formed to assist in the defence of british north america against invasion by the united states .
according to thomas degregori , an economics professor at the university of houston , in an article published by the cato institute , a libertarian think-tank operating in washington d.c. , " it is clear that technological and economic change are vital ingredients in getting children out of the workplace and into schools . then they can grow to become productive adults and live longer , healthier lives . however , in poor countries like bangladesh , working children are essential for survival in many families , as they were in our own heritage until the late 19th century . so , while the struggle to end child labour is necessary , getting there often requires taking different routes - and , sadly , there are many political obstacles .
morales began work on his " indigenous autonomy " policy , which he launched in the eastern lowlands department on august 3 , 2009 , making bolivia the first country in the history of south america to affirm the right of indigenous people to govern themselves . speaking in santa cruz department , the president called it " a historic day for the peasant and indigenous movement , " saying that , though he might make errors , he would " never betray the fight started by our ancestors and the fight of the bolivian people . " a vote on further autonomy will take place in referendums which are expected to be held in december 2009 . the issue has divided the country .
executive authority in saint helena is vested in queen elizabeth ii and is exercised on her behalf by the governor of saint helena . the governor is appointed by the queen on the advice of the british government . defence and foreign affairs remain the responsibility of the united kingdom .
at the 29 august arab league summit in khartoum , nasser 's usual commanding position had receded as the attending heads of state expected saudi king faisal to lead . a ceasefire in the yemen war was declared and the summit concluded with the khartoum resolution . the soviet union soon resupplied the egyptian military with about half of its former arsenals and broke diplomatic relations with israel . nasser cut relations with the us following the war , and , according to aburish , his policy of " playing the superpowers against each other " ended . in november , nasser accepted un resolution 242 , which called for israel 's withdrawal from territories acquired in the war . his supporters claimed nasser 's move was meant to buy time to prepare for another confrontation with israel , while his detractors believed his acceptance of the resolution signaled a waning interest in palestinian independence .
neptune is the eighth and farthest known planet from the sun in the solar system . it is the fourth-largest planet by diameter and the third-largest by mass . among the giant planets in the solar system , neptune is the most dense . neptune is 17 times the mass of earth and is slightly more massive than its near-twin uranus , which is 15 times the mass of earth and slightly larger than neptune . [ c ] neptune orbits the sun once every 164.8 years at an average distance of 30.1 astronomical units ( 4.50 × 109 km ) . named after the roman god of the sea , its astronomical symbol is ♆ , a stylised version of the god neptune 's trident .
during the nimrod expedition led by ernest shackleton in 1907 , parties led by edgeworth david became the first to climb mount erebus and to reach the south magnetic pole . douglas mawson , who assumed the leadership of the magnetic pole party on their perilous return , went on to lead several expeditions until retiring in 1931 . in addition , shackleton himself and three other members of his expedition made several firsts in december 1908 - february 1909 : they were the first humans to traverse the ross ice shelf , the first to traverse the transantarctic mountains ( via the beardmore glacier ) , and the first to set foot on the south polar plateau . an expedition led by norwegian polar explorer roald amundsen from the ship fram became the first to reach the geographic south pole on 14 december 1911 , using a route from the bay of whales and up the axel heiberg glacier . one month later , the doomed scott expedition reached the pole .
the city 's elevation is 2,643 ft ( 806 m ) above sea level ( as measured at the tucson international airport ) . tucson is situated on an alluvial plain in the sonoran desert , surrounded by five minor ranges of mountains : the santa catalina mountains and the tortolita mountains to the north , the santa rita mountains to the south , the rincon mountains to the east , and the tucson mountains to the west . the high point of the santa catalina mountains is 9,157 ft ( 2,791 m ) mount lemmon , the southernmost ski destination in the continental u.s. , while the tucson mountains include 4,687 ft ( 1,429 m ) wasson peak . the highest point in the area is mount wrightson , found in the santa rita mountains at 9,453 ft ( 2,881 m ) above sea level .
the same considerations about barriers and detours that apply to long-distance land-bird migration apply to water birds , but in reverse : a large area of land without bodies of water that offer feeding sites may also be a barrier to a bird that feeds in coastal waters . detours avoiding such barriers are observed : for example , brent geese branta bernicla migrating from the taymyr peninsula to the wadden sea travel via the white sea coast and the baltic sea rather than directly across the arctic ocean and northern scandinavia .
in early times , the privilege of papal election was not reserved to the cardinals , and for centuries the person elected was customarily a roman priest and never a bishop from elsewhere . to preserve apostolic succession the rite of consecrating him a bishop had to be performed by someone who was already a bishop . the rule remains that , if the person elected pope is not yet a bishop , he is consecrated by the dean of the college of cardinals , the cardinal bishop of ostia .
in the 2010s , american jurisdictions have experienced a shortage of lethal injection drugs , due to anti-death penalty advocacy and low production volume . hospira , the only u.s. manufacturer of sodium thiopental , stopped making the drug in 2011 . the european union has outlawed the export of any product that could be used in an execution ; this has prevented executioners from using eu-manufactured anesthetics like propofol which are needed for general medical purposes . another alternative , pentobarbital , is also only manufactured in the european union , which has caused the danish producer to restrict distribution to u.s. government customers .
the standard playstation 3 version of the xrossmediabar ( pronounced cross media bar , or abbreviated xmb ) includes nine categories of options . these are : users , settings , photo , music , video , tv / video services , game , network , playstation network and friends ( similar to the playstation portable media bar ) . thetv / video services category is for services like netflix and / or if playtv or torne is installed ; the first category in this section is " my channels , " which lets users download various streaming services , including sony 's own streaming services crackle and playstation vue . by default , the what 's new section of playstation network is displayed when the system starts up . ps3 includes the ability to store various master and secondary user profiles , manage and explore photos with or without a musical slide show , play music and copy audio cd tracks to an attached data storage device , play movies and video files from the hard disk drive , an optical disc ( blu-ray disc or dvd-video ) or an optional usb mass storage or flash card , compatibility for a usb keyboard and mouse and a web browser supporting compatible-file download function . additionally , upnp media will appear in the respective audio / video / photo categories if a compatible media server or dlna server is detected on the local network . the friends menu allows mail with emoticon and attached picture features and video chat which requires an optional playstation eye or eyetoy webcam . the network menu allows online shopping through the playstation store and connectivity to playstation portable via remote play .
the crisis deepened during the 17th century with the expulsion in 1609 of the jews and the moriscos , descendants of the muslim population that converted to christianity under threat of exile from ferdinand and isabella in 1502 . from 1609 through 1614 , the spanish government systematically forced moriscos to leave the kingdom for muslim north africa . they were concentrated in the former kingdom of aragon , where they constituted a fifth of the population , and the valencia area specifically , where they were roughly a third of the total population . the expulsion caused the financial ruin of some of the nobility and the bankruptcy of the taula de canvi in 1613 . the crown endeavoured to compensate the nobles , who had lost much of their agricultural labour force ; this harmed the economy of the city for generations to come . later , during the so-called catalan revolt ( 1640-1652 ) , valencia contributed to the cause of philip iv with militias and money , resulting in a period of further economic hardship exacerbated by the arrival of troops from other parts of spain .
the problem of the flow of time , as it has been treated in analytic philosophy , owes its beginning to a paper written by j. m. e. mctaggart . in this paper mctaggart proposes two " temporal series . " the first series , which means to account for our intuitions about temporal becoming , or the moving now , is called the a-series . the a-series orders events according to their being in the past , present or future , simpliciter and in comparison to each other . the b-series eliminates all reference to the present , and the associated temporal modalities of past and future , and orders all events by the temporal relations earlier than and later than .
the coalition government led the country to the parliamentary elections of may 2012 . the power of the traditional greek political parties , pasok and new democracy , declined from 43 % to 13 % and from 33 % to 18 % , respectively , due to their support on the politics of mnimonio and the austerity measures . the leftist party of syriza became the second major party , with an increase from 4 % to 16 % . no party could form a sustainable government , which led to the parliamentary elections of june 2012 . the result of the second elections was the formation of a coalition government composed of new democracy ( 29 % ) , pasok ( 12 % ) and democratic left ( 6 % ) parties .
most annelids have a pair of coelomata ( body cavities ) in each segment , separated from other segments by septa and from each other by vertical mesenteries . each septum forms a sandwich with connective tissue in the middle and mesothelium ( membrane that serves as a lining ) from the preceding and following segments on either side . each mesentery is similar except that the mesothelium is the lining of each of the pair of coelomata , and the blood vessels and , in polychaetes , the main nerve cords are embedded in it . the mesothelium is made of modified epitheliomuscular cells ; in other words , their bodies form part of the epithelium but their bases extend to form muscle fibers in the body wall . the mesothelium may also form radial and circular muscles on the septa , and circular muscles around the blood vessels and gut . parts of the mesothelium , especially on the outside of the gut , may also form chloragogen cells that perform similar functions to the livers of vertebrates : producing and storing glycogen and fat ; producing the oxygen-carrier hemoglobin ; breaking down proteins ; and turning nitrogenous waste products into ammonia and urea to be excreted .
most portuguese and mesticos speak one of the african languages and kriol as second languages . french is also taught in schools because guinea-bissau is surrounded by french-speaking nations . guinea-bissau is a full member of the francophonie .
in 1913 , elmer mccollum discovered the first vitamins , fat-soluble vitamin a , and water-soluble vitamin b ( in 1915 ; now known to be a complex of several water-soluble vitamins ) and named vitamin c as the then-unknown substance preventing scurvy . lafayette mendel and thomas osborne also performed pioneering work on vitamins a and b. in 1919 , sir edward mellanby incorrectly identified rickets as a vitamin a deficiency because he could cure it in dogs with cod liver oil . in 1922 , mccollum destroyed the vitamin a in cod liver oil , but found that it still cured rickets . also in 1922 , h.m. evans and l.s. bishop discover vitamin e as essential for rat pregnancy , originally calling it " food factor x " until 1925 .
some street trams ( streetcars ) used conduit third-rail current collection . the third rail was below street level . the tram picked up the current through a plough ( u.s. " plow " ) accessed through a narrow slot in the road . in the united states , much ( though not all ) of the former streetcar system in washington , d.c. ( discontinued in 1962 ) was operated in this manner to avoid the unsightly wires and poles associated with electric traction . the same was true with manhattan 's former streetcar system . the evidence of this mode of running can still be seen on the track down the slope on the northern access to the abandoned kingsway tramway subway in central london , united kingdom , where the slot between the running rails is clearly visible , and on p and q streets west of wisconsin avenue in the georgetown neighborhood of washington dc , where the abandoned tracks have not been paved over . the slot can easily be confused with the similar looking slot for cable trams / cars ( in some cases , the conduit slot was originally a cable slot ) . the disadvantage of conduit collection included much higher initial installation costs , higher maintenance costs , and problems with leaves and snow getting in the slot . for this reason , in washington , d.c. cars on some lines converted to overhead wire on leaving the city center , a worker in a " plough pit " disconnecting the plough while another raised the trolley pole ( hitherto hooked down to the roof ) to the overhead wire . in new york city for the same reasons of cost and operating efficiency outside of manhattan overhead wire was used . a similar system of changeover from conduit to overhead wire was also used on the london tramways , notably on the southern side ; a typical changeover point was at norwood , where the conduit snaked sideways from between the running rails , to provide a park for detached shoes or ploughs .
there are dozens of other chemical neurotransmitters that are used in more limited areas of the brain , often areas dedicated to a particular function . serotonin , for example - the primary target of antidepressant drugs and many dietary aids - comes exclusively from a small brainstem area called the raphe nuclei . norepinephrine , which is involved in arousal , comes exclusively from a nearby small area called the locus coeruleus . other neurotransmitters such as acetylcholine and dopamine have multiple sources in the brain , but are not as ubiquitously distributed as glutamate and gaba .
the attacks were focused against western ports in march . these attacks produced some breaks in morale , with civil leaders fleeing the cities before the offensive reached its height . but the luftwaffe 's effort eased in the last 10 attacks as seven kampfgruppen moved to austria in preparation for the balkans campaign in yugoslavia and greece . the shortage of bombers caused the okl to improvise . some 50 junkers ju 87 stuka dive-bombers and jabos ( fighter-bombers ) were used , officially classed as leichte kampfflugzeuge ( " light bombers " ) and sometimes called leichte kesselringe ( " light kesselrings " ) . the defences failed to prevent widespread damage but on some occasions did prevent german bombers concentrating on their targets . on occasion , only one-third of german bombs hit their targets .
the most well-known hospital in the hhc system is bellevue hospital , the oldest public hospital in the united states . bellevue is the designated hospital for treatment of the president of the united states and other world leaders if they become sick or injured while in new york city . the president of hhc is ramanathan raju , md , a surgeon and former ceo of the cook county health system in illinois .
following the ' 69 season , the club posted winning records for the next few seasons , but no playoff action . after the core players of those teams started to move on , the 70s got worse for the team , and they became known as " the loveable losers . " in 1977 , the team found some life , but ultimately experienced one of its biggest collapses . the cubs hit a high-water mark on june 28 at 47-22 , boasting an 8 1 ⁄ 2 game nl east lead , as they were led by bobby murcer ( 27 hr / 89 rbi ) , and rick reuschel ( 20-10 ) . however , the philadelphia phillies cut the lead to two by the all-star break , as the cubs sat 19 games over .500 , but they swooned late in the season , going 20-40 after july 31 . the cubs finished in 4th place at 81-81 , while philadelphia surged , finishing with 101 wins . the following two seasons also saw the cubs get off to a fast start , as the team rallied to over 10 games above .500 well into both seasons , only to again wear down and play poorly later on , and ultimately settling back to mediocrity . this trait became known as the " june swoon . " again , the cubs ' unusually high number of day games is often pointed to as one reason for the team 's inconsistent late season play .
as of 2009 , dial up , wireless and satellite services were available . dial up internet services in somalia were among the fastest growing on the continent , with an annual landline growth rate of over 12.5 % . the increase in usage was largely due to innovative policy initiatives adopted by the various somali telecom operators , including free local in-town calls , a flat rate of $ 10 per month for unlimited calls , a low charge of $ 0.005 per minute for internet connections , and a one-time connection fee of $ 50 . global internet company , a firm jointly owned by the major somali telecommunication networks hormuud telecom , telcom somalia and nationlink , was the country 's largest isp . it was at the time the only provider of dial up services in somalia 's south-central regions . in the northern puntland and somaliland regions , online networks offered internet dial up services to their own group of subscribers . among these firms was golis telecom somalia in the northeast and telesom in the northwest .
at the foundation of the order , the " medal of the order of the british empire " was instituted , to serve as a lower award granting recipients affiliation but not membership . in 1922 , this was renamed the " british empire medal . " it stopped being awarded by the united kingdom as part of the 1993 reforms to the honours system , but was again awarded beginning in 2012 , starting with 293 bems awarded for the queen 's diamond jubilee . in addition , the bem is awarded by the cook islands and by some other commonwealth nations . in 2004 , a report entitled " a matter of honour : reforming our honours system " by a commons committee recommended to phase out the order of the british empire , as its title was " now considered to be unacceptable , being thought to embody values that are no longer shared by many of the country 's population . "
owing to economic conditions and the late 2000s recession , many of the proposed mega casinos never went further than the initial planning stages . one of these developers was pinnacle entertainment , who purchased the sands atlantic city , only to close it permanently november 11 , 2006 . the following year , the resort was demolished in a dramatic , las vegas styled implosion , the first of its kind in atlantic city . while pinnacle entertainment intended to replace it with a $ 1.5-2 billion casino resort , the company canceled its construction plans and plans to sell the land . the biggest disappointment was when mgm resorts international announced that it would pull out of all development for atlantic city , effectively ending their plans for the mgm grand atlantic city .
american idol is broadcast to over 100 nations outside of the united states . in most nations these are not live broadcasts and may be tape delayed by several days or weeks . in canada , the first thirteen seasons of american idol were aired live by ctv and / or ctv two , in simulcast with fox . ctv dropped idol after its thirteenth season and in august 2014 , yes tv announced that it had picked up canadian rights to american idol beginning in its 2015 season .
some predators take advantage of the concentration of birds during migration . greater noctule bats feed on nocturnal migrating passerines . some birds of prey specialize on migrating waders .
the jat-reflex rules are not without exception . for example , when short jat is preceded by r , in most ijekavian dialects developed into / re / or , occasionally , / ri / . the prefix pre- ( " trans- , over- " ) when long became pre- in eastern ijekavian dialects but to prije- in western dialects ; in ikavian pronunciation , it also evolved into pre- or prije- due to potential ambiguity with pri- ( " approach , come close to " ) . for verbs that had -eti in their infinitive , the past participle ending -el evolved into -io in ijekavian neostokavian .
a standard dialect ( also known as a standardized dialect or " standard language " ) is a dialect that is supported by institutions . such institutional support may include government recognition or designation ; presentation as being the " correct " form of a language in schools ; published grammars , dictionaries , and textbooks that set forth a correct spoken and written form ; and an extensive formal literature that employs that dialect ( prose , poetry , non-fiction , etc . ) . there may be multiple standard dialects associated with a single language . for example , standard american english , standard british english , standard canadian english , standard indian english , standard australian english , and standard philippine english may all be said to be standard dialects of the english language .
a science hall was built in 1883 under the direction of fr . zahm , but in 1950 it was converted to a student union building and named lafortune center , after joseph lafortune , an oil executive from tulsa , oklahoma . commonly known as " lafortune " or " lafun , " it is a 4-story building of 83,000 square feet that provides the notre dame community with a meeting place for social , recreational , cultural , and educational activities . lafortune employs 35 part-time student staff and 29 full-time non-student staff and has an annual budget of $ 1.2 million . many businesses , services , and divisions of the office of student affairs are found within . the building also houses restaurants from national restaurant chains .
on december 25 , 1991 , following the collapse of the soviet union , the republic was renamed the russian federation , which it remains to this day . this name and " russia " were specified as the official state names in the april 21 , 1992 amendment to the existing constitution and were retained as such in the 1993 constitution of russia .
things were looking grim for prussia now , with the austrians mobilising to attack prussian-controlled soil and a french army under soubise approaching from the west . however , in november and december of 1757 , the whole situation in germany was reversed . first , frederick devastated prince soubise 's french force at the battle of rossbach on 5 november 1757 and then routed a vastly superior austrian force at the battle of leuthen on 5 december 1757 with these victories , frederick once again established himself as europe 's premier general and his men as europe 's most accomplished soldiers . in spite of this , the prussians were now facing the prospect of four major powers attacking on four fronts ( france from the west , austria from the south , russia from the east and sweden from the north ) . meanwhile , a combined force from a number of smaller german states such as bavaria had been established under austrian leadership , thus threatening prussian control of saxony .
the nawab of bengal siraj ud daulah , the de facto ruler of the bengal province , opposed british attempts to use these permits . this led to the battle of plassey on 23 june 1757 , in which the bengal army of the east india company , led by robert clive , defeated the french-supported nawab 's forces . this was the first real political foothold with territorial implications that the british acquired in india . clive was appointed by the company as its first ' governor of bengal ' in 1757 . this was combined with british victories over the french at madras , wandiwash and pondichery that , along with wider british successes during the seven years ' war , reduced french influence in india . the british east india company extended its control over the whole of bengal . after the battle of buxar in 1764 , the company acquired the rights of administration in bengal from de jure mughal emperor shah alam ii ; this marked the beginning of its formal rule , which within the next century engulfed most of india . the east india company monopolized the trade of bengal . they introduced a land taxation system called the permanent settlement which introduced a feudal-like structure in bengal , often with zamindars set in place .
although it had equipment capable of doing serious damage , the problem for the luftwaffe was its unclear strategy and poor intelligence . okl had not been informed that britain was to be considered a potential opponent until early 1938 . it had no time to gather reliable intelligence on britain 's industries . moreover , okl could not settle on an appropriate strategy . german planners had to decide whether the luftwaffe should deliver the weight of its attacks against a specific segment of british industry such as aircraft factories , or against a system of interrelated industries such as britain 's import and distribution network , or even in a blow aimed at breaking the morale of the british population . the luftwaffe 's strategy became increasingly aimless over the winter of 1940-1941 . disputes among the okl staff revolved more around tactics than strategy . this method condemned the offensive over britain to failure before it began .
on the basis of the expansion and development of yerevan state university a number of higher educational independent institutions were formed including medical institute separated in 1930 which was set up on the basis of medical faculty . in 1980 yerevan state medical university was awarded one of the main rewards of the former ussr - the order of labor red banner for training qualified specialists in health care and valuable service in the development of medical science . in 1995 ysmi was renamed to ysmu and since 1989 it has been named after mkhitar heratsi , the famous medieval doctor . mkhitar heratsi was the founder of armenian medical school in cilician armenia . the great doctor played the same role in armenian medical science as hippocrates in western , galen in roman , ibn sina in arabic medicine .
most former british colonies and protectorates are among the 53 member states of the commonwealth of nations , a non-political , voluntary association of equal members , comprising a population of around 2.2 billion people . sixteen commonwealth realms voluntarily continue to share the british monarch , queen elizabeth ii , as their head of state . these sixteen nations are distinct and equal legal entities - the united kingdom , australia , canada , new zealand , papua new guinea , antigua and barbuda , the bahamas , barbados , belize , grenada , jamaica , saint kitts and nevis , saint lucia , saint vincent and the grenadines , solomon islands and tuvalu .
as sound scholar jonathan sterne notes , " an australian hacker acquired l3enc using a stolen credit card . the hacker then reverse-engineered the software , wrote a new user interface , and redistributed it for free , naming it " thank you fraunhofer " . "

in humans and many other mammals , new neurons are created mainly before birth , and the infant brain contains substantially more neurons than the adult brain . there are , however , a few areas where new neurons continue to be generated throughout life . the two areas for which adult neurogenesis is well established are the olfactory bulb , which is involved in the sense of smell , and the dentate gyrus of the hippocampus , where there is evidence that the new neurons play a role in storing newly acquired memories . with these exceptions , however , the set of neurons that is present in early childhood is the set that is present for life . glial cells are different : as with most types of cells in the body , they are generated throughout the lifespan .
in a 1964 interview , lee remarked that her aspiration was " to be ... the jane austen of south alabama . " both austen and lee challenged the social status quo and valued individual worth over social standing . when scout embarrasses her poorer classmate , walter cunningham , at the finch home one day , calpurnia , their black cook , chastises and punishes her for doing so . atticus respects calpurnia 's judgment , and later in the book even stands up to his sister , the formidable aunt alexandra , when she strongly suggests they fire calpurnia . one writer notes that scout , " in austenian fashion , " satirizes women with whom she does not wish to identify . literary critic jean blackall lists the priorities shared by the two authors : " affirmation of order in society , obedience , courtesy , and respect for the individual without regard for status . "
changes in secondary sex characteristics include every change that is not directly related to sexual reproduction . in males , these changes involve appearance of pubic , facial , and body hair , deepening of the voice , roughening of the skin around the upper arms and thighs , and increased development of the sweat glands . in females , secondary sex changes involve elevation of the breasts , widening of the hips , development of pubic and underarm hair , widening of the areolae , and elevation of the nipples . the changes in secondary sex characteristics that take place during puberty are often referred to in terms of five tanner stages , named after the british pediatrician who devised the categorization system .
common agreement about the day 's layout or schedule confers so many advantages that a standard dst schedule has generally been chosen over ad hoc efforts to get up earlier . the advantages of coordination are so great that many people ignore whether dst is in effect by altering their nominal work schedules to coordinate with television broadcasts or daylight . dst is commonly not observed during most of winter , because its mornings are darker ; workers may have no sunlit leisure time , and children may need to leave for school in the dark . since dst is applied to many varying communities , its effects may be very different depending on their culture , light levels , geography , and climate ; that is why it is hard to make generalized conclusions about the absolute effects of the practice . some areas may adopt dst simply as a matter of coordination with others rather than for any direct benefits .
imperial submitted a total of 1,257 staff across 14 units of assessment to the 2014 research excellence framework ( ref ) assessment . in the ref results 46 % of imperial 's submitted research was classified as 4 * , 44 % as 3 * , 9 % as 2 * and 1 % as 1 * , giving an overall gpa of 3.36 . in rankings produced by times higher education based upon the ref results imperial was ranked 2nd overall for gpa and 8th for " research power " ( compared to 6th and 7th respectively in the equivalent rankings for the rae 2008 ) .
in china , a call to boycott french hypermart carrefour from may 1 began spreading through mobile text messaging and online chat rooms amongst the chinese over the weekend from april 12 , accusing the company 's major shareholder , the lvmh group , of donating funds to the dalai lama . there were also calls to extend the boycott to include french luxury goods and cosmetic products . chinese protesters organized boycotts of the french-owned retail chain carrefour in major chinese cities including kunming , hefei and wuhan , accusing the french nation of pro-secessionist conspiracy and anti-chinese racism . some burned french flags , some added swastika ( due to its conotaions with nazism ) to the french flag , and spread short online messages calling for large protests in front of french consulates and embassy . some shoppers who insisted on entering one of the carrefour stores in kunming were blocked by boycotters wielding large chinese flags and hit by water bottles . hundreds of people joined anti-french rallies in beijing , wuhan , hefei , kunming and qingdao , which quickly spread to other cities like xi 'an , harbin and jinan . carrefour denied any support or involvement in the tibetan issue , and had its staff in its chinese stores wear uniforms emblazoned with the chinese national flag and caps with olympic insignia and as well as the words " beijing 2008 " to show its support for the games . the effort had to be ceased when the bocog deemed the use of official olympic insignia as illegal and a violation of copyright .
the american revolution begun with fighting at lexington and concord . on july 4 , 1776 , they issued the declaration of independence , which proclaimed their independence from great britain and their formation of a cooperative union . in june 1776 , benjamin franklin was appointed a member of the committee of five that drafted the declaration of independence . although he was temporarily disabled by gout and unable to attend most meetings of the committee , franklin made several small changes to the draft sent to him by thomas jefferson .
despite their usurpation of imperial authority , the fujiwara presided over a period of cultural and artistic flowering at the imperial court and among the aristocracy . there was great interest in graceful poetry and vernacular literature . two types of phonetic japanese script : katakana , a simplified script that was developed by using parts of chinese characters , was abbreviated to hiragana , a cursive syllabary with a distinct writing method that was uniquely japanese . hiragana gave written expression to the spoken word and , with it , to the rise in japan 's famous vernacular literature , much of it written by court women who had not been trained in chinese as had their male counterparts . three late tenth century and early eleventh century women presented their views of life and romance at the heian court in kagero nikki by " the mother of fujiwara michitsuna , " the pillow book by sei shonagon and the tale of genji by murasaki shikibu . indigenous art also flourished under the fujiwara after centuries of imitating chinese forms . vividly colored yamato-e , japanese style paintings of court life and stories about temples and shrines became common in the mid- and late heian periods , setting patterns for japanese art to this day .
the crimean war also saw the first tactical use of railways and other modern inventions , such as the electric telegraph , with the first " live " war reporting to the times by william howard russell . some credit russell with prompting the resignation of the sitting british government through his reporting of the lacklustre condition of british forces deployed in crimea . additionally , the telegraph reduced the independence of british overseas possessions from their commanders in london due to such rapid communications . newspaper readership informed public opinion in the united kingdom and france as never before . it was the first european war to be photographed .

when a molten metal is mixed with another substance , there are two mechanisms that can cause an alloy to form , called atom exchange and the interstitial mechanism . the relative size of each element in the mix plays a primary role in determining which mechanism will occur . when the atoms are relatively similar in size , the atom exchange method usually happens , where some of the atoms composing the metallic crystals are substituted with atoms of the other constituent . this is called a substitutional alloy . examples of substitutional alloys include bronze and brass , in which some of the copper atoms are substituted with either tin or zinc atoms . with the interstitial mechanism , one atom is usually much smaller than the other , so cannot successfully replace an atom in the crystals of the base metal . the smaller atoms become trapped in the spaces between the atoms in the crystal matrix , called the interstices . this is referred to as an interstitial alloy . steel is an example of an interstitial alloy , because the very small carbon atoms fit into interstices of the iron matrix . stainless steel is an example of a combination of interstitial and substitutional alloys , because the carbon atoms fit into the interstices , but some of the iron atoms are replaced with nickel and chromium atoms .
in september 2005 , west announced that he would release his pastelle clothing line in spring 2006 , claiming " now that i have a grammy under my belt and late registration is finished , i am ready to launch my clothing line next spring . " the line was developed over the following four years - with multiple pieces teased by west himself - before the line was ultimately cancelled in 2009 . in 2009 , west collaborated with nike to release his own shoe , the air yeezys , with a second version released in 2012 . in january 2009 , west introduced his first shoe line designed for louis vuitton during paris fashion week . the line was released in summer 2009 . west has additionally designed shoewear for bape and italian shoemaker giuseppe zanotti .
sichuan was china 's most populous province before chongqing became a directly-controlled municipality ; it is currently the fourth most populous , after guangdong , shandong and henan . as of 1832 , sichuan was the most populous of the 18 provinces in china , with an estimated population at that time of 21 million . it was the third most populous sub-national entity in the world , after uttar pradesh , india and the russian soviet federative socialist republic until 1991 , when the soviet union was dissolved . it is also one of the only six to ever reach 100 million people ( uttar pradesh , russian rsfsr , maharashtra , sichuan , bihar and punjab ) . it is currently 10th .
just as the navigational approach would require programs to loop in order to collect records , the relational approach would require loops to collect information about any one record . codd 's solution to the necessary looping was a set-oriented language , a suggestion that would later spawn the ubiquitous sql . using a branch of mathematics known as tuple calculus , he demonstrated that such a system could support all the operations of normal databases ( inserting , updating etc . ) as well as providing a simple system for finding and returning sets of data in a single operation .
von neumann founded the field of game theory as a mathematical discipline . von neumann proved his minimax theorem in 1928 . this theorem establishes that in zero-sum games with perfect information ( i.e. in which players know at each time all moves that have taken place so far ) , there exists a pair of strategies for both players that allows each to minimize his maximum losses , hence the name minimax . when examining every possible strategy , a player must consider all the possible responses of his adversary . the player then plays out the strategy that will result in the minimization of his maximum loss .
the assumption of the use of a two-beamed cross does not determine the number of nails used in the crucifixion and some theories suggest three nails while others suggest four nails . however , throughout history larger numbers of nails have been hypothesized , at times as high as 14 nails . these variations are also present in the artistic depictions of the crucifixion . in the western church , before the renaissance usually four nails would be depicted , with the feet side by side . after the renaissance most depictions use three nails , with one foot placed on the other . nails are almost always depicted in art , although romans sometimes just tied the victims to the cross . the tradition also carries to christian emblems , e.g. the jesuits use three nails under the ihs monogram and a cross to symbolize the crucifixion .
artspace on orange street is one of several contemporary art galleries around the city , showcasing the work of local , national , and international artists . others include city gallery and a. leaf gallery in the downtown area . westville galleries include kehler liddell , jennifer jane gallery , and the hungry eye . the erector square complex in the fair haven neighborhood houses the parachute factory gallery along with numerous artist studios , and the complex serves as an active destination during city-wide open studios held yearly in october .
as the european population was severely reduced , land became more plentiful for the survivors , and labour consequently more expensive . attempts by landowners to forcibly reduce wages , such as the english 1351 statute of laborers , were doomed to fail . these efforts resulted in nothing more than fostering resentment among the peasantry , leading to rebellions such as the french jacquerie in 1358 and the english peasants ' revolt in 1381 . the long-term effect was the virtual end of serfdom in western europe . in eastern europe , on the other hand , landowners were able to exploit the situation to force the peasantry into even more repressive bondage .
the presbyterian church in vanuatu is the largest denomination in the country , with approximately one-third of the population of vanuatu members of the church . the pcv was taken to vanuatu by missionaries from scotland . the pcv ( presbyterian church of vanuatu ) is headed by a moderator with offices in port vila . the pcv is particularly strong in the provinces of tafea , shefa , and malampa . the province of sanma is mainly presbyterian with a strong roman catholic minority in the francophone areas of the province . there are some presbyterian people , but no organised presbyterian churches in penama and torba , both of which are traditionally anglican . vanuatu is the only country in the south pacific with a significant presbyterian heritage and membership . the pcv is a founding member of the vanuatu christian council ( vcc ) . the pcv runs many primary schools and onesua secondary school . the church is strong in the rural villages .
for its official works and publications , the united nations organization groups countries under a classification of regions . the assignment of countries or areas to specific groupings is for statistical convenience and does not imply any assumption regarding political or other affiliation of countries or territories by the united nations . southern europe , as grouped for statistical convenience by the united nations ( the sub-regions according to the un ) , includes following countries and territories :

the egyptians begrudgingly accepted the ptolemies as the successors to the pharaohs of independent egypt , though the kingdom went through several native revolts . the ptolemies took on the traditions of the egyptian pharaohs , such as marrying their siblings ( ptolemy ii was the first to adopt this custom ) , having themselves portrayed on public monuments in egyptian style and dress , and participating in egyptian religious life . the ptolemaic ruler cult portrayed the ptolemies as gods , and temples to the ptolemies were erected throughout the kingdom . ptolemy i even created a new god , serapis , who was combination of two egyptian gods : apis and osiris , with attributes of greek gods . ptolemaic administration was , like the ancient egyptian bureaucracy , highly centralized and focused on squeezing as much revenue out of the population as possible though tariffs , excise duties , fines , taxes and so forth . a whole class of petty officials , tax farmers , clerks and overseers made this possible . the egyptian countryside was directly administered by this royal bureaucracy . external possessions such as cyprus and cyrene were run by strategoi , military commanders appointed by the crown .

at the time structures such as lie algebras and hyperbolic quaternions drew attention to the need to expand algebraic structures beyond the associatively multiplicative class . in a review alexander macfarlane wrote : " the main idea of the work is not unification of the several methods , nor generalization of ordinary algebra so as to include them , but rather the comparative study of their several structures . " in a separate review , g. b. mathews wrote , " it possesses a unity of design which is really remarkable , considering the variety of its themes . "
in december 2015 , west released a song titled " facts . " he announced in january 2016 on twitter that swish would be released on february 11 , after releasing new song " real friends " and a snippet of " no more parties in l.a. " with kendrick lamar . this also revived the good fridays initiative in which kanye releases new singles every friday . on january 26 , 2016 , west revealed he had renamed the album from swish to waves , and also announced the premier of his yeezy season 3 clothing line at madison square garden . in early 2016 , several weeks prior to the release of his new album , west became embroiled in a short-lived social media altercation with rapper wiz khalifa on twitter that eventually involved their mutual ex-partner , amber rose , who protested to west 's mention of her and khalifa 's child . the feud involved allegations by rose concerning her sexual relationship with west , and received significant media attention . as of february 2 , 2016 , west and khalifa had reconciled . several days ahead of the album 's release , west again changed the title , this time to the life of pablo . on february 11 , west premiered the album at madison square garden as part of the presentation of his yeezy season 3 clothing line . following the preview , west announced that he would be modifying the track list once more before its release to the public , and further delayed its release to finalize the recording of the track " waves " at the behest of co-writer chance the rapper . he released the album exclusively on tidal on 14 february 2016 following a performance on snl .
the newly invented western electric moving coil or dynamic microphone was part of the wide range system . it had a flatter audio response than the old style wente condenser type and didn 't require electronics installed in the microphone housing . signals fed to the cutting head were pre-emphasized in the treble region to help override noise in playback . groove cuts in the vertical plane were employed rather than the usual lateral cuts . the chief advantage claimed was more grooves per inch that could be crowded together , resulting in longer playback time . additionally , the problem of inner groove distortion , which plagued lateral cuts , could be avoided with the vertical cut system . wax masters were made by flowing heated wax over a hot metal disc thus avoiding the microscopic irregularities of cast blocks of wax and the necessity of planing and polishing .
bbc television is a service of the british broadcasting corporation . the corporation , which has operated in the united kingdom under the terms of a royal charter since 1927 , has produced television programmes from its own since 1932 , although the start of its regular service of television broadcasts is dated to 2 november 1936 .

in 2004 , a large share of natural gas reserves in iran were untapped . the addition of new hydroelectric stations and the streamlining of conventional coal and oil-fired stations increased installed capacity to 33,000 megawatts . of that amount , about 75 % was based on natural gas , 18 % on oil , and 7 % on hydroelectric power . in 2004 , iran opened its first wind-powered and geothermal plants , and the first solar thermal plant is to come online in 2009 . iran is the third country in the world to have developed gtl technology .
westminster abbey is a collegiate church governed by the dean and chapter of westminster , as established by royal charter of queen elizabeth i in 1560 , which created it as the collegiate church of st peter westminster and a royal peculiar under the personal jurisdiction of the sovereign . the members of the chapter are the dean and four canons residentiary , assisted by the receiver general and chapter clerk . one of the canons is also rector of st margaret 's church , westminster , and often holds also the post of chaplain to the speaker of the house of commons .
when the war began , the french government ordered a blockade of the north german coasts , which the small north german navy ( norddeutsche bundesmarine ) with only five ironclads could do little to oppose . for most of the war , the three largest german ironclads were out of service with engine troubles ; only the turret ship sms arminius was available to conduct operations . by the time engine repairs had been completed , the french fleet had already departed . the blockade proved only partially successful due to crucial oversights by the planners in paris . reservists that were supposed to be at the ready in case of war , were working in the newfoundland fisheries or in scotland . only part of the 470-ship french navy put to sea on 24 july . before long , the french navy ran short of coal , needing 200 short tons ( 180 t ) per day and having a bunker capacity in the fleet of only 250 short tons ( 230 t ) . a blockade of wilhelmshaven failed and conflicting orders about operations in the baltic sea or a return to france , made the french naval efforts futile . spotting a blockade-runner became unwelcome because of the question du charbon ; pursuit of prussian ships quickly depleted the coal reserves of the french ships .
the racial categories represent a social-political construct for the race or races that respondents consider themselves to be and " generally reflect a social definition of race recognized in this country .

on july 5 , 1779 , 2,600 loyalists and british regulars under general william tryon , governor of new york , landed in new haven harbor and raided the 3,500-person town . a militia of yale students had been prepping for battle , and former yale president and yale divinity school professor naphtali daggett rode out to confront the redcoats . yale president ezra stiles recounted in his diary that while he moved furniture in anticipation of battle , he still couldn 't quite believe the revolution had begun . new haven was not torched as the invaders did with danbury in 1777 , or fairfield and norwalk a week after the new haven raid , so many of the town 's colonial features were preserved .
there are scouting and guiding groups on saint helena and ascension island . scouting was established on saint helena island in 1912 . lord and lady baden-powell visited the scouts on saint helena on the return from their 1937 tour of africa . the visit is described in lord baden-powell 's book entitled african adventures .
various owners leased it from royal landlords and the freehold was the subject of frenzied speculation during the 17th century . by then , the old village of eye cross had long since fallen into decay , and the area was mostly wasteland . needing money , james i sold off part of the crown freehold but retained part of the site on which he established a 4-acre ( 16,000 m2 ) mulberry garden for the production of silk . ( this is at the northwest corner of today 's palace . ) clement walker in anarchia anglicana ( 1649 ) refers to " new-erected sodoms and spintries at the mulberry garden at s. james 's " ; this suggests it may have been a place of debauchery . eventually , in the late 17th century , the freehold was inherited from the property tycoon sir hugh audley by the great heiress mary davies .
though the country 's foreign relations , particularly with western nations , have been strained , relations have thawed since the reforms following the 2010 elections . after years of diplomatic isolation and economic and military sanctions , the united states relaxed curbs on foreign aid to myanmar in november 2011 and announced the resumption of diplomatic relations on 13 january 2012 the european union has placed sanctions on myanmar , including an arms embargo , cessation of trade preferences , and suspension of all aid with the exception of humanitarian aid .
before the latter half of the 18th century , grain , timber and then coal were plymouth 's main imports . during this time the real source of wealth was from the neighbouring town of plymouth dock ( renamed in 1824 to devonport ) and the major employer in the entire region was the dockyard . the three towns conurbation of plymouth , stonehouse and devonport enjoyed some prosperity during the late 18th and early 19th century and were enriched by a series of neo-classical urban developments designed by london architect john foulston . foulston was important for both devonport and plymouth and was responsible for several grand public buildings , many now destroyed , including the athenaeum , the theatre royal and royal hotel , and much of union street .
at the end of 1831 , chopin received the first major endorsement from an outstanding contemporary when robert schumann , reviewing the op. 2 variations in the allgemeine musikalische zeitung ( his first published article on music ) , declared : " hats off , gentlemen ! a genius . " on 26 february 1832 chopin gave a debut paris concert at the salle pleyel which drew universal admiration . the critic francois-joseph fetis wrote in the revue et gazette musicale : " here is a young man who ... taking no model , has found , if not a complete renewal of piano music , ... an abundance of original ideas of a kind to be found nowhere else ... " after this concert , chopin realized that his essentially intimate keyboard technique was not optimal for large concert spaces . later that year he was introduced to the wealthy rothschild banking family , whose patronage also opened doors for him to other private salons ( social gatherings of the aristocracy and artistic and literary elite ) . by the end of 1832 chopin had established himself among the parisian musical elite , and had earned the respect of his peers such as hiller , liszt , and berlioz . he no longer depended financially upon his father , and in the winter of 1832 he began earning a handsome income from publishing his works and teaching piano to affluent students from all over europe . this freed him from the strains of public concert-giving , which he disliked .
a pub / pʌb / , or public house is , despite its name , a private house , but is called a public house because it is licensed to sell alcohol to the general public . it is a drinking establishment in britain , ireland , new zealand , australia , canada , denmark and new england . in many places , especially in villages , a pub can be the focal point of the community . the writings of samuel pepys describe the pub as the heart of england .
by that time , the majority of black people in the united states were native-born , so the use of the term " african " became problematic . though initially a source of pride , many blacks feared that the use of african as an identity would be a hindrance to their fight for full citizenship in the us . they also felt that it would give ammunition to those who were advocating repatriating black people back to africa . in 1835 , black leaders called upon black americans to remove the title of " african " from their institutions and replace it with " negro " or " colored american . " a few institutions chose to keep their historic names , such as the african methodist episcopal church . african americans popularly used the terms " negro " or " colored " for themselves until the late 1960s .
by 1790 , the jewish population of alsace was approximately 22,500 , about 3 % of the provincial population . they were highly segregated and subject to long-standing anti-jewish regulations . they maintained their own customs , yiddish language , and historic traditions within the tightly-knit ghettos ; they adhered to talmudic law enforced by their rabbis . jews were barred from most cities and instead lived in villages . they concentrated in trade , services , and especially in money lending . they financed about a third of the mortgages in alsace . official tolerance grew during the french revolution , with full emancipation in 1791 . however , local antisemitism also increased and napoleon turned hostile in 1806 , imposing a one-year moratorium on all debts owed to jews . [ citation needed ] in the 1830-1870 era most jews moved to the cities , where they integrated and acculturated , as antisemitism sharply declined . by 1831 , the state began paying salaries to official rabbis , and in 1846 a special legal oath for jews was discontinued . antisemitic local riots occasionally occurred , especially during the revolution of 1848 . merger of alsace into germany in 1871-1918 lessened antisemitic violence .
a german trading company , the jaluit gesellschaft , administered the islands from 1887 until 1905 . they conscripted the islanders as laborers and mistreated them . after the german-spanish treaty of 1899 , in which germany acquired the carolines , palau , and the marianas from spain , germany placed all of its micronesian islands , including the marshalls , under the governor of german new guinea .
pesticides are substances meant for attracting , seducing , and then destroying any pest . they are a class of biocide . the most common use of pesticides is as plant protection products ( also known as crop protection products ) , which in general protect plants from damaging influences such as weeds , fungi , or insects . this use of pesticides is so common that the term pesticide is often treated as synonymous with plant protection product , although it is in fact a broader term , as pesticides are also used for non-agricultural purposes . the term pesticide includes all of the following : herbicide , insecticide , insect growth regulator , nematicide , termiticide , molluscicide , piscicide , avicide , rodenticide , predacide , bactericide , insect repellent , animal repellent , antimicrobial , fungicide , disinfectant ( antimicrobial ) , and sanitizer .
many television shows and films have been produced which portray in-character professional wrestlers as protagonists , such as ready to rumble , ¡ mucha lucha ! , nacho libre , and the santo film series . in the wildly popular rocky series of films about the fictional boxer rocky balboa , rocky iii saw its hero fighting a " boxer vs. wrestler " exhibition match against the enormous and villainous wrestler " thunderlips , " portrayed by real-life soon-to-be wrestling icon hulk hogan . at least two stage plays set in the world of pro wrestling have been produced : the baron is a comedy that retells the life of an actual performer known as baron von raschke . from parts unknown ... is an award-nominated canadian drama about the rise and fall of a fictional wrestler . the 2009 south park episode " w.t.f. " played on the soap operatic elements of professional wrestling . one of the lead characters on the disney channel series kim possible was a huge fan of pro wrestling and actually featured it on an episode ( with two former wwe wrestlers voicing the two fictitious wrestlers featured in the episode ) . the 2008 film the wrestler , about a washed-up professional wrestler , garnered several oscar nominations .
while the big bang model is well established in cosmology , it is likely to be refined in the future . little is known about the earliest moments of the universe 's history . the penrose-hawking singularity theorems require the existence of a singularity at the beginning of cosmic time . however , these theorems assume that general relativity is correct , but general relativity must break down before the universe reaches the planck temperature , and a correct treatment of quantum gravity may avoid the singularity .
estonia lies on the eastern shores of the baltic sea immediately across the gulf of finland from finland on the level northwestern part of the rising east european platform between 57.3 ° and 59.5 ° n and 21.5 ° and 28.1 ° e. average elevation reaches only 50 metres ( 164 ft ) and the country 's highest point is the suur munamagi in the southeast at 318 metres ( 1,043 ft ) . there is 3,794 kilometres ( 2,357 mi ) of coastline marked by numerous bays , straits , and inlets . the number of islands and islets is estimated at some 2,355 ( including those in lakes ) . two of them are large enough to constitute separate counties : saaremaa and hiiumaa . a small , recent cluster of meteorite craters , the largest of which is called kaali is found on saaremaa , estonia .
so an additional problem beyond canceling the unwanted reactance is of matching the remaining resistive impedance to the characteristic impedance of the transmission line . in principle this can always be done with a transformer , however the turns ratio of a transformer is not adjustable . a general matching network with at least two adjustments can be made to correct both components of impedance . matching networks using discrete inductors and capacitors will have losses associated with those components , and will have power restrictions when used for transmitting . avoiding these difficulties , commercial antennas are generally designed with fixed matching elements or feeding strategies to get an approximate match to standard coax , such as 50 or 75 ohms . antennas based on the dipole ( rather than vertical antennas ) should include a balun in between the transmission line and antenna element , which may be integrated into any such matching network .
in jurisdictions using a common law system , the doctrine of stare decisis applies , whereby the principles applied by the supreme court in its decisions are binding upon all lower courts ; this is intended to apply a uniform interpretation and implementation of the law . in civil law jurisdictions the doctrine of stare decisis is not generally considered to apply , so the decisions of the supreme court are not necessarily binding beyond the immediate case before it ; however , in practice the decisions of the supreme court usually provide a very strong precedent , or jurisprudence constante , for both itself and all lower courts .
in the uk , the medicines and healthcare products regulatory agency approves drugs for use , though the evaluation is done by the european medicines agency , an agency of the european union based in london . normally an approval in the uk and other european countries comes later than one in the usa . then it is the national institute for health and care excellence ( nice ) , for england and wales , who decides if and how the national health service ( nhs ) will allow ( in the sense of paying for ) their use . the british national formulary is the core guide for pharmacists and clinicians .
the bronx museum of the arts , founded in 1971 , exhibits 20th century and contemporary art through its central museum space and 11,000 square feet ( 1,000 m2 ) of galleries . many of its exhibitions are on themes of special interest to the bronx . its permanent collection features more than 800 works of art , primarily by artists from africa , asia and latin america , including paintings , photographs , prints , drawings , and mixed media . the museum was temporarily closed in 2006 while it underwent a major expansion designed by the architectural firm arquitectonica .
nevertheless , although a distinction between lawful and unlawful hunting is undoubtedly permissible , it is certain that a bishop can absolutely prohibit all hunting to the clerics of his diocese , as was done by synods at milan , avignon , liege , cologne , and elsewhere . benedict xiv ( de synodo diœces . , l . ii , c. x ) declared that such synodal decrees are not too severe , as an absolute prohibition of hunting is more conformable to the ecclesiastical law . in practice , therefore , the synodal statutes of various localities must be consulted to discover whether they allow quiet hunting or prohibit it altogether .
there are over three thousand islands along the rugged coastline of zhejiang . the largest , zhoushan island , is mainland china 's third largest island , after hainan and chongming . there are also many bays , of which hangzhou bay is the largest . zhejiang has a humid subtropical climate with four distinct seasons . spring starts in march and is rainy with changeable weather . summer , from june to september is long , hot , rainy , and humid . fall is generally dry , warm and sunny . winters are short but cold except in the far south . average annual temperature is around 15 to 19 ° c ( 59 to 66 ° f ) , average january temperature is around 2 to 8 ° c ( 36 to 46 ° f ) and average july temperature is around 27 to 30 ° c ( 81 to 86 ° f ) . annual precipitation is about 1,000 to 1,900 mm ( 39 to 75 in ) . there is plenty of rainfall in early summer , and by late summer zhejiang is directly threatened by typhoons forming in the pacific .
british somaliland became independent on 26 june 1960 as the state of somaliland , and the trust territory of somalia ( the former italian somaliland ) followed suit five days later . on 1 july 1960 , the two territories united to form the somali republic , albeit within boundaries drawn up by italy and britain . a government was formed by abdullahi issa mohamud and muhammad haji ibrahim egal other members of the trusteeship and protectorate governments , with haji bashir ismail yusuf as president of the somali national assembly , aden abdullah osman daar as the president of the somali republic and abdirashid ali shermarke as prime minister ( later to become president from 1967 to 1969 ) . on 20 july 1961 and through a popular referendum , the people of somalia ratified a new constitution , which was first drafted in 1960 . in 1967 , muhammad haji ibrahim egal became prime minister , a position to which he was appointed by shermarke . egal would later become the president of the autonomous somaliland region in northwestern somalia .

the decade began with the melbourne international exhibition in 1880 , held in the large purpose-built exhibition building . in 1880 a telephone exchange was established and in the same year the foundations of st paul 's , were laid ; in 1881 electric light was installed in the eastern market , and in the following year a generating station capable of supplying 2,000 incandescent lamps was in operation . in 1885 the first line of the melbourne cable tramway system was built , becoming one of the worlds most extensive systems by 1890 .
the greater mexico city has a gross domestic product ( gdp ) of us $ 411 billion in 2011 , making mexico city urban agglomeration one of the economically largest metropolitan areas in the world . the city was responsible for generating 15.8 % of mexico 's gross domestic product and the metropolitan area accounted for about 22 % of total national gdp . as a stand-alone country , in 2013 , mexico city would be the fifth-largest economy in latin america - five times as large as costa rica 's and about the same size as peru 's .
in 2002 switzerland became a full member of the united nations , leaving the vatican city as the last widely recognised state without full un membership . switzerland is a founding member of the efta , but is not a member of the european economic area . an application for membership in the european union was sent in may 1992 , but not advanced since the eea was rejected in december 1992 when switzerland was the only country to launch a referendum on the eea . there have since been several referenda on the eu issue ; due to a mixed reaction from the population the membership application has been frozen . nonetheless , swiss law is gradually being adjusted to conform with that of the eu , and the government has signed a number of bilateral agreements with the european union . switzerland , together with liechtenstein , has been completely surrounded by the eu since austria 's entry in 1995 . on 5 june 2005 , swiss voters agreed by a 55 % majority to join the schengen treaty , a result that was regarded by eu commentators as a sign of support by switzerland , a country that is traditionally perceived as independent and reluctant to enter supranational bodies .
ibn sina subsequently settled at rey , in the vicinity of modern tehran , the home town of rhazes ; where majd addaula , a son of the last buwayhid emir , was nominal ruler under the regency of his mother ( seyyedeh khatun ) . about thirty of ibn sina 's shorter works are said to have been composed in rey . constant feuds which raged between the regent and her second son , shams al-daula , however , compelled the scholar to quit the place . after a brief sojourn at qazvin he passed southwards to hamadan where shams al-daula , another buwayhid emir , had established himself . at first , ibn sina entered into the service of a high-born lady ; but the emir , hearing of his arrival , called him in as medical attendant , and sent him back with presents to his dwelling . ibn sina was even raised to the office of vizier . the emir decreed that he should be banished from the country . ibn sina , however , remained hidden for forty days in sheikh ahmed fadhel 's house , until a fresh attack of illness induced the emir to restore him to his post . even during this perturbed time , ibn sina persevered with his studies and teaching . every evening , extracts from his great works , the canon and the sanatio , were dictated and explained to his pupils . on the death of the emir , ibn sina ceased to be vizier and hid himself in the house of an apothecary , where , with intense assiduity , he continued the composition of his works .
it is possible with protein combinations of two incomplete protein sources ( e.g. , rice and beans ) to make a complete protein source , and characteristic combinations are the basis of distinct cultural cooking traditions . however , complementary sources of protein do not need to be eaten at the same meal to be used together by the body . excess amino acids from protein can be converted into glucose and used for fuel through a process called gluconeogenesis . the amino acids remaining after such conversion are discarded .
sumerian religion seems to have been founded upon two separate cosmogenic myths . the first saw creation as the result of a series of hieros gami or sacred marriages , involving the reconciliation of opposites , postulated as a coming together of male and female divine beings ; the gods . this continued to influence the whole mesopotamian mythos . thus in the enuma elish the creation was seen as the union of fresh and salt water ; as male abzu , and female tiamat . the product of that union , lahm and lahmu , " the muddy ones , " were titles given to the gate keepers of the e-abzu temple of enki , in eridu , the first sumerian city . describing the way that muddy islands emerge from the confluence of fresh and salty water at the mouth of the euphrates , where the river deposited its load of silt , a second hieros gamos supposedly created anshar and kishar , the " sky-pivot " or axle , and the " earth pivot , " parents in turn of anu ( the sky ) and ki ( the earth ) . another important sumerian hieros gamos was that between ki , here known as ninhursag or " lady sacred mountain , " and enki of eridu , the god of fresh water which brought forth greenery and pasture .
falling prices also resulted in homes worth less than the mortgage loan , providing a financial incentive to enter foreclosure . the ongoing foreclosure epidemic that began in late 2006 in the u.s. continues to drain wealth from consumers and erodes the financial strength of banking institutions . defaults and losses on other loan types also increased significantly as the crisis expanded from the housing market to other parts of the economy . total losses are estimated in the trillions of u.s. dollars globally .
in the china digital times an article reports a close analysis by an alleged chinese construction engineer known online as " book blade " ( 书剑子 ) , who stated :
according to his autobiography , avicenna had memorised the entire quran by the age of 10 . he learned indian arithmetic from an indian greengrocer , ءmahmoud massahi and he began to learn more from a wandering scholar who gained a livelihood by curing the sick and teaching the young . he also studied fiqh ( islamic jurisprudence ) under the sunni hanafi scholar ismail al-zahid . avicenna was taught some extent of philosophy books such as introduction ( isagoge ) ' s porphyry ( philosopher ) , euclid 's elements , ptolemy 's almagest by an unpopular philosopher , abu abdullah nateli , who claimed philosophizing .

the law of the united states comprises many levels of codified and uncodified forms of law , of which the most important is the united states constitution , the foundation of the federal government of the united states . the constitution sets out the boundaries of federal law , which consists of acts of congress , treaties ratified by the senate , regulations promulgated by the executive branch , and case law originating from the federal judiciary . the united states code is the official compilation and codification of general and permanent federal statutory law .
some skyscraper buildings and other types of installation feature a destination operating panel where a passenger registers their floor calls before entering the car . the system lets them know which car to wait for , instead of everyone boarding the next car . in this way , travel time is reduced as the elevator makes fewer stops for individual passengers , and the computer distributes adjacent stops to different cars in the bank . although travel time is reduced , passenger waiting times may be longer as they will not necessarily be allocated the next car to depart . during the down peak period the benefit of destination control will be limited as passengers have a common destination .
the pacific war saw the allied powers pitted against the empire of japan , the latter briefly aided by thailand and to a much lesser extent by its axis allies , germany and italy . the war culminated in the atomic bombings of hiroshima and nagasaki , and other large aerial bomb attacks by the united states army air forces , accompanied by the soviet invasion of manchuria on 8 august 1945 , resulting in the japanese announcement of intent to surrender on 15 august 1945 . the formal and official surrender of japan took place aboard the battleship uss missouri in tokyo bay on 2 september 1945 . following its defeat , japan 's shinto emperor stepped down as the divine leader through the shinto directive , because the allied powers believed this was the major political cause of japan 's military aggression and deconstruction process soon took place to install a new liberal-democratic constitution to the japanese public as the current constitution of japan .
whittaker was unsuited for the role and soon retired . stewart and harlan were conservative republicans , while brennan was a democrat who became a leading voice for liberalism . in selecting a chief justice , eisenhower looked for an experienced jurist who could appeal to liberals in the party as well as law-and-order conservatives , noting privately that warren " represents the kind of political , economic , and social thinking that i believe we need on the supreme court ... he has a national name for integrity , uprightness , and courage that , again , i believe we need on the court . " in the next few years warren led the court in a series of liberal decisions that revolutionized the role of the court .
before going to iberia , napoleon decided to address several lingering issues with the russians . at the congress of erfurt in october 1808 , napoleon hoped to keep russia on his side during the upcoming struggle in spain and during any potential conflict against austria . the two sides reached an agreement , the erfurt convention , that called upon britain to cease its war against france , that recognized the russian conquest of finland from sweden , and that affirmed russian support for france in a possible war against austria " to the best of its ability . " napoleon then returned to france and prepared for war . the grande armee , under the emperor 's personal command , rapidly crossed the ebro river in november 1808 and inflicted a series of crushing defeats against the spanish forces . after clearing the last spanish force guarding the capital at somosierra , napoleon entered madrid on 4 december with 80,000 troops . he then unleashed his soldiers against moore and the british forces . the british were swiftly driven to the coast , and they withdrew from spain entirely after a last stand at the battle of corunna in january 1809 .
ge has said that it will invest $ 1.4 billion in clean technology research and development in 2008 as part of its ecomagination initiative . as of october 2008 , the scheme had resulted in 70 green products being brought to market , ranging from halogen lamps to biogas engines . in 2007 , ge raised the annual revenue target for its ecomagination initiative from $ 20 billion in 2010 to $ 25 billion following positive market response to its new product lines . in 2010 , ge continued to raise its investment by adding $ 10 billion into ecomagination over the next five years .
the sweet wort collected from sparging is put into a kettle , or " copper " ( so called because these vessels were traditionally made from copper ) , and boiled , usually for about one hour . during boiling , water in the wort evaporates , but the sugars and other components of the wort remain ; this allows more efficient use of the starch sources in the beer . boiling also destroys any remaining enzymes left over from the mashing stage . hops are added during boiling as a source of bitterness , flavour and aroma . hops may be added at more than one point during the boil . the longer the hops are boiled , the more bitterness they contribute , but the less hop flavour and aroma remains in the beer .
general dong zhuo ( d . 192 ad ) found the young emperor and his brother wandering in the countryside . he escorted them safely back to the capital and was made minister of works , taking control of luoyang and forcing yuan shao to flee . after dong zhuo demoted emperor shao and promoted his brother liu xie as emperor xian , yuan shao led a coalition of former officials and officers against dong , who burned luoyang to the ground and resettled the court at chang 'an in may 191 ad . dong zhuo later poisoned emperor shao .
davies identifies paine 's the age of reason as " the link between the two major narratives of what jean-francois lyotard calls the narrative of legitimation " : the rationalism of the 18th-century philosophes and the radical , historically based german 19th-century biblical criticism of the hegelians david friedrich strauss and ludwig feuerbach . " the first is political , largely french in inspiration , and projects ' humanity as the hero of liberty ' . the second is philosophical , german , seeks the totality and autonomy of knowledge , and stresses understanding rather than freedom as the key to human fulfilment and emancipation . the two themes converged and competed in complex ways in the 19th century and beyond , and between them set the boundaries of its various humanisms . homo homini deus est ( " the human being is a god to humanity " or " god is nothing [ other than ] the human being to himself " ) , feuerbach had written .
a second neoclassic wave , more severe , more studied and more consciously archaeological , is associated with the height of the napoleonic empire . in france , the first phase of neoclassicism was expressed in the " louis xvi style , " and the second in the styles called " directoire " or empire . the rococo style remained popular in italy until the napoleonic regimes brought the new archaeological classicism , which was embraced as a political statement by young , progressive , urban italians with republican leanings . [ according to whom ? ]
norfolk island was colonised by east polynesians but was long unpeopled when it was settled by great britain as part of its settlement of australia from 1788 . the island served as a convict penal settlement from 6 march 1788 until 5 may 1855 , except for an 11-year hiatus between 15 february 1814 and 6 june 1825 , when it lay abandoned . on 8 june 1856 , permanent civilian residence on the island began when it was settled from pitcairn island . in 1913 , the uk handed norfolk over to australia to administer as an external territory .
a year before alfonso iii " the great " of asturias death , three of alfonso 's sons rose in rebellion and forced him to abdicate , partitioning the kingdom among them . the eldest son , garcia , became king of leon . the second son , ordono , reigned in galicia , while the third , fruela , received asturias with oviedo as his capital . alfonso died in zamora , probably in 910 . his former realm would be reunited when first garcia died childless and leon passed to ordono . he in turn died when his children were too young to ascend ; fruela became king of a reunited crown . his death the next year initiated a series of internecine struggles that led to unstable succession for over a century . it continued under that name [ clarification needed ] until incorporated into the kingdom of castile in 1230 , after ferdinand iii became joint king of the two kingdoms . this was done to avoid dynastic feuds and to maintain the christian kingdoms strong enough to prevent complete muslim take over of the iberian peninsula and to further the reconquista of iberia by christian armies .
another initiative , presented by the late mayor thomas menino , is the renew boston whole building incentive , which reduces the cost of living in buildings that are deemed energy efficient . this , much like the green housing developments , gives people of low socioeconomic status an opportunity to find housing in communities that support the environment . the ultimate goal of this initiative is to enlist 500 bostonians to participate in a free , in-home energy assessment .
the state united behind the plan of ayutla and ratified the new constitution in 1855 . the state was able to survive through the reform war with minimal damage due to the large number of liberal political figures . the 1858 conservative movement did not succeed in the state even after the successful military campaign of the conservative zuloaga with 1,000 men occupied the cities of chihuahua and parral . in august 1859 , zuloaga and his forces were defeated by the liberal orozco and his forces ; orozco soon after deposed the state governor , but had to flee to durango two months later . in the late 1860s the conservative general cajen briefly entered the state after his campaign through the state of jalisco and helped establish conservative politicians and ran out the liberal leaders jesus gonzalez ortega and jose maria patoni . cajen took possession of the state capital and established himself as governor ; he brooked no delay in uniting a large force to combat the liberal forces which he defeated in la batalla del gallo . cajen attained several advantages over the liberals within the state , but soon lost his standing due to a strong resurgence of the liberal forces within the state . the successful liberal leaders jose maria patoni of durango and j.e. munoz of chihuahua quickly strengthened their standing by limiting the political rights of the clergy implementing the presidential decree . the state elected general luis terrazas , a liberal leader , as governor ; he would continue to fight small battles within the state to suppress conservative uprisings during 1861 .
alpine plants such the alpine gentian grow in abundance in areas such as the meadows above the lauterbrunnental . gentians are named after the illyrian king gentius , and 40 species of the early-spring blooming flower grow in the alps , in a range of 1,500 to 2,400 m ( 4,921 to 7,874 ft ) . writing about the gentians in switzerland d. h. lawrence described them as " darkening the day-time , torch-like with the smoking blueness of pluto 's gloom . " gentians tend to " appear " repeatedly as the spring blooming takes place at progressively later dates , moving from the lower altitude to the higher altitude meadows where the snow melts much later than in the valleys . on the highest rocky ledges the spring flowers bloom in the summer .
in 1906 , the franchise recorded a major league record 116 wins ( tied by the 2001 seattle mariners ) and posted a modern-era record winning percentage of .763 , which still stands today . they appeared in their first world series the same year , falling to their crosstown rivals , the chicago white sox , four games to two . the cubs won back-to-back world series championships in 1907 and 1908 , becoming the first major league team to play in three consecutive fall classics , and the first to win it twice . the team has appeared in seven world series following their 1908 title , most recently in 1945 . the cubs have not won the world series in 107 years , the longest championship drought of any major north american professional sports team , and are often referred to as the " lovable losers " because of this distinction . they are also known as " the north siders " because wrigley field , their home park since 1916 , is located in chicago 's north side lake view community at 1060 west addison street . the cubs have a major rivalry with the st. louis cardinals .
the earliest reference to the magadha people occurs in the atharva-veda where they are found listed along with the angas , gandharis , and mujavats . magadha played an important role in the development of jainism and buddhism , and two of india 's greatest empires , the maurya empire and gupta empire , originated from magadha . these empires saw advancements in ancient india 's science , mathematics , astronomy , religion , and philosophy and were considered the indian " golden age . " the magadha kingdom included republican communities such as the community of rajakumara . villages had their own assemblies under their local chiefs called gramakas . their administrations were divided into executive , judicial , and military functions .
mithridates the great was the ruler of pontus , a large kingdom in asia minor ( modern turkey ) , from 120 to 63 bc . mithridates antagonised rome by seeking to expand his kingdom , and rome for her part seemed equally eager for war and the spoils and prestige that it might bring . in 88 bc , mithridates ordered the killing of a majority of the 80,000 romans living in his kingdom . the massacre was the official reason given for the commencement of hostilities in the first mithridatic war . the roman general lucius cornelius sulla forced mithridates out of greece proper , but then had to return to italy to answer the internal threat posed by his rival , gaius marius . a peace was made between rome and pontus , but this proved only a temporary lull .
one by one , additional large hotels were constructed along the boardwalk , including the brighton , chelsea , shelburne , ambassador , ritz carlton , mayflower , madison house , and the breakers . the quaker-owned chalfonte house , opened in 1868 , and haddon house , opened in 1869 , flanked north carolina avenue at the beach end . their original wood-frame structures would be enlarged , and even moved closer to the beach , over the years . the modern chalfonte hotel , eight stories tall , opened in 1904 . the modern haddon hall was built in stages and was completed in 1929 , at eleven stories . by this time , they were under the same ownership and merged into the chalfonte-haddon hall hotel , becoming the city 's largest hotel with nearly 1,000 rooms . by 1930 , the claridge , the city 's last large hotel before the casinos , opened its doors . the 400-room claridge was built by a partnership that included renowned philadelphia contractor john mcshain . at 24 stories , it would become known as the " skyscraper by the sea . " the city became known as the " the world 's playground .
the deliberate or accidental hybridising of two or more species of closely related animals through captive breeding is a human activity which has been in existence for millennia and has grown in recent times for economic purposes . the number of successful interspecific mammalian hybrids is relatively small , although it has come to be known that there is a significant number of naturally occurring hybrids between forms or regional varieties of a single species . [ citation needed ] these may form zones of gradation known as clines . indeed , the distinction between some hitherto distinct species can become clouded once it can be shown that they may not only breed but produce fertile offspring . some hybrid animals exhibit greater strength and resilience than either parent . this is known as hybrid vigor . the existence of the mule ( donkey sire ; horse dam ) being used widely as a hardy draught animal throughout ancient and modern history is testament to this . other well known examples are the lion / tiger hybrid , the liger , which is by far the largest big cat and sometimes used in circuses ; and cattle hybrids such as between european and indian domestic cattle or between domestic cattle and american bison , which are used in the meat industry and marketed as beefalo . there is some speculation that the donkey itself may be the result of an ancient hybridisation between two wild ass species or sub-species . hybrid animals are normally infertile partly because their parents usually have slightly different numbers of chromosomes , resulting in unpaired chromosomes in their cells , which prevents division of sex cells and the gonads from operating correctly , particularly in males . there are exceptions to this rule , especially if the speciation process was relatively recent or incomplete as is the case with many cattle and dog species . normally behavior traits , natural hostility , natural ranges and breeding cycle differences maintain the separateness of closely related species and prevent natural hybridisation . however , the widespread disturbances to natural animal behaviours and range caused by human activity , cities , dumping grounds with food , agriculture , fencing , roads and so on do force animals together which would not normally breed . clear examples exist between the various sub-species of grey wolf , coyote and domestic dog in north america . as many birds and mammals imprint on their mother and immediate family from infancy , a practice used by animal hybridizers is to foster a planned parent in a hybridization program with the same species as the one with which they are planned to mate .
after his coronation , john moved south into france with military forces and adopted a defensive posture along the eastern and southern normandy borders . both sides paused for desultory negotiations before the war recommenced ; john 's position was now stronger , thanks to confirmation that the counts baldwin ix of flanders and renaud of boulogne had renewed the anti-french alliances they had previously agreed to with richard . the powerful anjou nobleman william des roches was persuaded to switch sides from arthur to john ; suddenly the balance seemed to be tipping away from philip and arthur in favour of john . neither side was keen to continue the conflict , and following a papal truce the two leaders met in january 1200 to negotiate possible terms for peace . from john 's perspective , what then followed represented an opportunity to stabilise control over his continental possessions and produce a lasting peace with philip in paris . john and philip negotiated the may 1200 treaty of le goulet ; by this treaty , philip recognised john as the rightful heir to richard in respect to his french possessions , temporarily abandoning the wider claims of his client , arthur . [ nb 4 ] john , in turn , abandoned richard 's former policy of containing philip through alliances with flanders and boulogne , and accepted philip 's right as the legitimate feudal overlord of john 's lands in france . john 's policy earned him the disrespectful title of " john softsword " from some english chroniclers , who contrasted his behaviour with his more aggressive brother , richard .
in 2006 , lee was awarded an honorary doctorate from the university of notre dame . during the ceremony , the students and audience gave lee a standing ovation , and the entire graduating class held up copies of to kill a mockingbird to honor her . [ note 5 ] lee was awarded the presidential medal of freedom on november 5 , 2007 by president george w. bush . in his remarks , bush stated , " one reason to kill a mockingbird succeeded is the wise and kind heart of the author , which comes through on every page ... to kill a mockingbird has influenced the character of our country for the better . it 's been a gift to the entire world . as a model of good writing and humane sensibility , this book will be read and studied forever . "
nicholas felt that , because of russian assistance in suppressing the hungarian revolution of 1848 , austria would side with him , or at the very least remain neutral . austria , however , felt threatened by the russian troops in the balkans . on 27 february 1854 , the united kingdom and france demanded the withdrawal of russian forces from the principalities ; austria supported them and , though it did not declare war on russia , it refused to guarantee its neutrality . russia 's rejection of the ultimatum caused the uk and france to enter the war .
heartwood ( or duramen ) is wood that as a result of a naturally occurring chemical transformation has become more resistant to decay . heartwood formation occurs spontaneously ( it is a genetically programmed process ) . once heartwood formation is complete , the heartwood is dead . some uncertainty still exists as to whether heartwood is truly dead , as it can still chemically react to decay organisms , but only once .
the santa monica looff hippodrome ( carousel ) is a national historic landmark . it sits on the santa monica pier , which was built in 1909 . the la monica ballroom on the pier was once the largest ballroom in the us and the source for many new year 's eve national network broadcasts . the santa monica civic auditorium was an important music venue for several decades and hosted the academy awards in the 1960s . mccabe 's guitar shop is still a leading acoustic performance space as well as retail outlet . bergamot station is a city-owned art gallery compound that includes the santa monica museum of art . the city is also home to the california heritage museum and the angels attic dollhouse and toy museum .
in 1863 , the newly founded football association ( the fa ) published the laws of the game of association football , unifying the various different rules in use before then . on 20 july 1871 , in the offices of the sportsman newspaper , the fa secretary c. w. alcock proposed to the fa committee that " it is desirable that a challenge cup should be established in connection with the association for which all clubs belonging to the association should be invited to compete . " the inaugural fa cup tournament kicked off in november 1871 . after thirteen games in all , wanderers were crowned the winners in the final , on 16 march 1872 . wanderers retained the trophy the following year . the modern cup was beginning to be established by the 1888-89 season , when qualifying rounds were introduced .
central catalan is considered the standard pronunciation of the language . the descriptions below are mostly for this variety . for the differences in pronunciation of the different dialects , see the section pronunciation of dialects in this article .
up to 1990 , english , german and afrikaans were official languages . long before namibia 's independence from south africa , swapo was of the opinion that the country should become officially monolingual , choosing this approach in contrast to that of its neighbour south africa ( which granted all 11 of its major languages official status ) , which was seen by them as " a deliberate policy of ethnolinguistic fragmentation . " consequently , swapo instituted english as the sole official language of namibia though only about 3 % of the population speaks it as a home language . its implementation is focused on the civil service , education and the broadcasting system . some other languages have received semi-official recognition by being allowed as medium of instruction in primary schools . it is expected of private schools to follow the same policy as state schools , and " english language " is a compulsory subject . as in other postcolonial african societies , the push for monolingual instruction and policy has resulted in a high rate of school drop-outs and of individuals whose academic competence in any language is low .
scientists are still debating when people started wearing clothes . ralf kittler , manfred kayser and mark stoneking , anthropologists at the max planck institute for evolutionary anthropology , have conducted a genetic analysis of human body lice that suggests clothing originated quite recently , around 170,000 years ago . body lice is an indicator of clothes-wearing , since most humans have sparse body hair , and lice thus require human clothing to survive . their research suggests the invention of clothing may have coincided with the northward migration of modern homo sapiens away from the warm climate of africa , thought to have begun between 50,000 and 100,000 years ago . however , a second group of researchers using similar genetic methods estimate that clothing originated around 540,000 years ago ( reed et al . 2004 . plos biology 2 ( 11 ) : e340 ) . for now , the date of the origin of clothing remains unresolved .

in practice , because of sovereignty , any state can withdraw from any treaty at any time . the question of whether this is permitted is really a question of how other states will react to the withdrawal ; for instance , another state might impose sanctions or go to war over a treaty violation .
north korea : the event was held in pyongyang on april 28 . it was the first time that the olympic torch has traveled to north korea . a crowd of thousands waving pink paper flowers and small flags with the beijing olympics logo were organized by the authoritarian regime watched the beginning of the relay in pyongyang , some waving chinese flags . the event was presided over by the head of the country 's parliament , kim yong nam . the north , an ally of china , has been critical of disruptions to the torch relay elsewhere and has supported beijing in its actions against protests in tibet . kim passed the torch to the first runner pak du ik , who played on north korea 's 1966 world cup soccer team , as he began the 19-kilometre route through pyongyang . the relay began from the large sculpted flame of the obelisk of the juche tower , which commemorates the national ideology of juche , or " self-reliance , " created by the country 's late founding president kim il sung , father of leader kim jong il , who did not attend .
the only cosmetic difference between an rlv disc and a regular factory-pressed laserdiscs is their reflective purple-violet ( or blue with some rlv discs ) color resulting from the dye embedded in the reflective layer of the disc to make it recordable , as opposed to the silver mirror appearance of regular lds . the purplish color of rlvs is very similar to dvd-r and dvd + r discs . rlvs were popular for making short-run quantities of laserdiscs for specialized applications such as interactive kiosks and flight simulators .
armenia presently maintains good relations with almost every country in the world , with two major exceptions being its immediate neighbours , turkey and azerbaijan . tensions were running high between armenians and azerbaijanis during the final years of the soviet union . the nagorno-karabakh war dominated the region 's politics throughout the 1990s . the border between the two rival countries remains closed up to this day , and a permanent solution for the conflict has not been reached despite the mediation provided by organisations such as the osce .
interstate 10 , which runs southeast to northwest through town , connects tucson to phoenix to the northwest on the way to its western terminus in santa monica , california , and to las cruces , new mexico and el paso , texas toward its eastern terminus in jacksonville , florida . i-19 runs south from tucson toward nogales and the u.s.-mexico border . i-19 is the only interstate highway that uses " kilometer posts " instead of " mileposts , " although the speed limits are marked in miles per hour instead of kilometers per hour .
other armenian diasporans that rose to fame in classical or international music circles are world-renowned french-armenian singer and composer charles aznavour , pianist sahan arzruni , prominent opera sopranos such as hasmik papian and more recently isabel bayrakdarian and anna kasyan . certain armenians settled to sing non-armenian tunes such as the heavy metal band system of a down ( which nonetheless often incorporates traditional armenian instrumentals and styling into their songs ) or pop star cher . in the armenian diaspora , armenian revolutionary songs are popular with the youth . these songs encourage armenian patriotism and are generally about armenian history and national heroes .
in sri lanka , the supreme court of sri lanka was created in 1972 after the adoption of a new constitution . the supreme court is the highest and final superior court of record and is empowered to exercise its powers , subject to the provisions of the constitution . the court rulings take precedence over all lower courts . the sri lanka judicial system is complex blend of both common-law and civil-law . in some cases such as capital punishment , the decision may be passed on to the president of the republic for clemency petitions . however , when there is 2 / 3 majority in the parliament in favour of president ( as with present ) , the supreme court and its judges ' powers become nullified as they could be fired from their positions according to the constitution , if the president wants . therefore , in such situations , civil law empowerment vanishes .
neurotransmitters are chemicals that are released at synapses when an action potential activates them - neurotransmitters attach themselves to receptor molecules on the membrane of the synapse 's target cell , and thereby alter the electrical or chemical properties of the receptor molecules . with few exceptions , each neuron in the brain releases the same chemical neurotransmitter , or combination of neurotransmitters , at all the synaptic connections it makes with other neurons ; this rule is known as dale 's principle . thus , a neuron can be characterized by the neurotransmitters that it releases . the great majority of psychoactive drugs exert their effects by altering specific neurotransmitter systems . this applies to drugs such as cannabinoids , nicotine , heroin , cocaine , alcohol , fluoxetine , chlorpromazine , and many others .
in an ethnic sense , an ashkenazi jew is one whose ancestry can be traced to the jews who settled in central europe . for roughly a thousand years , the ashkenazim were a reproductively isolated population in europe , despite living in many countries , with little inflow or outflow from migration , conversion , or intermarriage with other groups , including other jews . human geneticists have argued that genetic variations have been identified that show high frequencies among ashkenazi jews , but not in the general european population , be they for patrilineal markers ( y-chromosome haplotypes ) and for matrilineal markers ( mitotypes ) . however , a 2013 study of ashkenazi mitochondrial dna , from the university of huddersfield in england , suggests that at least 80 percent of the ashkenazi maternal lineages derive from the assimilation of mtdnas indigenous to europe , probably as a consequence of conversion . since the middle of the 20th century , many ashkenazi jews have intermarried , both with members of other jewish communities and with people of other nations and faiths .
the university of the republic is the country 's largest and most important university , with a student body of 81,774 , according to the census of 2007 . it was founded on 18 july 1849 in montevideo , where most of its buildings and facilities are still located . its current rector is dr. rodrigo arocena . the university houses 14 faculties ( departments ) and various institutes and schools . many eminent uruguayans have graduated from this university , including carlos vaz ferreira , jose luis massera , gabriel paternain , mario wschebor , roman fresnedo siri , carlos ott and eladio dieste
of the approximately 850 municipalities of thuringia , 126 are classed as towns ( within a district ) or cities ( forming their own urban district ) . most of the towns are small with a population of less than 10,000 ; only the ten biggest ones have a population greater than 30,000 . the first towns emerged during the 12th century , whereas the latest ones received town status only in the 20th century . today , all municipalities within districts are equal in law , whether they are towns or villages . independent cities ( i.e. urban districts ) have greater powers ( the same as any district ) than towns within a district .
the turkish invasion , followed by occupation and the declaration of independence of the trnc have been condemned by united nations resolutions , which are reaffirmed by the security council every year . the last major effort to settle the cyprus dispute was the annan plan in 2004 , drafted by the then secretary general , kofi annan . the plan was put to a referendum in both northern cyprus and the republic of cyprus . 65 % of turkish cypriots voted in support of the plan and 74 % greek cypriots voted against the plan , claiming that it disproportionately favoured the turkish side . in total , 66.7 % of the voters rejected the annan plan v. on 1 may 2004 cyprus joined the european union , together with nine other countries . cyprus was accepted into the eu as a whole , although the eu legislation is suspended in the territory occupied by turkey ( trnc ) , until a final settlement of the cyprus problem . in july 2006 , the island served as a haven for people fleeing lebanon , due to the conflict between israel and hezbollah ( also called " the july war " ) .

race and ethnicity are considered separate and distinct identities , with hispanic or latino origin asked as a separate question . thus , in addition to their race or races , all respondents are categorized by membership in one of two ethnic categories , which are " hispanic or latino " and " not hispanic or latino . " however , the practice of separating " race " and " ethnicity " as different categories has been criticized both by the american anthropological association and members of u.s. commission on civil rights .
in china , urbanization increased as the population grew and as the division of labor grew more complex . large urban centers , such as nanjing and beijing , also contributed to the growth of private industry . in particular , small-scale industries grew up , often specializing in paper , silk , cotton , and porcelain goods . for the most part , however , relatively small urban centers with markets proliferated around the country . town markets mainly traded food , with some necessary manufactures such as pins or oil . despite the xenophobia and intellectual introspection characteristic of the increasingly popular new school of neo-confucianism , china under the early ming dynasty was not isolated . foreign trade and other contacts with the outside world , particularly japan , increased considerably . chinese merchants explored all of the indian ocean , reaching east africa with the treasure voyages of zheng he .
on 29 october 1956 , israeli forces crossed the sinai peninsula , overwhelmed egyptian army posts , and quickly advanced to their objectives . two days later , british and french planes bombarded egyptian airfields in the canal zone . nasser ordered the military 's high command to withdraw the egyptian army from sinai to bolster the canal 's defenses . moreover , he feared that if the armored corps was dispatched to confront the israeli invading force and the british and french subsequently landed in the canal city of port said , egyptian armor in the sinai would be cut off from the canal and destroyed by the combined tripartite forces . amer strongly disagreed , insisting that egyptian tanks meet the israelis in battle . the two had a heated exchange on 3 november , and amer conceded . nasser also ordered blockage of the canal by sinking or otherwise disabling forty-nine ships at its entrance .
at the beginning of the three kingdoms era ( 220-280 ce ) , zhejiang was home to the warlords yan baihu and wang lang prior to their defeat by sun ce and sun quan , who eventually established the kingdom of wu . despite the removal of their court from kuaiji to jianye ( present-day nanjing ) , they continued development of the region and benefitted from influxes of refugees fleeing the turmoil in northern china . industrial kilns were established and trade reached as far as manchuria and funan ( south vietnam ) .
president abraham lincoln visited general grant at petersburg on april 3 , and took a launch to richmond the next day , while jefferson davis attempted to organize his confederate government at danville . lincoln met confederate assistant secretary of war john a. campbell , and handed him a note inviting virginia 's legislature to end their rebellion . after campbell spun the note to confederate legislators as a possible end to the emancipation proclamation , lincoln rescinded his offer and ordered general weitzel to prevent the confederate state legislature from meeting . union forces killed , wounded or captured 8000 confederate troops at saylor 's creek southwest of petersburg on april 6 . general lee continued to reject general grant 's surrender suggestion until sheridan 's infantry and cavalry appeared in front of his retreating army on april 8 . he surrendered his remaining approximately 10000 troops at appomattox court house the following morning . jefferson davis retreated to north carolina , then further south. when lincoln rejected the surrender terms negotiated by general sherman and envoys of north carolina governor zebulon vance , which failed to mention slavery . davis was captured on may 10 near irwinville , georgia and taken back to virginia , where he was charged with treason and imprisoned for two years at fort monroe until freed on bail .
widowed in 1861 , the grief-stricken queen withdrew from public life and left buckingham palace to live at windsor castle , balmoral castle and osborne house . for many years the palace was seldom used , even neglected . in 1864 , a note was found pinned to the fence of buckingham palace , saying : " these commanding premises to be let or sold , in consequence of the late occupant 's declining business . " eventually , public opinion forced the queen to return to london , though even then she preferred to live elsewhere whenever possible . court functions were still held at windsor castle , presided over by the sombre queen habitually dressed in mourning black , while buckingham palace remained shuttered for most of the year .
the classical period of greek civilization covers a time spanning from the early 5th century bc to the death of alexander the great , in 323 bc ( some authors prefer to split this period into ' classical ' , from the end of the persian wars to the end of the peloponnesian war , and ' fourth century ' , up to the death of alexander ) . it is so named because it set the standards by which greek civilization would be judged in later eras . the classical period is also described as the " golden age " of greek civilization , and its art , philosophy , architecture and literature would be instrumental in the formation and development of western culture .
in 1965 , paul vi decided on the creation of a joint working group with the world council of churches to map all possible avenues of dialogue and cooperation . in the following three years , eight sessions were held which resulted in many joint proposals . it was proposed to work closely together in areas of social justice and development and third world issues such as hunger and poverty . on the religious side , it was agreed to share together in the week of prayer for christian unity , to be held every year . the joint working group was to prepare texts which were to be used by all christians . on 19 july 1968 , the meeting of the world council of churches took place in uppsala , sweden , which pope paul called a sign of the times . he sent his blessing in an ecumenical manner : " may the lord bless everything you do for the case of christian unity . " the world council of churches decided on including catholic theologians in its committees , provided they have the backing of the vatican .
the first semi-permanent inhabitants of regions near antarctica ( areas situated south of the antarctic convergence ) were british and american sealers who used to spend a year or more on south georgia , from 1786 onward . during the whaling era , which lasted until 1966 , the population of that island varied from over 1,000 in the summer ( over 2,000 in some years ) to some 200 in the winter . most of the whalers were norwegian , with an increasing proportion of britons . the settlements included grytviken , leith harbour , king edward point , stromness , husvik , prince olav harbour , ocean harbour and godthul . managers and other senior officers of the whaling stations often lived together with their families . among them was the founder of grytviken , captain carl anton larsen , a prominent norwegian whaler and explorer who , along with his family , adopted british citizenship in 1910 .
critics of the aeneid focus on a variety of issues . the tone of the poem as a whole is a particular matter of debate ; some see the poem as ultimately pessimistic and politically subversive to the augustan regime , while others view it as a celebration of the new imperial dynasty . virgil makes use of the symbolism of the augustan regime , and some scholars see strong associations between augustus and aeneas , the one as founder and the other as re-founder of rome . a strong teleology , or drive towards a climax , has been detected in the poem . the aeneid is full of prophecies about the future of rome , the deeds of augustus , his ancestors , and famous romans , and the carthaginian wars ; the shield of aeneas even depicts augustus ' victory at actium against mark antony and cleopatra vii in 31 bc . a further focus of study is the character of aeneas . as the protagonist of the poem , aeneas seems to waver constantly between his emotions and commitment to his prophetic duty to found rome ; critics note the breakdown of aeneas ' emotional control in the last sections of the poem where the " pious " and " righteous " aeneas mercilessly slaughters turnus .
during the last three decades of the 19th century a proliferation of anthropological societies and associations occurred , most independent , most publishing their own journals , and all international in membership and association . the major theorists belonged to these organizations . they supported the gradual osmosis of anthropology curricula into the major institutions of higher learning . by 1898 the american association for the advancement of science was able to report that 48 educational institutions in 13 countries had some curriculum in anthropology . none of the 75 faculty members were under a department named anthropology .
congress often enacts statutes that grant broad rulemaking authority to federal agencies . often , congress is simply too gridlocked to draft detailed statutes that explain how the agency should react to every possible situation , or congress believes the agency 's technical specialists are best equipped to deal with particular fact situations as they arise . therefore , federal agencies are authorized to promulgate regulations . under the principle of chevron deference , regulations normally carry the force of law as long as they are based on a reasonable interpretation of the relevant statutes .
richmond recovered quickly from the war , and by 1782 was once again a thriving city . in 1786 , the virginia statute for religious freedom ( drafted by thomas jefferson ) was passed at the temporary capitol in richmond , providing the basis for the separation of church and state , a key element in the development of the freedom of religion in the united states . a permanent home for the new government , the virginia state capitol building , was designed by thomas jefferson with the assistance of charles-louis clerisseau , and was completed in 1788 .
queen began their 1980s career with the game . it featured the singles " crazy little thing called love " and " another one bites the dust , " both of which reached number one in the us . after attending a queen concert in los angeles , michael jackson suggested to mercury backstage that " another one bites the dust " be released as a single , and in october 1980 it spent three weeks at number one . the album topped the billboard 200 for five weeks , and sold over four million copies in the us . it was also the first appearance of a synthesiser on a queen album . heretofore , their albums featured a distinctive " no synthesisers ! " sleeve note . the note is widely assumed to reflect an anti-synth , pro- " hard " -rock stance by the band , but was later revealed by producer roy thomas baker to be an attempt to clarify that those albums ' multi-layered solos were created with guitars , not synths , as record company executives kept assuming at the time . in september 1980 , queen performed three sold-out shows at madison square garden . in 1980 , queen also released the soundtrack they had recorded for flash gordon . at the 1981 american music awards in january , " another one bites the dust " won the award for favorite pop / rock single , and queen were nominated for favorite pop / rock band , duo , or group .
a vestal 's dress represented her status outside the usual categories that defined roman women , with elements of both virgin bride and daughter , and roman matron and wife . unlike male priests , vestals were freed of the traditional obligations of marrying and producing children , and were required to take a vow of chastity that was strictly enforced : a vestal polluted by the loss of her chastity while in office was buried alive . thus the exceptional honor accorded a vestal was religious rather than personal or social ; her privileges required her to be fully devoted to the performance of her duties , which were considered essential to the security of rome .
ascii developed from telegraphic codes . its first commercial use was as a seven-bit teleprinter code promoted by bell data services . work on the ascii standard began on october 6 , 1960 , with the first meeting of the american standards association 's ( asa ) x3.2 subcommittee . the first edition of the standard was published during 1963 , underwent a major revision during 1967 , and experienced its most recent update during 1986 . compared to earlier telegraph codes , the proposed bell code and ascii were both ordered for more convenient sorting ( i.e. , alphabetization ) of lists , and added features for devices other than teleprinters .
humbert is at the center of ascetic writers in the dominican order . in this role , he added significantly to its spirituality . his writings are permeated with " religious good sense , " and he used uncomplicated language that could edify even the weakest member . humbert advised his readers , " [ young dominicans ] are also to be instructed not to be eager to see visions or work miracles , since these avail little to salvation , and sometimes we are fooled by them ; but rather they should be eager to do good in which salvation consists . also , they should be taught not to be sad if they do not enjoy the divine consolations they hear others have ; but they should know the loving father for some reason sometimes withholds these . again , they should learn that if they lack the grace of compunction or devotion they should not think they are not in the state of grace as long as they have good will , which is all that god regards . "
in the early sumerian uruk period , the primitive pictograms suggest that sheep , goats , cattle , and pigs were domesticated . they used oxen as their primary beasts of burden and donkeys or equids as their primary transport animal and " woollen clothing as well as rugs were made from the wool or hair of the animals . ... by the side of the house was an enclosed garden planted with trees and other plants ; wheat and probably other cereals were sown in the fields , and the shaduf was already employed for the purpose of irrigation . plants were also grown in pots or vases . "
pressing the sheet removes the water by force ; once the water is forced from the sheet , a special kind of felt , which is not to be confused with the traditional one , is used to collect the water ; whereas when making paper by hand , a blotter sheet is used instead .
ibm also had their own dbms in 1966 , known as information management system ( ims ) . ims was a development of software written for the apollo program on the system / 360 . ims was generally similar in concept to codasyl , but used a strict hierarchy for its model of data navigation instead of codasyl 's network model . both concepts later became known as navigational databases due to the way data was accessed , and bachman 's 1973 turing award presentation was the programmer as navigator . ims is classified [ by whom ? ] as a hierarchical database . idms and cincom systems ' total database are classified as network databases . ims remains in use as of 2014 [ update ] .
people of ashkenazi descent constitute around 47.5 % of israeli jews ( and therefore 35-36 % of israelis ) . they have played a prominent role in the economy , media , and politics of israel since its founding . during the first decades of israel as a state , strong cultural conflict occurred between sephardic and ashkenazi jews ( mainly east european ashkenazim ) . the roots of this conflict , which still exists to a much smaller extent in present-day israeli society , are chiefly attributed to the concept of the " melting pot . " that is to say , all jewish immigrants who arrived in israel were strongly encouraged to " melt down " their own particular exilic identities within the general social " pot " in order to become israeli .

in 1821 , after mexico 's war of independence from spain , texas was part of the united mexican states as the state of coahuila y tejas . a large influx of americans soon followed , originally with the approval of mexico 's president . in 1836 , the now largely " american " texans , fought a war of independence from the central government of mexico and established the republic of texas . in 1846 , the republic dissolved when texas entered the united states of america as a state . per the 1850 u.s. census , fewer than 16,000 texans were of mexican descent , and nearly all were spanish-speaking people ( both mexicans and non-spanish european settlers who include german texan ) who were outnumbered ( six-to-one ) by english-speaking settlers ( both americans and other immigrant europeans ) .

a look at one minority leadership strategy - partisan opposition - may suggest why it might be employed in specific circumstances . the purposes of obstruction are several , such as frustrating the majority party 's ability to govern or attracting press and media attention to the alleged ineffectiveness of the majority party . " we know how to delay , " remarked minority leader gephardt dilatory motions to adjourn , appeals of the presiding officer 's ruling , or numerous requests for roll call votes are standard time-consuming parliamentary tactics . by stalling action on the majority party 's agenda , the minority leader may be able to launch a campaign against a " do-nothing congress " and convince enough voters to put his party back in charge of the house . to be sure , the minority leader recognizes that " going negative " carries risks and may not be a winning strategy if his party fails to offer policy alternatives that appeal to broad segments of the general public .
court presentations of aristocratic young ladies to the monarch took place at the palace from the reign of edward vii . these young women were known as debutantes , and the occasion - termed their " coming out " - represented their first entree into society . debutantes wore full court dress , with three tall ostrich feathers in their hair . they entered , curtsied , and performed a choreographed backwards walk and a further curtsy , while manoeuvring a dress train of prescribed length . ( the ceremony , known as an evening court , corresponded to the " court drawing rooms " of victoria 's reign . ) after world war ii , the ceremony was replaced by less formal afternoon receptions , usually without choreographed curtsies and court dress .
louis did not leave a son as heir after his death in 1382 . instead , he named as his heir the young prince sigismund of luxemburg , who was 11 years old . the hungarian nobility did not accept his claim , and the result was an internal war . sigismund eventually achieved total control of hungary and established his court in buda and visegrad . both palaces were rebuilt and improved , and were considered the richest of the time in europe . inheriting the throne of bohemia and the holy roman empire , sigismund continued conducting his politics from hungary , but he was kept busy fighting the hussites and the ottoman empire , which was becoming a menace to europe in the beginning of the 15th century .
the speed of mail traveling between guam and the states varies depending on size and time of year . light , first-class items generally take less than a week to or from the mainland , but larger first-class or priority items can take a week or two . fourth-class mail , such as magazines , are transported by sea after reaching hawaii . most residents use post office boxes or private mail boxes , although residential delivery is becoming increasingly available . incoming mail not from the americas should be addressed to " guam " instead of " usa " to avoid being routed the long way through the u.s. mainland and possibly charged a higher rate ( especially from asia ) .
in the mid 1970s , various american groups ( some with ties to downtown manhattan 's punk scene , including television and suicide ) had begun expanding on the vocabulary of punk music . midwestern groups such as pere ubu and devo drew inspiration from the region 's derelict industrial environments , employing conceptual art techniques , musique concrete and unconventional verbal styles that would presage the post-punk movement by several years . a variety of subsequent groups , including new york-based talking heads and boston-based mission of burma , combined elements of punk with art school sensibilities . in 1978 , the former band began a series of collaborations with british ambient pioneer and ex-roxy music member brian eno , experimenting with dada-influenced lyrical techniques , dance music , and african polyrhythms . san francisco 's vibrant post-punk scene was centered around such groups as chrome , the residents and tuxedomoon , who incorporated multimedia experimentation , film and ideas from antonin artaud 's theater of cruelty .
from the rigveda until the time of panini ( fourth century bce ) the development of the early vedic language can be observed in other vedic texts : the samaveda , yajurveda , atharvaveda , brahmanas , and upanishads . during this time , the prestige of the language , its use for sacred purposes , and the importance attached to its correct enunciation all served as powerful conservative forces resisting the normal processes of linguistic change . however , there is a clear , five-level linguistic development of vedic from the rigveda to the language of the upanishads and the earliest sutras such as the baudhayana sutras .
the council of ministers - under the presidency of the prime minister ( or the president of portugal at the latter 's request ) and the ministers ( may also include one or more deputy prime ministers ) - acts as the cabinet . each government is required to define the broad outline of its policies in a programme , and present it to the assembly for a mandatory period of debate . the failure of the assembly to reject the government programme by an absolute majority of deputies confirms the cabinet in office .
the battle of leyte gulf was arguably the largest naval battle in history and was the largest naval battle of world war ii . it was a series of four distinct engagements fought off the philippine island of leyte from 23 to 26 october 1944 . leyte gulf featured the largest battleships ever built , was the last time in history that battleships engaged each other , and was also notable as the first time that kamikaze aircraft were used . allied victory in the philippine sea established allied air and sea superiority in the western pacific . nimitz favored blockading the philippines and landing on formosa . this would give the allies control of the sea routes to japan from southern asia , cutting off substantial japanese garrisons . macarthur favored an invasion of the philippines , which also lay across the supply lines to japan . roosevelt adjudicated in favor of the philippines . meanwhile , japanese combined fleet chief toyoda soemu prepared four plans to cover all allied offensive scenarios . on 12 october nimitz launched a carrier raid against formosa to make sure that planes based there could not intervene in the landings on leyte . toyoda put plan sho-2 into effect , launching a series of air attacks against the u.s. carriers . however the japanese lost 600 planes in three days , leaving them without air cover .
apart from its use as a reactant , h2 has wide applications in physics and engineering . it is used as a shielding gas in welding methods such as atomic hydrogen welding . h2 is used as the rotor coolant in electrical generators at power stations , because it has the highest thermal conductivity of any gas . liquid h2 is used in cryogenic research , including superconductivity studies . because h2 is lighter than air , having a little more than 1 ⁄ 14 of the density of air , it was once widely used as a lifting gas in balloons and airships .
the offices of elder and ministerial servant were restored to witness congregations in 1972 , with appointments made from headquarters ( and later , also by branch committees ) . it was announced that , starting in september 2014 , appointments would be made by traveling overseers . in a major organizational overhaul in 1976 , the power of the watch tower society president was diminished , with authority for doctrinal and organizational decisions passed to the governing body . since knorr 's death in 1977 , the position of president has been occupied by frederick franz ( 1977-1992 ) and milton henschel ( 1992-2000 ) , both members of the governing body , and since 2000 by don a. adams , not a member of the governing body . in 1995 , jehovah 's witnesses abandoned the idea that armageddon must occur during the lives of the generation that was alive in 1914 and in 2013 changed their teaching on the " generation .

hyderabad emerged as the foremost centre of culture in india with the decline of the mughal empire . after the fall of delhi in 1857 , the migration of performing artists to the city particularly from the north and west of the indian sub continent , under the patronage of the nizam , enriched the cultural milieu . this migration resulted in a mingling of north and south indian languages , cultures and religions , which has since led to a co-existence of hindu and muslim traditions , for which the city has become noted . : viii a further consequence of this north-south mix is that both telugu and urdu are official languages of telangana . the mixing of religions has also resulted in many festivals being celebrated in hyderabad such as ganesh chaturthi , diwali and bonalu of hindu tradition and eid ul-fitr and eid al-adha by muslims .
the art of writing chinese characters is called chinese calligraphy . it is usually done with ink brushes . in ancient china , chinese calligraphy is one of the four arts of the chinese scholars . there is a minimalist set of rules of chinese calligraphy . every character from the chinese scripts is built into a uniform shape by means of assigning it a geometric area in which the character must occur . each character has a set number of brushstrokes ; none must be added or taken away from the character to enhance it visually , lest the meaning be lost . finally , strict regularity is not required , meaning the strokes may be accentuated for dramatic effect of individual style . calligraphy was the means by which scholars could mark their thoughts and teachings for immortality , and as such , represent some of the more precious treasures that can be found from ancient china .
carnivore and herbivore diets are contrasting , with basic nitrogen and carbon proportions vary for their particular foods . " the nitrogen content of plant tissues averages about 2 % , while in fungi , animals , and bacteria it averages about 5 % to 10 % . " many herbivores rely on bacterial fermentation to create digestible nutrients from indigestible plant cellulose , while obligate carnivores must eat animal meats to obtain certain vitamins or nutrients their bodies cannot otherwise synthesize . all animals ' diets must provide sufficient amounts of the basic building blocks they need , up to the point where their particular biology can synthesize the rest . animal tissue contains chemical compounds , such as water , carbohydrates ( sugar , starch , and fiber ) , amino acids ( in proteins ) , fatty acids ( in lipids ) , and nucleic acids ( dna and rna ) . these compounds in turn consist of elements such as carbon , hydrogen , oxygen , nitrogen , phosphorus , calcium , iron , zinc , magnesium , manganese , and so on . all of these chemical compounds and elements occur in various forms and combinations ( e.g. hormones , vitamins , phospholipids , hydroxyapatite ) .
the burnside rules closely resembling american football that were incorporated in 1903 by the orfu , was an effort to distinguish it from a more rugby-oriented game . the burnside rules had teams reduced to 12 men per side , introduced the snap-back system , required the offensive team to gain 10 yards on three downs , eliminated the throw-in from the sidelines , allowed only six men on the line , stated that all goals by kicking were to be worth two points and the opposition was to line up 10 yards from the defenders on all kicks . the rules were an attempt to standardize the rules throughout the country . the cirfu , qrfu and cru refused to adopt the new rules at first . forward passes were not allowed in the canadian game until 1929 , and touchdowns , which had been five points , were increased to six points in 1956 , in both cases several decades after the americans had adopted the same changes . the primary differences between the canadian and american games stem from rule changes that the american side of the border adopted but the canadian side did not ( originally , both sides had three downs , goal posts on the goal lines and unlimited forward motion , but the american side modified these rules and the canadians did not ) . the canadian field width was one rule that was not based on american rules , as the canadian game played in wider fields and stadiums that were not as narrow as the american stadiums .

chopin 's relations with sand were soured in 1846 by problems involving her daughter solange and solange 's fiance , the young fortune-hunting sculptor auguste clesinger . the composer frequently took solange 's side in quarrels with her mother ; he also faced jealousy from sand 's son maurice . chopin was utterly indifferent to sand 's radical political pursuits , while sand looked on his society friends with disdain . as the composer 's illness progressed , sand had become less of a lover and more of a nurse to chopin , whom she called her " third child . " in letters to third parties , she vented her impatience , referring to him as a " child , " a " little angel , " a " sufferer " and a " beloved little corpse . " in 1847 sand published her novel lucrezia floriani , whose main characters - a rich actress and a prince in weak health - could be interpreted as sand and chopin ; the story was uncomplimentary to chopin , who could not have missed the allusions as he helped sand correct the printer 's galleys . in 1847 he did not visit nohant , and he quietly ended their ten-year relationship following an angry correspondence which , in sand 's words , made " a strange conclusion to nine years of exclusive friendship . " the two would never meet again .
muammar muhammad abu minyar al-gaddafi ( arabic : معمر محمد ابو منيار القذافي arabic pronunciation : [ muʕamar al.qaðaːfiː ] ; / ˈmoʊ.əmɑːr ɡəˈdɑːfi / ; audio ( help · info ) ; c . 1942 - 20 october 2011 ) , commonly known as colonel gaddafi , [ b ] was a libyan revolutionary , politician , and political theorist . he governed libya as revolutionary chairman of the libyan arab republic from 1969 to 1977 and then as the " brotherly leader " of the great socialist people 's libyan arab jamahiriya from 1977 to 2011 . initially ideologically committed to arab nationalism and arab socialism , he came to rule according to his own third international theory before embracing pan-africanism and serving as chairperson of the african union from 2009 to 2010 .
as the grand duchy of finland was part of the russian empire from 1809 to 1918 , a number of russian speakers have remained in finland . there are 33,400 russian-speaking finns , amounting to 0.6 % of the population . five thousand ( 0.1 % ) of them are late 19th century and 20th century immigrants or their descendants , and the remaining majority are recent immigrants who moved there in the 1990s and later . [ citation needed ] russian is spoken by 1.4 % of the population of finland according to a 2014 estimate from the world factbook .
dna samples from 1228 russians show that the y chromosomes analyzed , all except 20 ( 1.6 % ) fall into seven major haplogroups all characteristic to west eurasian populations . taken together , they account for 95 % of the total russian y chromosomal pool . only ( 0.7 % ) fell into haplogroups that are specific to east and south asian populations . mitochondrial dna ( mtdna ) examined in poles and russians revealed the presence of all major european haplogroups , which were characterized by similar patterns of distribution in poles and russians . an analysis of the dna did not reveal any specific combinations of unique mtdna haplotypes and their subclusters . the dna clearly shows that both poles and russians are not different from the neighbouring european populations .
it is best for the receiving antenna to match the polarization of the transmitted wave for optimum reception . intermediate matchings will lose some signal strength , but not as much as a complete mismatch . a circularly polarized antenna can be used to equally well match vertical or horizontal linear polarizations . transmission from a circularly polarized antenna received by a linearly polarized antenna ( or vice versa ) entails a 3 db reduction in signal-to-noise ratio as the received power has thereby been cut in half .
after the great fire of rome in 64 ad , emperor nero accused the christians as convenient scapegoats , who were later persecuted and killed . from that point on , roman official policy towards christianity tended towards persecution . during the various imperial crises of the 3rd century , " contemporaries were predisposed to decode any crisis in religious terms , " regardless of their allegiance to particular practices or belief systems . christianity drew its traditional base of support from the powerless , who seemed to have no religious stake in the well-being of the roman state , and therefore threatened its existence . the majority of rome 's elite continued to observe various forms of inclusive hellenistic monism ; neoplatonism in particular accommodated the miraculous and the ascetic within a traditional graeco-roman cultic framework . christians saw these ungodly practices as a primary cause of economic and political crisis .
" new labour " was first termed as an alternative branding for the labour party , dating from a conference slogan first used by the labour party in 1994 , which was later seen in a draft manifesto published by the party in 1996 , called new labour , new life for britain . it was a continuation of the trend that had begun under the leadership of neil kinnock . " new labour " as a name has no official status , but remains in common use to distinguish modernisers from those holding to more traditional positions , normally referred to as " old labour . "
in 1897 , frank shuman , a u.s. inventor , engineer and solar energy pioneer built a small demonstration solar engine that worked by reflecting solar energy onto square boxes filled with ether , which has a lower boiling point than water , and were fitted internally with black pipes which in turn powered a steam engine . in 1908 shuman formed the sun power company with the intent of building larger solar power plants . he , along with his technical advisor a.s.e. ackermann and british physicist sir charles vernon boys , developed an improved system using mirrors to reflect solar energy upon collector boxes , increasing heating capacity to the extent that water could now be used instead of ether . shuman then constructed a full-scale steam engine powered by low-pressure water , enabling him to patent the entire solar engine system by 1912 .
in the early 21st century , republican voters control most of the state , especially in the more rural and suburban areas outside of the cities ; democratic strength is mostly confined to the urban cores of the four major cities , and is particularly strong in the cities of nashville and memphis . the latter area includes a large african-american population . historically , republicans had their greatest strength in east tennessee before the 1960s . tennessee 's 1st and 2nd congressional districts , based in the tri-cities and knoxville , respectively , are among the few historically republican districts in the south . those districts ' residents supported the union over the confederacy during the civil war ; they identified with the gop after the war and have stayed with that party ever since . the 1st has been in republican hands continuously since 1881 , and republicans ( or their antecedents ) have held it for all but four years since 1859 . the 2nd has been held continuously by republicans or their antecedents since 1859 .
the democratic party holds the majority of public offices . as of november 2008 , 67 % of registered voters in the city are democrats . new york city has not been carried by a republican in a statewide or presidential election since president calvin coolidge won the five boroughs in 1924 . in 2012 , democrat barack obama became the first presidential candidate of any party to receive more than 80 % of the overall vote in new york city , sweeping all five boroughs . party platforms center on affordable housing , education , and economic development , and labor politics are of importance in the city .
due to the patriarchal nature of arab society , arab men , including during the slave trade in north africa , enslaved more black women than men . they used more black female slaves in domestic service and agriculture than males . the men interpreted the qur 'an to permit sexual relations between a male master and his female slave outside of marriage ( see ma malakat aymanukum and sex ) , leading to many mixed-race children . when an enslaved woman became pregnant with her arab master 's child , she was considered as umm walad or " mother of a child , " a status that granted her privileged rights . the child was given rights of inheritance to the father 's property , so mixed-race children could share in any wealth of the father . because the society was patrilineal , the children took their fathers ' social status at birth and were born free .
the record transfer fee for a premier league player has risen steadily over the lifetime of the competition . prior to the start of the first premier league season alan shearer became the first british player to command a transfer fee of more than £ 3 million . the record rose steadily in the premier league 's first few seasons , until alan shearer made a record breaking £ 15 million move to newcastle united in 1996 . the three highest transfer in the sport 's history had a premier league club on the selling end , with tottenham hotspur selling gareth bale to real madrid for £ 85 million in 2013 , manchester united 's sale of cristiano ronaldo to real madrid for £ 80 million in 2009 , and liverpool selling luis suarez to barcelona for £ 75 million in 2014 .
known during development as xbox next , xenon , xbox 2 , xbox fs or nextbox , the xbox 360 was conceived in early 2003 . in february 2003 , planning for the xenon software platform began , and was headed by microsoft 's vice president j allard . that month , microsoft held an event for 400 developers in bellevue , washington to recruit support for the system . also that month , peter moore , former president of sega of america , joined microsoft . on august 12 , 2003 , ati signed on to produce the graphic processing unit for the new console , a deal which was publicly announced two days later . before the launch of the xbox 360 , several alpha development kits were spotted using apple 's power mac g5 hardware . this was because the system 's powerpc 970 processor running the same powerpc architecture that the xbox 360 would eventually run under ibm 's xenon processor . the cores of the xenon processor were developed using a slightly modified version of the playstation 3 's cell processor ppe architecture . according to david shippy and mickie phipps , the ibm employees were " hiding " their work from sony and toshiba , ibm 's partners in developing the cell processor . jeff minter created the music visualization program neon which is included with the xbox 360 .
the thalidomide tragedy resurrected kefauver 's bill to enhance drug regulation that had stalled in congress , and the kefauver-harris amendment became law on 10 october 1962 . manufacturers henceforth had to prove to fda that their drugs were effective as well as safe before they could go on the us market . the fda received authority to regulate advertising of prescription drugs and to establish good manufacturing practices . the law required that all drugs introduced between 1938 and 1962 had to be effective . an fda - national academy of sciences collaborative study showed that nearly 40 percent of these products were not effective . a similarly comprehensive study of over-the-counter products began ten years later .
as the playing of gramophone records causes gradual degradation of the recording , they are best preserved by transferring them onto other media and playing the records as rarely as possible . they need to be stored on edge , and do best under environmental conditions that most humans would find comfortable . the medium needs to be kept clean , but alcohol should only be used on pvc or optical media , not on 78s . [ citation needed ] the equipment for playback of certain formats ( e.g. , 16 and 78 rpm ) is manufactured only in small quantities , leading to increased difficulty in finding equipment to play the recordings .
because of the low elevation , the islands that make up this nation are vulnerable to the effects of tropical cyclones and by the threat of current and future sea level rise . the highest elevation is 4.6 metres ( 15 ft ) above sea level on niulakita , which gives tuvalu the second-lowest maximum elevation of any country ( after the maldives ) . the highest elevations are typically in narrow storm dunes on the ocean side of the islands which are prone to overtopping in tropical cyclones , as occurred with cyclone bebe , which was a very early-season storm that passed through the tuvaluan atolls in october 1972 . cyclone bebe submerged funafuti , eliminating 90 % of structures on the island . sources of drinking water were contaminated as a result of the system 's storm surge and the flooding of the sources of fresh water .
on 11 march 1978 , a plo guerilla raid from lebanon led to the coastal road massacre . israel responded by launching an invasion of southern lebanon to destroy the plo bases south of the litani river . most plo fighters withdrew , but israel was able to secure southern lebanon until a un force and the lebanese army could take over . the plo soon resumed its policy of attacks against israel . in the next few years , the plo infiltrated the south and kept up a sporadic shelling across the border . israel carried out numerous retaliatory attacks by air and on the ground .
the settlements at tilsit gave napoleon time to organize his empire . one of his major objectives became enforcing the continental system against the british . he decided to focus his attention on the kingdom of portugal , which consistently violated his trade prohibitions . after defeat in the war of the oranges in 1801 , portugal adopted a double-sided policy . at first , john vi agreed to close his ports to british trade . the situation changed dramatically after the franco-spanish defeat at trafalgar ; john grew bolder and officially resumed diplomatic and trade relations with britain .
when the alloy cools and solidifies ( crystallizes ) , its mechanical properties will often be quite different from those of its individual constituents . a metal that is normally very soft and malleable , such as aluminium , can be altered by alloying it with another soft metal , like copper . although both metals are very soft and ductile , the resulting aluminium alloy will be much harder and stronger . adding a small amount of non-metallic carbon to iron produces an alloy called steel . due to its very-high strength and toughness ( which is much higher than pure iron ) , and its ability to be greatly altered by heat treatment , steel is one of the most common alloys in modern use . by adding chromium to steel , its resistance to corrosion can be enhanced , creating stainless steel , while adding silicon will alter its electrical characteristics , producing silicon steel .

as of 2007 , the total installed capacity of solar hot water systems is approximately 154 thermal gigawatt ( gwth ) . china is the world leader in their deployment with 70 gwth installed as of 2006 and a long-term goal of 210 gwth by 2020 . israel and cyprus are the per capita leaders in the use of solar hot water systems with over 90 % of homes using them . in the united states , canada and australia heating swimming pools is the dominant application of solar hot water with an installed capacity of 18 gwth as of 2005 .
although the city lost the status of state capital to columbia in 1786 , charleston became even more prosperous in the plantation-dominated economy of the post-revolutionary years . the invention of the cotton gin in 1793 revolutionized the processing of this crop , making short-staple cotton profitable . it was more easily grown in the upland areas , and cotton quickly became south carolina 's major export commodity . the piedmont region was developed into cotton plantations , to which the sea islands and lowcountry were already devoted . slaves were also the primary labor force within the city , working as domestics , artisans , market workers , and laborers .
roads in the us have been paved with materials that include asphalt / bitumen since at least 1870 , when a street in front of the newark , nj city hall was paved . in many cases , these early pavings were made from naturally occurring " bituminous rock , " such as at ritchie mines in macfarlan in ritchie county , west virginia from 1852 to 1873 . in 1876 , asphalt-based paving was used to pave pennsylvania avenue in washington , dc , in time for the celebration of the national centennial . asphalt / bitumen was also used for flooring , paving and waterproofing of baths and swimming pools during the early 20th century , following similar trends in europe .
at the age of 21 he settled in paris . thereafter , during the last 18 years of his life , he gave only some 30 public performances , preferring the more intimate atmosphere of the salon . he supported himself by selling his compositions and teaching piano , for which he was in high demand . chopin formed a friendship with franz liszt and was admired by many of his musical contemporaries , including robert schumann . in 1835 he obtained french citizenship . after a failed engagement to maria wodzinska , from 1837 to 1847 he maintained an often troubled relationship with the french writer george sand . a brief and unhappy visit to majorca with sand in 1838-39 was one of his most productive periods of composition . in his last years , he was financially supported by his admirer jane stirling , who also arranged for him to visit scotland in 1848 . through most of his life , chopin suffered from poor health . he died in paris in 1849 , probably of tuberculosis .

in most taxonomies , the flowering plants are treated as a coherent group . the most popular descriptive name has been angiospermae ( angiosperms ) , with anthophyta ( " flowering plants " ) a second choice . these names are not linked to any rank . the wettstein system and the engler system use the name angiospermae , at the assigned rank of subdivision . the reveal system treated flowering plants as subdivision magnoliophytina ( frohne & u. jensen ex reveal , phytologia 79 : 70 1996 ) , but later split it to magnoliopsida , liliopsida , and rosopsida . the takhtajan system and cronquist system treat this group at the rank of division , leading to the name magnoliophyta ( from the family name magnoliaceae ) . the dahlgren system and thorne system ( 1992 ) treat this group at the rank of class , leading to the name magnoliopsida . the apg system of 1998 , and the later 2003 and 2009 revisions , treat the flowering plants as a clade called angiosperms without a formal botanical name . however , a formal classification was published alongside the 2009 revision in which the flowering plants form the subclass magnoliidae .
the spectrum emitted by a blackbody radiator at temperatures of incandescent bulbs does not match the sensitivity characteristics of the human eye ; the light emitted does not appear white , and most is not in the range of wavelengths at which the eye is most sensitive . tungsten filaments radiate mostly infrared radiation at temperatures where they remain solid - below 3,695 k ( 3,422 ° c ; 6,191 ° f ) . donald l. klipstein explains it this way : " an ideal thermal radiator produces visible light most efficiently at temperatures around 6,300 ° c ( 6,600 k ; 11,400 ° f ) . even at this high temperature , a lot of the radiation is either infrared or ultraviolet , and the theoretical luminous efficacy ( ler ) is 95 lumens per watt . " no known material can be used as a filament at this ideal temperature , which is hotter than the sun 's surface . an upper limit for incandescent lamp luminous efficacy ( ler ) is around 52 lumens per watt , the theoretical value emitted by tungsten at its melting point .
the pashupatinath temple is a famous 5th century hindu temple dedicated to lord shiva ( pashupati ) . located on the banks of the bagmati river in the eastern part of kathmandu , pashupatinath temple is the oldest hindu temple in kathmandu . it served as the seat of national deity , lord pashupatinath , until nepal was secularized . however , a significant part of the temple was destroyed by mughal invaders in the 14th century and little or nothing remains of the original 5th-century temple exterior . the temple as it stands today was built in the 19th century , although the image of the bull and the black four-headed image of pashupati are at least 300 years old . the temple is a unesco world heritage site . shivaratri , or the night of lord shiva , is the most important festival that takes place here , attracting thousands of devotees and sadhus .

however , closing times were increasingly disregarded in the country pubs . in england and wales by 2000 pubs could legally open from 11 am ( 12 noon on sundays ) through to 11 pm ( 10 : 30 pm on sundays ) . that year was also the first to allow continuous opening for 36 hours from 11 am on new year 's eve to 11 pm on new year 's day . in addition , many cities had by-laws to allow some pubs to extend opening hours to midnight or 1 am , whilst nightclubs had long been granted late licences to serve alcohol into the morning . pubs near london 's smithfield market , billingsgate fish market and covent garden fruit and flower market could stay open 24 hours a day since victorian times to provide a service to the shift working employees of the markets .
during his tour on the guided missile frigate uss gridley , kerry requested duty in south vietnam , listing as his first preference a position as the commander of a fast patrol craft ( pcf ) , also known as a " swift boat . " these 50-foot ( 15 m ) boats have aluminum hulls and have little or no armor , but are heavily armed and rely on speed . " i didn 't really want to get involved in the war , " kerry said in a book of vietnam reminiscences published in 1986 . " when i signed up for the swift boats , they had very little to do with the war . they were engaged in coastal patrolling and that 's what i thought i was going to be doing . " however , his second choice of billet was on a river patrol boat , or " pbr , " which at the time was serving a more dangerous duty on the rivers of vietnam .
seattle 's political culture is very liberal and progressive for the united states , with over 80 % of the population voting for the democratic party . all precincts in seattle voted for democratic party candidate barack obama in the 2012 presidential election . in partisan elections for the washington state legislature and united states congress , nearly all elections are won by democrats . seattle is considered the first major american city to elect a female mayor , bertha knight landes . it has also elected an openly gay mayor , ed murray , and a socialist councillor , kshama sawant . for the first time in united states history , an openly gay black woman was elected to public office when sherry harris was elected as a seattle city councillor in 1991 . the majority of the current city council is female , while white men comprise a minority .
higher education , also called tertiary , third stage , or postsecondary education , is the non-compulsory educational level that follows the completion of a school such as a high school or secondary school . tertiary education is normally taken to include undergraduate and postgraduate education , as well as vocational education and training . colleges and universities mainly provide tertiary education . collectively , these are sometimes known as tertiary institutions . individuals who complete tertiary education generally receive certificates , diplomas , or academic degrees .
after many other more or less successful attempts with relatively weak rotating and reciprocating apparatus the prussian moritz von jacobi created the first real rotating electric motor in may 1834 that actually developed a remarkable mechanical output power . his motor set a world record which was improved only four years later in september 1838 by jacobi himself . his second motor was powerful enough to drive a boat with 14 people across a wide river . it was not until 1839 / 40 that other developers worldwide managed to build motors of similar and later also of higher performance .

oklahoma city has a very active severe weather season from march through june , especially during april and may . being in the center of what is colloquially referred to as tornado alley , it is prone to especially frequent and severe tornadoes , as well as very severe hailstorms and occasional derechoes . tornadoes have occurred in every month of the year and a secondary smaller peak also occurs during autumn , especially october . the oklahoma city metropolitan area is one of the most tornado-prone major cities in the world , with about 150 tornadoes striking within the city limits since 1890 . since the time weather records have been kept , oklahoma city has been struck by thirteen violent tornadoes , eleven f / ef4s and two f / ef5 . on may 3 , 1999 parts of southern oklahoma city and nearby suburban communities suffered from one of the most powerful tornadoes on record , an f5 on the fujita scale , with wind speeds estimated by radar at 318 mph ( 510 km / h ) . on may 20 , 2013 , far southwest oklahoma city , along with newcastle and moore , was hit again by a ef5 tornado ; it was 0.5 to 1.3 miles ( 0.80 to 2.09 km ) wide and killed 23 people . less than two weeks later , on may 31 , another outbreak affected the oklahoma city area , including an ef1 and an ef0 within the city and a tornado several miles west of the city that was 2.6 miles ( 4.2 km ) in width , the widest tornado ever recorded .
in 1654 , otto von guericke invented the first vacuum pump and conducted his famous magdeburg hemispheres experiment , showing that teams of horses could not separate two hemispheres from which the air had been partially evacuated . robert boyle improved guericke 's design and with the help of robert hooke further developed vacuum pump technology . thereafter , research into the partial vacuum lapsed until 1850 when august toepler invented the toepler pump and heinrich geissler invented the mercury displacement pump in 1855 , achieving a partial vacuum of about 10 pa ( 0.1 torr ) . a number of electrical properties become observable at this vacuum level , which renewed interest in further research .
islam arrived 1,400 years ago in zhejiang . today islam is practiced by a small number of people including virtually all the hui chinese living in zhejiang . another religion present in the province is she shamanism ( practiced by she ethnic minority ) .
808s & heartbreak , which features extensive use of the eponymous roland tr-808 drum machine and contains themes of love , loneliness , and heartache , was released by island def jam to capitalize on thanksgiving weekend in november 2008 . reviews were positive , though slightly more mixed than his previous efforts . despite this , the record 's singles demonstrated outstanding chart performances . upon its release , the lead single " love lockdown " debuted at number three on the billboard hot 100 and became a " hot shot debut , " while follow-up single " heartless " performed similarly and became his second consecutive " hot shot debut " by debuting at number four on the billboard hot 100 . while it was criticized prior to release , 808s & heartbreak had a significant effect on hip-hop music , encouraging other rappers to take more creative risks with their productions .
another effective way to decrease the transmission rate of infectious diseases is to recognize the effects of small-world networks . in epidemics , there are often extensive interactions within hubs or groups of infected individuals and other interactions within discrete hubs of susceptible individuals . despite the low interaction between discrete hubs , the disease can jump to and spread in a susceptible hub via a single or few interactions with an infected hub . thus , infection rates in small-world networks can be reduced somewhat if interactions between individuals within infected hubs are eliminated ( figure 1 ) . however , infection rates can be drastically reduced if the main focus is on the prevention of transmission jumps between hubs . the use of needle exchange programs in areas with a high density of drug users with hiv is an example of the successful implementation of this treatment method . another example is the use of ring culling or vaccination of potentially susceptible livestock in adjacent farms to prevent the spread of the foot-and-mouth virus in 2001 .
the lower ( triassic ) boundary is set by the permian-triassic extinction event , during which approximately 90 % to 96 % of marine species and 70 % of terrestrial vertebrates became extinct . it is also known as the " great dying " because it is considered the largest mass extinction in the earth 's history . the upper ( cretaceous ) boundary is set at the cretaceous-tertiary ( kt ) extinction event ( now more accurately called the cretaceous-paleogene ( or k-pg ) extinction event ) , which may have been caused by the impactor that created chicxulub crater on the yucatan peninsula . towards the late cretaceous large volcanic eruptions are also believed to have contributed to the cretaceous-paleogene extinction event . approximately 50 % of all genera became extinct , including all of the non-avian dinosaurs .
cold or oxygen-rich atmospheres can sustain life at pressures much lower than atmospheric , as long as the density of oxygen is similar to that of standard sea-level atmosphere . the colder air temperatures found at altitudes of up to 3 km generally compensate for the lower pressures there . above this altitude , oxygen enrichment is necessary to prevent altitude sickness in humans that did not undergo prior acclimatization , and spacesuits are necessary to prevent ebullism above 19 km . most spacesuits use only 20 kpa ( 150 torr ) of pure oxygen . this pressure is high enough to prevent ebullism , but decompression sickness and gas embolisms can still occur if decompression rates are not managed .
vladimir had been prince of novgorod when his father sviatoslav i died in 972 . he was forced to flee to scandinavia in 976 after his half-brother yaropolk had murdered his other brother oleg and taken control of rus . in scandinavia , with the help of his relative earl hakon sigurdsson , ruler of norway , vladimir assembled a viking army and reconquered novgorod and kiev from yaropolk . as prince of kiev , vladimir 's most notable achievement was the christianization of kievan rus ' , a process that began in 988 . the primary chronicle states that when vladimir had decided to accept a new faith instead of the traditional idol-worship ( paganism ) of the slavs , he sent out some of his most valued advisors and warriors as emissaries to different parts of europe . they visited the christians of the latin rite , the jews , and the muslims before finally arriving in constantinople . they rejected islam because , among other things , it prohibited the consumption of alcohol , and judaism because the god of the jews had permitted his chosen people to be deprived of their country . they found the ceremonies in the roman church to be dull . but at constantinople , they were so astounded by the beauty of the cathedral of hagia sophia and the liturgical service held there that they made up their minds there and then about the faith they would like to follow . upon their arrival home , they convinced vladimir that the faith of the byzantine rite was the best choice of all , upon which vladimir made a journey to constantinople and arranged to marry princess anna , the sister of byzantine emperor basil ii .
louis ' advisors believed that , as long as strasbourg remained independent , it would endanger the king 's newly annexed territories in alsace , and , that to defend these large rural lands effectively , a garrison had to be placed in towns such as strasbourg . indeed , the bridge over the rhine at strasbourg had been used repeatedly by imperial ( holy roman empire ) forces , and three times during the franco-dutch war strasbourg had served as a gateway for imperial invasions into alsace . in september 1681 louis ' forces , though lacking a clear casus belli , surrounded the city with overwhelming force . after some negotiation , louis marched into the city unopposed on 30 september 1681 and proclaimed its annexation .
in 1937 , the empire of japan started a full-scale invasion of china after invading manchuria in 1931 , beginning the second sino-japanese war ( often considered a theatre of world war ii ) . their troops occupied nanjing in december and carried out the systematic and brutal nanking massacre ( the " rape of nanking " ) . even children , the elderly , and nuns are reported to have suffered at the hands of the imperial japanese army . the total death toll , including estimates made by the international military tribunal for the far east and the nanjing war crimes tribunal , was between 300,000 and 350,000 . the city itself was also severely damaged during the massacre . the nanjing massacre memorial hall was built in 1985 to commemorate this event .
according to the u.s. census bureau , as of 2015 , tennessee had an estimated population of 6,600,299 , which is an increase of 50,947 , from the prior year and an increase of 254,194 , or 4.01 % , since the year 2010 . this includes a natural increase since the last census of 142,266 people ( that is 493,881 births minus 351,615 deaths ) , and an increase from net migration of 219,551 people into the state . immigration from outside the united states resulted in a net increase of 59,385 people , and migration within the country produced a net increase of 160,166 people . twenty percent of tennesseans were born outside the south in 2008 , compared to a figure of 13.5 % in 1990 .
while slaveholding was slightly less concentrated than in some southern states , according to the 1860 census , more than 330,000 people , or 33 % of the population of 992,622 , were enslaved african americans . they lived and worked chiefly on plantations in the eastern tidewater . in addition , 30,463 free people of color lived in the state . they were also concentrated in the eastern coastal plain , especially at port cities such as wilmington and new bern , where a variety of jobs were available . free african americans were allowed to vote until 1835 , when the state revoked their suffrage in restrictions following the slave rebellion of 1831 led by nat turner . southern slave codes criminalized willful killing of a slave in most cases .
in 1870 , republican sentiment in britain , fed by the queen 's seclusion , was boosted after the establishment of the third french republic . a republican rally in trafalgar square demanded victoria 's removal , and radical mps spoke against her . in august and september 1871 , she was seriously ill with an abscess in her arm , which joseph lister successfully lanced and treated with his new antiseptic carbolic acid spray . in late november 1871 , at the height of the republican movement , the prince of wales contracted typhoid fever , the disease that was believed to have killed his father , and victoria was fearful her son would die . as the tenth anniversary of her husband 's death approached , her son 's condition grew no better , and victoria 's distress continued . to general rejoicing , he pulled through . mother and son attended a public parade through london and a grand service of thanksgiving in st paul 's cathedral on 27 february 1872 , and republican feeling subsided .
a weather phenomenon known as the fohn ( with an identical effect to the chinook wind ) can occur at all times of the year and is characterised by an unexpectedly warm wind , bringing air of very low relative humidity to the north of the alps during rainfall periods on the southern face of the alps . this works both ways across the alps but is more efficient if blowing from the south due to the steeper step for oncoming wind from the south . valleys running south to north trigger the best effect . the driest conditions persist in all inner alpine valleys that receive less rain because arriving clouds lose a lot of their content while crossing the mountains before reaching these areas . large alpine areas such as graubunden remain drier than pre-alpine areas and as in the main valley of the valais wine grapes are grown there .
philips ' preferred name for the format was " vlp , " after the dutch words video langspeel-plaat ( " video long-play disc " ) , which in english-speaking countries stood for video long-play . the first consumer player , the magnavox vh-8000 even had the vlp logo on the player . for a while in the early and mid-1970s , philips also discussed a compatible audio-only format they called " alp , " but that was soon dropped as the compact disc system became a non-compatible project in the philips corporation . until early 1980 , the format had no " official " name . the laservision association , made up of mca , universal-pioneer , ibm , and philips / magnavox , was formed to standardize the technical specifications of the format ( which had been causing problems for the consumer market ) and finally named the system officially as " laservision . "
the specifics of paleo-indian migration to and throughout the americas , including the exact dates and routes traveled , provide the subject of ongoing research and discussion . according to archaeological and genetic evidence , north and south america were the last continents in the world with human habitation . during the wisconsin glaciation , 50-17,000 years ago , falling sea levels allowed people to move across the land bridge of beringia that joined siberia to north west north america ( alaska ) . alaska was a glacial refugia because it had low snowfall , allowing a small population to exist . the laurentide ice sheet covered most of north america , blocking nomadic inhabitants and confining them to alaska ( east beringia ) for thousands of years .
strasbourg , well known as centre of humanism , has a long history of excellence in higher-education , at the crossroads of french and german intellectual traditions . although strasbourg had been annexed by the kingdom of france in 1683 , it still remained connected to the german-speaking intellectual world throughout the 18th century and the university attracted numerous students from the holy roman empire , including goethe , metternich and montgelas , who studied law in strasbourg , among the most prominent . nowadays , strasbourg is known to offer among the best university courses in france , after paris .
antigonus then sent his son demetrius to regain control of greece . in 307 he took athens , expelling demetrius of phaleron , cassander 's governor , and proclaiming the city free again . demetrius now turned his attention to ptolemy , defeating his fleet at the battle of salamis and taking control of cyprus . in the aftermath of this victory , antigonus took the title of king ( basileus ) and bestowed it on his son demetrius poliorcetes , the rest of the diadochi soon followed suit . demetrius continued his campaigns by laying siege to rhodes and conquering most of greece in 302 , creating a league against cassander 's macedon .
in the 2010s , american jurisdictions have experienced a shortage of lethal injection drugs , due to anti-death penalty advocacy and low production volume . hospira , the only u.s. manufacturer of sodium thiopental , stopped making the drug in 2011 . the european union has outlawed the export of any product that could be used in an execution ; this has prevented executioners from using eu-manufactured anesthetics like propofol which are needed for general medical purposes . another alternative , pentobarbital , is also only manufactured in the european union , which has caused the danish producer to restrict distribution to u.s. government customers .
seattle in this period attracted widespread attention as home to these many companies , but also by hosting the 1990 goodwill games and the apec leaders conference in 1993 , as well as through the worldwide popularity of grunge , a sound that had developed in seattle 's independent music scene . another bid for worldwide attention - hosting the world trade organization ministerial conference of 1999 - garnered visibility , but not in the way its sponsors desired , as related protest activity and police reactions to those protests overshadowed the conference itself . the city was further shaken by the mardi gras riots in 2001 , and then literally shaken the following day by the nisqually earthquake .
like other newly independent states of the former soviet union , armenia 's economy suffers from the breakdown of former soviet trading patterns . soviet investment in and support of armenian industry has virtually disappeared , so that few major enterprises are still able to function . in addition , the effects of the 1988 spitak earthquake , which killed more than 25,000 people and made 500,000 homeless , are still being felt . the conflict with azerbaijan over nagorno-karabakh has not been resolved . the closure of azerbaijani and turkish borders has devastated the economy , because armenia depends on outside supplies of energy and most raw materials . land routes through georgia and iran are inadequate or unreliable . the gdp fell nearly 60 % between 1989 and 1993 , but then resumed robust growth . the national currency , the dram , suffered hyperinflation for the first years after its introduction in 1993 .
the first telephone lines were installed in 1882 and electric street lights took the place of the gas operated ones in 1886 . the hipodromo de maronas started operating in 1888 , and the neighbourhoods of reus del sur , reus del norte and conciliacion were inaugurated in 1889 . the new building of the school of arts and trades , as well as zabala square in ciudad vieja were inaugurated in 1890 , followed by the italian hospital in 1891 . in the same year , the village of penarol was founded . other neighbourhoods that were founded were belgrano and belvedere in 1892 , jacinto vera in 1895 and trouville in 1897 . in 1894 the new port was constructed , and in 1897 , the central railway station of montevideo was inaugurated .
liverpool produced a number of nationally and internationally successful popular singers in the 1950s , including traditional pop stars frankie vaughan and lita roza , and one of the most successful british rock and roll stars in billy fury . many lancashire towns had vibrant skiffle scenes in the late 1950s , out of which by the early 1960s a flourishing culture of beat groups began to emerge , particularly around liverpool and manchester . it has been estimated that there were around 350 bands active in and around liverpool in this era , often playing ballrooms , concert halls and clubs , among them the beatles . after their national success from 1962 , a number of liverpool performers were able to follow them into the charts , including gerry & the pacemakers , the searchers and cilla black . the first act to break through in the uk who were not from liverpool , or managed by brian epstein , were freddie and the dreamers , who were based in manchester , as were herman 's hermits and the hollies . led by the beatles , beat groups from the region spearheaded the british invasion of the us , which made a major contribution to the development of rock music . after the decline of beat groups in the late 1960s the centre of rock culture shifted to london and there were relatively few local bands who achieved national prominence until the growth of a disco funk scene and the punk rock revolution in the mid and late 1970s .
melbourne 's live performance institutions date from the foundation of the city , with the first theatre , the pavilion , opening in 1841 . the city 's east end theatre district includes theatres that similarly date from 1850s to the 1920s , including the princess theatre , regent theatre , her majesty 's theatre , forum theatre , comedy theatre , and the athenaeum theatre . the melbourne arts precinct in southbank is home to arts centre melbourne , which includes the state theatre , hamer hall , the playhouse and the fairfax studio . the melbourne recital centre and southbank theatre ( principal home of the mtc , which includes the sumner and lawler performance spaces ) are also located in southbank . the sidney myer music bowl , which dates from 1955 , is located in the gardens of kings domain ; and the palais theatre is a feature of the st kilda beach foreshore .
the ownership of the spectre organisation - originally stylised " spectre " as an acronym of special executive for counter-intelligence , terrorism , revenge and extortion - and its characters , had been at the centre of long-standing litigation starting in 1961 between ian fleming and kevin mcclory over the film rights to the novel thunderball . the dispute began after fleming incorporated elements of an undeveloped film script written by mcclory and screenwriter jack whittingham - including characters and plot points - into thunderball , which mcclory contested in court , claiming ownership over elements of the novel . in 1963 , fleming settled out of court with mcclory , in an agreement which awarded mcclory the film rights . this enabled him to become a producer for the 1965 film thunderball - with albert r. broccoli and harry saltzman as executive producers - and the non-eon film never say never again , an updated remake of thunderball , in 1983 . [ n 3 ] a second remake , entitled warhead 2000 a.d. , was planned for production and release in the 1990s before being abandoned . under the terms of the 1963 settlement , the literary rights stayed with fleming , allowing the spectre organisation and associated characters to continue appearing in print .
more recently , articles in various financial periodicals , most notably forbes magazine , have pointed to fidel castro , general secretary of the republic of cuba since 1959 , of likely being the beneficiary of up to $ 900 million , based on " his control " of state-owned companies . opponents of his regime claim that he has used money amassed through weapons sales , narcotics , international loans , and confiscation of private property to enrich himself and his political cronies who hold his dictatorship together , and that the $ 900 million published by forbes is merely a portion of his assets , although that needs to be proven .
internationally , the torch and its accompanying party traveled in a chartered air china airbus a330 ( registered b-6075 ) , painted in the red and yellow colors of the olympic games . air china was chosen by the beijing committees of the olympic game as the designated olympic torch carrier in march 2008 for its long-standing participation in the olympic cause . the plane traveled a total of 137,000 km ( 85,000 mi ) for a duration of 130 days through 21 countries and regions .
the general assembly has considered rule of law as an agenda item since 1992 , with renewed interest since 2006 and has adopted resolutions at its last three sessions . the security council has held a number of thematic debates on the rule of law , and adopted resolutions emphasizing the importance of these issues in the context of women , peace and security , children in armed conflict , and the protection of civilians in armed conflict . the peacebuilding commission has also regularly addressed rule of law issues with respect to countries on its agenda . the vienna declaration and programme of action also requires the rule of law be included in human rights education .
the presbyterian church in taiwan ( pct ) is by far the largest protestant denomination in taiwan , with some 238,372 members as of 2009 ( including a majority of the island 's aborigines ) . english presbyterian missionary james laidlaw maxwell established the first presbyterian church in tainan in 1865 . his colleague george leslie mackay , of the canadian presbyterian mission , was active in danshui and north taiwan from 1872 to 1901 ; he founded the island 's first university and hospital , and created a written script for taiwanese minnan . the english and canadian missions joined together as the pct in 1912 . one of the few churches permitted to operate in taiwan through the era of japanese rule ( 1895-1945 ) , the pct experienced rapid growth during the era of guomindang-imposed martial law ( 1949-1987 ) , in part due to its support for democracy , human rights , and taiwan independence . former roc president lee teng-hui ( in office 1988-2000 ) is a presbyterian .
turkey : the torch relay leg in istanbul , held on april 3 , started on sultanahmet square and finished in taksim square . uyghurs living in turkey protested at chinese treatment of their compatriots living in xinjiang . several protesters who tried to disrupt the relay were promptly arrested by the police .
a police force is a constituted body of persons empowered by the state to enforce the law , protect property , and limit civil disorder . their powers include the legitimized use of force . the term is most commonly associated with police services of a sovereign state that are authorized to exercise the police power of that state within a defined legal or territorial area of responsibility . police forces are often defined as being separate from military or other organizations involved in the defense of the state against foreign aggressors ; however , gendarmerie are military units charged with civil policing .
on february 29 , 2012 , microsoft released windows 8 consumer preview , the beta version of windows 8 , build 8250 . alongside other changes , the build removed the start button from the taskbar for the first time since its debut on windows 95 ; according to windows manager chaitanya sareen , the start button was removed to reflect their view that on windows 8 , the desktop was an " app " itself , and not the primary interface of the operating system . windows president steven sinofsky said more than 100,000 changes had been made since the developer version went public . the day after its release , windows 8 consumer preview had been downloaded over one million times . like the developer preview , the consumer preview expired on january 15 , 2013 .
education in eritrea is officially compulsory between seven and 13 years of age . however , the education infrastructure is inadequate to meet current needs . statistics vary at the elementary level , suggesting that between 65 and 70 % of school-aged children attend primary school ; approximately 61 % attend secondary school . student-teacher ratios are high : 45 to 1 at the elementary level and 54 to 1 at the secondary level . there are an average 63 students per classroom at the elementary level and 97 per classroom at the secondary level . learning hours at school are often less than six hours per day . skill shortages are present at all levels of the education system , and funding for and access to education vary significantly by gender and location . illiteracy estimates for eritrea range from around 40 % to as high as 70 % .
for collectable or nostalgia purposes , or for the benefit of higher-quality audio playback provided by the 78 rpm speed with newer vinyl records and their lightweight stylus pickups , a small number of 78 rpm records have been released since the major labels ceased production . one of the first attempts at this was in the 1950s , when inventor ewing dunbar nunn founded the label audiophile records , which released , in addition to standard 33 1 / 3 rpm lps , 78 rpm-mastered albums that were microgroove and pressed on vinyl ( as opposed to traditional 78s , with their shellac composition and wider 3-mil sized grooves ) . this was done by the label mainly to take advantage of the wider audio frequency response that faster speeds like 78 rpm can provide for vinyl microgroove records , hence the label 's name ( obviously catering to the audiophiles of the 1950s " hi-fi " era , when stereo gear could provide a much wider range of audio than before ) . also in the late 1950s , bell records released a few budget-priced 7 " microgrooved records at 78 rpm .
for the anthropologists lieberman and jackson ( 1995 ) , however , there are more profound methodological and conceptual problems with using cladistics to support concepts of race . they claim that " the molecular and biochemical proponents of this model explicitly use racial categories in their initial grouping of samples . " for example , the large and highly diverse macroethnic groups of east indians , north africans , and europeans are presumptively grouped as caucasians prior to the analysis of their dna variation . this is claimed to limit and skew interpretations , obscure other lineage relationships , deemphasize the impact of more immediate clinal environmental factors on genomic diversity , and can cloud our understanding of the true patterns of affinity . they argue that however significant the empirical research , these studies use the term race in conceptually imprecise and careless ways . they suggest that the authors of these studies find support for racial distinctions only because they began by assuming the validity of race . " for empirical reasons we prefer to place emphasis on clinal variation , which recognizes the existence of adaptive human hereditary variation and simultaneously stresses that such variation is not found in packages that can be labeled races . "
during the period from 1993 to 2011 , fbi agents fired their weapons on 289 occasions ; fbi internal reviews found the shots justified in all but 5 cases , in none of the 5 cases were people wounded . samuel walker , a professor of criminal justice at the university of nebraska omaha said the number of shots found to be unjustified was " suspiciously low . " in the same time period , the fbi wounded 150 people , 70 of whom died ; the fbi found all 150 shootings to be justified . likewise , during the period from 2011 to the present , all shootings by fbi agents have been found to be justified by internal investigation . in a 2002 case in maryland , an innocent man was shot , and later paid $ 1.3 million by the fbi after agents mistook him for a bank robber ; the internal investigation found that the shooting was justified , based on the man 's actions .
in 2007 , the official xinhua news agency reported that the resolution of the beidou system was as high as 0.5 metres . with the existing user terminals it appears that the calibrated accuracy is 20m ( 100m , uncalibrated ) .
in march 2013 mendes said he would not return to direct the next film in the series , then known as bond 24 ; he later recanted and announced that he would return , as he found the script and the plans for the long-term future of the franchise appealing . in directing skyfall and spectre , mendes became the first director to oversee two consecutive bond films since john glen directed the living daylights and licence to kill in 1987 and 1989 . skyfall writer john logan resumed his role of scriptwriter , collaborating with neal purvis and robert wade , who returned for their sixth bond film . [ n 4 ] the writer jez butterworth also worked on the script , alongside mendes and craig . dennis gassner returned as the film 's production designer , while cinematographer hoyte van hoytema took over from roger deakins . in july 2015 mendes noted that the combined crew of spectre numbered over one thousand , making it a larger production than skyfall . craig is listed as co-producer .
tennessee politics , like that of most u.s. states , are dominated by the republican and the democratic parties . historian dewey w. grantham traces divisions in the state to the period of the american civil war : for decades afterward , the eastern third of the state was republican and the western two thirds voted democrat . this division was related to the state 's pattern of farming , plantations and slaveholding . the eastern section was made up of yeoman farmers , but middle and west tennessee cultivated crops , such as tobacco and cotton , that were dependent on the use of slave labor . these areas became defined as democratic after the war .
there are few accredited diplomats in bermuda . the united states maintains the largest diplomatic mission in bermuda , comprising both the united states consulate and the us customs and border protection services at the l.f. wade international airport . the current us consul general is robert settje , who took office in august 2012 . the united states is bermuda 's largest trading partner ( providing over 71 % of total imports , 85 % of tourist visitors , and an estimated $ 163 billion of us capital in the bermuda insurance / re-insurance industry ) , and an estimated 5 % of bermuda residents are us citizens , representing 14 % of all foreign-born persons . the american diplomatic presence is an important element in the bermuda political landscape .
despite odds of four to one , the iii corps launched a risky attack . the french were routed and the iii corps captured vionville , blocking any further escape attempts to the west . once blocked from retreat , the french in the fortress of metz had no choice but to engage in a fight that would see the last major cavalry engagement in western europe . the battle soon erupted , and iii corps was shattered by incessant cavalry charges , losing over half its soldiers . the german official history recorded 15,780 casualties and french casualties of 13,761 men .
in 1978 , sewall wright suggested that human populations that have long inhabited separated parts of the world should , in general , be considered different subspecies by the usual criterion that most individuals of such populations can be allocated correctly by inspection . wright argued that it does not require a trained anthropologist to classify an array of englishmen , west africans , and chinese with 100 % accuracy by features , skin color , and type of hair despite so much variability within each of these groups that every individual can easily be distinguished from every other . however , it is customary to use the term race rather than subspecies for the major subdivisions of the human species as well as for minor ones .
in a 2009 case , netbula , llc v. chordiant software inc . , defendant chordiant filed a motion to compel netbula to disable the robots.txt file on its web site that was causing the wayback machine to retroactively remove access to previous versions of pages it had archived from nebula 's site , pages that chordiant believed would support its case .
during the allied occupation of germany after world war ii , internal borders were redrawn by the allied military governments . no single state comprised more than 30 % of either population or territory ; this was intended to prevent any one state from being as dominant within germany as prussia had been in the past . initially , only seven of the pre-war states remained : baden ( in part ) , bavaria ( reduced in size ) , bremen , hamburg , hesse ( enlarged ) , saxony , and thuringia . the states with hyphenated names , such as rhineland-palatinate , north rhine-westphalia , and saxony-anhalt , owed their existence to the occupation powers and were created out of mergers of former prussian provinces and smaller states . former german territory that lie east of the oder-neisse line fell under either polish or soviet administration but attempts were made at least symbolically not to abandon sovereignty well into the 1960s . however , no attempts were made to establish new states in these territories as they lay outside the jurisdiction of west germany at that time .
this contrasts with the presidential system , in which the president ( or equivalent ) is both the head of state and the head of the government . in some presidential or semi-presidential systems , such as those of france , russia or south korea , the prime minister is an official generally appointed by the president but usually approved by the legislature and responsible for carrying out the directives of the president and managing the civil service . the head of government of the people 's republic of china is referred to as the premier of the state council and the premier of the republic of china ( taiwan ) is also appointed by the president , but requires no approval by the legislature .
the cultural role of copper has been important , particularly in currency . romans in the 6th through 3rd centuries bc used copper lumps as money . at first , the copper itself was valued , but gradually the shape and look of the copper became more important . julius caesar had his own coins made from brass , while octavianus augustus caesar 's coins were made from cu-pb-sn alloys . with an estimated annual output of around 15,000 t , roman copper mining and smelting activities reached a scale unsurpassed until the time of the industrial revolution ; the provinces most intensely mined were those of hispania , cyprus and in central europe .
by 1960 african americans comprised 16.45 % of the state 's population . it was not until after the mid-1960s and passage of the voting rights act of 1965 that they were able to vote in full again , but new devices , such as at-large commission city governments , had been adopted in several jurisdictions to limit their political participation . former gov. winfield dunn and former u.s. sen. bill brock wins in 1970 helped make the republican party competitive among whites for the statewide victory . tennessee has selected governors from different parties since 1970 . increasingly the republican party has become the party of white conservatives .
( the ms 6.1 earthquake on august 30 , 2008 in southern sichuan was not part of this series because it was caused by a different fault . see 2008 panzhihua earthquake for details . )
in association football , teams such as manchester united , bayern munich , liverpool , arsenal , toronto fc , and s.l. benfica primarily wear red jerseys . other teams that prominently feature red on their kits include a.c. milan ( nicknamed i rossoneri for their red and black shirts ) , afc ajax , olympiacos , river plate , atletico madrid , and flamengo . a red penalty card is issued to a player who commits a serious infraction : the player is immediately disqualified from further play and his team must continue with one less player for the game 's duration .
the fbi laboratory , established with the formation of the boi , did not appear in the j. edgar hoover building until its completion in 1974 . the lab serves as the primary lab for most dna , biological , and physical work . public tours of fbi headquarters ran through the fbi laboratory workspace before the move to the j. edgar hoover building . the services the lab conducts include chemistry , combined dna index system ( codis ) , computer analysis and response , dna analysis , evidence response , explosives , firearms and tool marks , forensic audio , forensic video , image analysis , forensic science research , forensic science training , hazardous materials response , investigative and prospective graphics , latent prints , materials analysis , questioned documents , racketeering records , special photographic analysis , structural design , and trace evidence . the services of the fbi laboratory are used by many state , local , and international agencies free of charge . the lab also maintains a second lab at the fbi academy .
the gregorian reform contained two parts : a reform of the julian calendar as used prior to pope gregory xiii 's time and a reform of the lunar cycle used by the church , with the julian calendar , to calculate the date of easter . the reform was a modification of a proposal made by aloysius lilius . his proposal included reducing the number of leap years in four centuries from 100 to 97 , by making 3 out of 4 centurial years common instead of leap years . lilius also produced an original and practical scheme for adjusting the epacts of the moon when calculating the annual date of easter , solving a long-standing obstacle to calendar reform .
in 2010 , the g.r. n 'namdi gallery opened in a 16,000-square-foot ( 1,500 m2 ) complex in midtown . important history of america and the detroit area are exhibited at the henry ford in dearborn , the united states ' largest indoor-outdoor museum complex . the detroit historical society provides information about tours of area churches , skyscrapers , and mansions . inside detroit , meanwhile , hosts tours , educational programming , and a downtown welcome center . other sites of interest are the detroit zoo in royal oak , the cranbrook art museum in bloomfield hills , the anna scripps whitcomb conservatory on belle isle , and walter p. chrysler museum in auburn hills .
new delhi is home to several historic sites and museums . the national museum which began with an exhibition of indian art and artefacts at the royal academy in london in the winter of 1947-48 was later at the end was shown at the rashtrapati bhawan in 1949 . later it was to form a permanent national museum . on 15 august 1949 , the national museum was formally inaugurated and currently has 200,000 works of art , both of indian and foreign origin , covering over 5,000 years .
little is known about the bacteria that degrade cellulose . symbiotic bacteria in xylophaga may play a role in the degradation of sunken wood ; while bacteria such as alphaproteobacteria , flavobacteria , actinobacteria , clostridia , and bacteroidetes have been detected in wood submerged over a year .
the knights of columbus , the world 's largest catholic fraternal service organization and a fortune 1000 company , is headquartered in new haven . two more fortune 1000 companies are based in greater new haven : the electrical equipment producers hubbell , based in orange , and amphenol , based in wallingford . eight courant 100 companies are based in greater new haven , with four headquartered in new haven proper . new haven-based companies traded on stock exchanges include newalliance bank , the second largest bank in connecticut and fourth-largest in new england ( nyse : nal ) , higher one holdings ( nyse : one ) , a financial services firm united illuminating , the electricity distributor for southern connecticut ( nyse : uil ) , achillion pharmaceuticals ( nasdaq : achn ) , alexion pharmaceuticals ( nasdaqgs : alxn ) , and transpro inc .

austrian-born adolf hitler had a lifelong romantic fascination with the alps and by the 1930s established a home in the obersalzberg region outside of berchtesgaden . his first visit to the area was in 1923 and he maintained a strong tie there until the end of his life . at the end of world war ii the us army occupied obersalzberg , to prevent hitler from retreating with the wehrmacht into the mountains .
at the end of the balkan wars , the extent of greece 's territory and population had increased . in the following years , the struggle between king constantine i and charismatic prime minister eleftherios venizelos over the country 's foreign policy on the eve of world war i dominated the country 's political scene , and divided the country into two opposing groups . during parts of the first world war , greece had two governments ; a royalist pro-german government in athens and a venizelist pro-britain one in thessaloniki . the two governments were united in 1917 , when greece officially entered the war on the side of the triple entente .
in 77 bc , the senate sent one of sulla 's former lieutenants , gnaeus pompeius magnus ( " pompey the great " ) , to put down an uprising in spain . by 71 bc , pompey returned to rome after having completed his mission . around the same time , another of sulla 's former lieutenants , marcus licinius crassus , had just put down the spartacus-led gladiator / slave revolt in italy . upon their return , pompey and crassus found the populares party fiercely attacking sulla 's constitution . they attempted to forge an agreement with the populares party . if both pompey and crassus were elected consul in 70 bc , they would dismantle the more obnoxious components of sulla 's constitution . the two were soon elected , and quickly dismantled most of sulla 's constitution .
cultural barriers can also keep a person from telling someone they are in pain . religious beliefs may prevent the individual from seeking help . they may feel certain pain treatment is against their religion . they may not report pain because they feel it is a sign that death is near . many people fear the stigma of addiction and avoid pain treatment so as not to be prescribed potentially addicting drugs . many asians do not want to lose respect in society by admitting they are in pain and need help , believing the pain should be borne in silence , while other cultures feel they should report pain right away and get immediate relief . gender can also be a factor in reporting pain . sexual differences can be the result of social and cultural expectations , with women expected to be emotional and show pain and men stoic , keeping pain to themselves .
" first of all , a samurai who dislikes battle and has not put his heart in the right place even though he has been born in the house of the warrior , should not be reckoned among one 's retainers .... it is forbidden to forget the great debt of kindness one owes to his master and ancestors and thereby make light of the virtues of loyalty and filial piety .... it is forbidden that one should ... attach little importance to his duties to his master ... there is a primary need to distinguish loyalty from disloyalty and to establish rewards and punishments . "
after kerry 's 1972 defeat , he and his wife bought a house in belvidere , lowell , entering a decade which his brother cameron later called " the years in exile . " he spent some time working as a fundraiser for the cooperative for assistance and relief everywhere ( care ) , an international humanitarian organization . in september 1973 , he entered boston college law school . while studying , kerry worked as a talk radio host on wbz and , in july 1974 , was named executive director of mass action , a massachusetts advocacy association .
several campus safety strategies have been pioneered at yale . the first campus police force was founded at yale in 1894 , when the university contracted city police officers to exclusively cover the campus . later hired by the university , the officers were originally brought in to quell unrest between students and city residents and curb destructive student behavior . in addition to the yale police department , a variety of safety services are available including blue phones , a safety escort , and 24-hour shuttle service .
space superiority is " the degree of dominance in space of one force over another that permits the conduct of operations by the former and its related land , sea , air , space , and special operations forces at a given time and place without prohibitive interference by the opposing force " ( jp 1-02 ) . space superiority may be localized in time and space , or it may be broad and enduring . space superiority provides freedom of action in space for friendly forces and , when directed , denies the same freedom to the adversary .
the army is also changing its base unit from divisions to brigades . division lineage will be retained , but the divisional headquarters will be able to command any brigade , not just brigades that carry their divisional lineage . the central part of this plan is that each brigade will be modular , i.e. , all brigades of the same type will be exactly the same , and thus any brigade can be commanded by any division . as specified before the 2013 end-strength re-definitions , the three major types of ground combat brigades are :
after charles ii of england ( 1630-1685 ) was restored to the english throne in 1660 following oliver cromwell 's protectorate , he granted the chartered province of carolina to eight of his loyal friends , known as the lords proprietors , on march 24 , 1663 . it took seven years before the group arranged for settlement expeditions . the first of these founded charles town , in 1670 . governance , settlement , and development were to follow a visionary plan known as the grand model prepared for the lords proprietors by john locke .
tourism is a vital industry for new york city , which has witnessed a growing combined volume of international and domestic tourists - receiving approximately 51 million tourists in 2011 , 54 million in 2013 , and a record 56.4 million in 2014 . tourism generated an all-time high us $ 61.3 billion in overall economic impact for new york city in 2014 .
increasing state control over the oil sector , the rcc began a program of nationalization , starting with the expropriation of british petroleum 's share of the british petroleum-n.b. hunt sahir field in december 1971 . in september 1973 , it was announced that all foreign oil producers active in libya were to be nationalized . for gaddafi , this was an important step towards socialism . it proved an economic success ; while gross domestic product had been $ 3.8 billion in 1969 , it had risen to $ 13.7 billion in 1974 , and $ 24.5 billion in 1979 . in turn , the libyans ' standard of life greatly improved over the first decade of gaddafi 's administration , and by 1979 the average per-capita income was at $ 8,170 , up from $ 40 in 1951 ; this was above the average of many industrialized countries like italy and the u.k .
sleep does not affect acquisition or recall while one is awake . therefore , sleep has the greatest effect on memory consolidation . during sleep , the neural connections in the brain are strengthened . this enhances the brain 's abilities to stabilize and retain memories . there have been several studies which show that sleep improves the retention of memory , as memories are enhanced through active consolidation . system consolidation takes place during slow-wave sleep ( sws ) . this process implicates that memories are reactivated during sleep , but that the process doesn 't enhance every memory . it also implicates that qualitative changes are made to the memories when they are transferred to long-term store during sleep . when you are sleeping , the hippocampus replays the events of the day for the neocortex . the neocortex then reviews and processes memories , which moves them into long-term memory . when you do not get enough sleep it makes it more difficult to learn as these neural connections are not as strong , resulting in a lower retention rate of memories . sleep deprivation makes it harder to focus , resulting in inefficient learning . furthermore , some studies have shown that sleep deprivation can lead to false memories as the memories are not properly transferred to long-term memory . therefore , it is important to get the proper amount of sleep so that memory can function at the highest level . one of the primary functions of sleep is thought to be the improvement of the consolidation of information , as several studies have demonstrated that memory depends on getting sufficient sleep between training and test . additionally , data obtained from neuroimaging studies have shown activation patterns in the sleeping brain that mirror those recorded during the learning of tasks from the previous day , suggesting that new memories may be solidified through such rehearsal .
new haven has a history of professional sports franchises dating back to the 19th century and has been the home to professional baseball , basketball , football , hockey , and soccer teams - including the new york giants of the national football league from 1973 to 1974 , who played at the yale bowl . throughout the second half of the 20th century , new haven consistently had minor league hockey and baseball teams , which played at the new haven arena ( built in 1926 , demolished in 1972 ) , new haven coliseum ( 1972-2002 ) , and yale field ( 1928-present ) .
the bipolar junction transistor ( bjt ) was the most commonly used transistor in the 1960s and 70s . even after mosfets became widely available , the bjt remained the transistor of choice for many analog circuits such as amplifiers because of their greater linearity and ease of manufacture . in integrated circuits , the desirable properties of mosfets allowed them to capture nearly all market share for digital circuits . discrete mosfets can be applied in transistor applications , including analog circuits , voltage regulators , amplifiers , power transmitters and motor drivers .
south africa occupied the colony in 1915 after defeating the german force during world war i and administered it from 1919 onward as a league of nations mandate territory . although the south african government desired to incorporate ' south-west africa ' into its territory , it never officially did so , although it was administered as the de facto ' fifth province ' , with the white minority having representation in the whites-only parliament of south africa , as well as electing their own local administration the swa legislative assembly . the south african government also appointed the swa administrator , who had extensive powers . following the league 's replacement by the united nations in 1946 , south africa refused to surrender its earlier mandate to be replaced by a united nations trusteeship agreement , requiring closer international monitoring of the territory 's administration ( along with a definite independence schedule ) . the herero chief 's council submitted a number of petitions to the un calling for it to grant namibia independence during the 1950s . during the 1960s , when european powers granted independence to their colonies and trust territories in africa , pressure mounted on south africa to do so in namibia . in 1966 the international court of justice dismissed a complaint brought by ethiopia and liberia against south africa 's continued presence in the territory , but the u.n. general assembly subsequently revoked south africa 's mandate , while in 1971 the international court of justice issued an " advisory opinion " declaring south africa 's continued administration to be illegal .
as the centre of australia 's " rust belt , " melbourne experienced an economic downturn between 1989 to 1992 , following the collapse of several local financial institutions . in 1992 the newly elected kennett government began a campaign to revive the economy with an aggressive development campaign of public works coupled with the promotion of the city as a tourist destination with a focus on major events and sports tourism . during this period the australian grand prix moved to melbourne from adelaide . major projects included the construction of a new facility for the melbourne museum , federation square , the melbourne exhibition and convention centre , crown casino and the citylink tollway . other strategies included the privatisation of some of melbourne 's services , including power and public transport , and a reduction in funding to public services such as health , education and public transport infrastructure .
infrared is used in night vision equipment when there is insufficient visible light to see . night vision devices operate through a process involving the conversion of ambient light photons into electrons that are then amplified by a chemical and electrical process and then converted back into visible light . infrared light sources can be used to augment the available ambient light for conversion by night vision devices , increasing in-the-dark visibility without actually using a visible light source .
in 1872 , russian alexander lodygin invented an incandescent light bulb and obtained a russian patent in 1874 . he used as a burner two carbon rods of diminished section in a glass receiver , hermetically sealed , and filled with nitrogen , electrically arranged so that the current could be passed to the second carbon when the first had been consumed . later he lived in the usa , changed his name to alexander de lodyguine and applied and obtained patents for incandescent lamps having chromium , iridium , rhodium , ruthenium , osmium , molybdenum and tungsten filaments , and a bulb using a molybdenum filament was demonstrated at the world fair of 1900 in paris .
portuguese wines have enjoyed international recognition since the times of the romans , who associated portugal with their god bacchus . today , the country is known by wine lovers and its wines have won several international prizes . some of the best portuguese wines are : vinho verde , vinho alvarinho , vinho do douro , vinho do alentejo , vinho do dao , vinho da bairrada and the sweet : port wine , madeira wine , the moscatel from setubal and favaios . port and madeira are particularly appreciated in a wide range of places around the world .
the band , now revitalised by the response to live aid - a " shot in the arm " roger taylor called it , - and the ensuing increase in record sales , ended 1985 by releasing the single " one vision , " which was the third time after " stone cold crazy " and " under pressure ( with david bowie ) " that all four bandmembers received a writing credit for the one song . also , a limited-edition boxed set containing all queen albums to date was released under the title of the complete works . the package included previously unreleased material , most notably queen 's non-album single of christmas 1984 , titled " thank god it 's christmas .

the city 's primary commercial airport is the san diego international airport ( san ) , also known as lindbergh field . it is the busiest single-runway airport in the united states . it served over 17 million passengers in 2005 , and is dealing with an increasingly larger number every year . it is located on san diego bay three miles ( 4.8 km ) from downtown . san diego international airport maintains scheduled flights to the rest of the united states including hawaii , as well as to mexico , canada , japan , and the united kingdom . it is operated by an independent agency , the san diego regional airport authority . in addition , the city itself operates two general-aviation airports , montgomery field ( myf ) and brown field ( sdm ) . by 2015 , the tijuana cross-border terminal in otay mesa will give direct access to tijuana international airport , with passengers walking across the u.s.-mexico border on a footbridge to catch their flight on the mexican side .
cyprus ( i / ˈsaɪprəs / ; greek : κυπρος ipa : [ ˈcipros ] ; turkish : kıbrıs ipa : [ ˈkɯbɾɯs ] ) , officially the republic of cyprus ( greek : κυπριακη δημοκρατια ; turkish : kıbrıs cumhuriyeti ) , is an island country in the eastern mediterranean sea , off the coasts of syria and turkey . [ e ] cyprus is the third largest and third most populous island in the mediterranean , and a member state of the european union . it is located south of turkey , west of syria and lebanon , northwest of israel and palestine , north of egypt and east of greece .
the soviet union also fixed the parachute and control problems with soyuz , and the next piloted mission soyuz 3 was launched on october 26 , 1968 . the goal was to complete komarov 's rendezvous and docking mission with the un-piloted soyuz 2 . ground controllers brought the two craft to within 200 meters ( 660 ft ) of each other , then cosmonaut georgy beregovoy took control . he got within 40 meters ( 130 ft ) of his target , but was unable to dock before expending 90 percent of his maneuvering fuel , due to a piloting error that put his spacecraft into the wrong orientation and forced soyuz 2 to automatically turn away from his approaching craft . the first docking of soviet spacecraft was finally realised in january 1969 by the soyuz 4 and soyuz 5 missions . it was the first-ever docking of two manned spacecraft , and the first transfer of crew from one space vehicle to another .
the consensus among linguists is that modern , standard czech originated during the eighteenth century . by then the language had developed a literary tradition , and since then it has changed little ; journals from that period have no substantial differences from modern standard czech , and contemporary czechs can understand them with little difficulty . changes include the morphological shift of i to ej and e to i ( although e survives for some uses ) and the merging of i and the former eji . sometime before the eighteenth century , the czech language abandoned a distinction between phonemic / l / and / ʎ / which survives in slovak .
in 1982 , regis mckenna was brought in to shape the marketing and launch of the macintosh . later the regis mckenna team grew to include jane anderson , katie cadigan and andy cunningham , who eventually led the apple account for the agency . cunningham and anderson were the primary authors of the macintosh launch plan . the launch of the macintosh pioneered many different tactics that are used today in launching technology products , including the " multiple exclusive , " event marketing ( credited to john sculley , who brought the concept over from pepsi ) , creating a mystique around a product and giving an inside look into a product 's creation .
in january 1957 , the us adopted the eisenhower doctrine and pledged to prevent the spread of communism and its perceived agents in the middle east . although nasser was an opponent of communism in the region , his promotion of pan-arabism was viewed as a threat by pro-western states in the region . eisenhower tried to isolate nasser and reduce his regional influence by attempting to transform king saud into a counterweight . also in january , the elected jordanian prime minister and nasser supporter sulayman al-nabulsi brought jordan into a military pact with egypt , syria , and saudi arabia .
the anti-clerical feeling was widespread , and durango supported the initial reaction against the government at mexico . in may 1832 , jose urrea , a rising officer , supported the restoration of president pedraza . on july 20 , governor elorriaga was reinstated , and baca along with the legislative minority were brought back to form a new legislature , which met on september 1 . chihuahua showed no desire to imitate the revolutionary movement and urrea prepared to invade the state . comandante-general j.j.calvo threatened to retaliate , and a conflict seemed imminent . the entry of general santa anna into mexico brought calm , as the leaders waited for clarity .
the majority of studies indicate antibiotics do interfere with contraceptive pills , such as clinical studies that suggest the failure rate of contraceptive pills caused by antibiotics is very low ( about 1 % ) . in cases where antibacterials have been suggested to affect the efficiency of birth control pills , such as for the broad-spectrum antibacterial rifampicin , these cases may be due to an increase in the activities of hepatic liver enzymes ' causing increased breakdown of the pill 's active ingredients . effects on the intestinal flora , which might result in reduced absorption of estrogens in the colon , have also been suggested , but such suggestions have been inconclusive and controversial . clinicians have recommended that extra contraceptive measures be applied during therapies using antibacterials that are suspected to interact with oral contraceptives .
the university of kansas school of law was the top law school in the state of kansas , and 68th nationally , according to the 2014 u.s. news & world report " best graduate schools " edition . classes are held in green hall at w 15th st and burdick dr , which is named after former dean james green .
in the everyday world , many individuals sought to divine the future , influence it through magic , or seek vengeance with help from " private " diviners . the state-sanctioned taking of auspices was a form of public divination with the intent of ascertaining the will of the gods , not foretelling the future . secretive consultations between private diviners and their clients were thus suspect . so were divinatory techniques such as astrology when used for illicit , subversive or magical purposes . astrologers and magicians were officially expelled from rome at various times , notably in 139 bc and 33 bc . in 16 bc tiberius expelled them under extreme penalty because an astrologer had predicted his death . " egyptian rites " were particularly suspect : augustus banned them within the pomerium to doubtful effect ; tiberius repeated and extended the ban with extreme force in ad 19 . despite several imperial bans , magic and astrology persisted among all social classes . in the late 1st century ad , tacitus observed that astrologers " would always be banned and always retained at rome . "
after fidel castro rose to power in cuba in 1959 , many wealthy cubans sought refuge in miami , further increasing the population . the city developed businesses and cultural amenities as part of the new south . in the 1980s and 1990s , south florida weathered social problems related to drug wars , immigration from haiti and latin america , and the widespread destruction of hurricane andrew . racial and cultural tensions were sometimes sparked , but the city developed in the latter half of the 20th century as a major international , financial , and cultural center . it is the second-largest u.s. city ( after el paso , texas ) with a spanish-speaking majority , and the largest city with a cuban-american plurality .
instruments have divided christendom since their introduction into worship . they were considered a catholic innovation , not widely practiced until the 18th century , and were opposed vigorously in worship by a number of protestant reformers , including martin luther ( 1483-1546 ) , ulrich zwingli , john calvin ( 1509-1564 ) and john wesley ( 1703-1791 ) . alexander campbell referred to the use of an instrument in worship as " a cow bell in a concert . " in sir walter scott 's the heart of midlothian , the heroine , jeanie deans , a scottish presbyterian , writes to her father about the church situation she has found in england ( bold added ) :
on 20 october 1944 the u.s. sixth army , supported by naval and air bombardment , landed on the favorable eastern shore of leyte , north of mindanao . the u.s. sixth army continued its advance from the east , as the japanese rushed reinforcements to the ormoc bay area on the western side of the island . while the sixth army was reinforced successfully , the u.s. fifth air force was able to devastate the japanese attempts to resupply . in torrential rains and over difficult terrain , the advance continued across leyte and the neighboring island of samar to the north . on 7 december u.s. army units landed at ormoc bay and , after a major land and air battle , cut off the japanese ability to reinforce and supply leyte . although fierce fighting continued on leyte for months , the u.s. army was in control .
popper puzzled over the stark contrast between the non-scientific character of freud and adler 's theories in the field of psychology and the revolution set off by einstein 's theory of relativity in physics in the early 20th century . popper thought that einstein 's theory , as a theory properly grounded in scientific thought and method , was highly " risky , " in the sense that it was possible to deduce consequences from it which were , in the light of the then-dominant newtonian physics , highly improbable ( e.g. , that light is deflected towards solid bodies - confirmed by eddington 's experiments in 1919 ) , and which would , if they turned out to be false , falsify the whole theory . in contrast , nothing could , even in principle , falsify psychoanalytic theories . he thus came to the conclusion that psychoanalytic theories had more in common with primitive myths than with genuine science .
one wave of the population boom ended abruptly in the mid-1980s , as oil prices fell precipitously . the space industry also suffered in 1986 after the space shuttle challenger disintegrated shortly after launch . there was a cutback in some activities for a period . in the late 1980s , the city 's economy suffered from the nationwide recession . after the early 1990s recession , houston made efforts to diversify its economy by focusing on aerospace and health care / biotechnology , and reduced its dependence on the petroleum industry . since the increase of oil prices in the 2000s , the petroleum industry has again increased its share of the local economy .
arsenal 's financial results for the 2014-15 season show group revenue of £ 344.5m , with a profit before tax of £ 24.7m. the footballing core of the business showed a revenue of £ 329.3m. the deloitte football money league is a publication that homogenizes and compares clubs ' annual revenue . they put arsenal 's footballing revenue at £ 331.3m ( € 435.5m ) , ranking arsenal seventh among world football clubs . arsenal and deloitte both list the match day revenue generated by the emirates stadium as £ 100.4m , more than any other football stadium in the world .
at the dawn of the grand lodge era , during the 1720s , james anderson composed the first printed constitutions for freemasons , the basis for most subsequent constitutions , which specifically excluded women from freemasonry . as freemasonry spread , continental masons began to include their ladies in lodges of adoption , which worked three degrees with the same names as the men 's but different content . the french officially abandoned the experiment in the early 19th century . later organisations with a similar aim emerged in the united states , but distinguished the names of the degrees from those of male masonry .
in sheer numbers , kerry had fewer endorsements than howard dean , who was far ahead in the superdelegate race going into the iowa caucuses in january 2004 , although kerry led the endorsement race in iowa , new hampshire , arizona , south carolina , new mexico and nevada . kerry 's main perceived weakness was in his neighboring state of new hampshire and nearly all national polls . most other states did not have updated polling numbers to give an accurate placing for the kerry campaign before iowa . heading into the primaries , kerry 's campaign was largely seen as in trouble , particularly after he fired campaign manager jim jordan . the key factors enabling it to survive were when fellow massachusetts senator ted kennedy assigned mary beth cahill to be the campaign manager , as well as kerry 's mortgaging his own home to lend the money to his campaign ( while his wife was a billionaire , campaign finance rules prohibited using one 's personal fortune ) . he also brought on the " magical " michael whouley who would be credited with helping bring home the iowa victory the same as he did in new hampshire for al gore in 2000 against bill bradley .
there were also 12 cm ( 4.7 in ) ( cd size ) " single " -style discs produced that were playable on laserdisc players . these were referred to as cd video ( cd-v ) discs , and video single discs ( vsd ) . a cd-v carried up to five minutes of analog laserdisc-type video content ( usually a music video ) , as well as up to 20 minutes of digital audio cd tracks . the original 1989 release of david bowie 's retrospective sound + vision cd box set prominently featured a cd-v video of ashes to ashes , and standalone promo cd-vs featured the video , plus three audio tracks : " john , i 'm only dancing , " " changes , " and " the supermen . "
although almost all ancient sources relating to crucifixion are literary , the 1968 archeological discovery just northeast of jerusalem of the body of a crucified man dated to the 1st century provided good confirmatory evidence that crucifixions occurred during the roman period roughly according to the manner in which the crucifixion of jesus is described in the gospels . the crucified man was identified as yehohanan ben hagkol and probably died about 70 ad , around the time of the jewish revolt against rome . the analyses at the hadassah medical school estimated that he died in his late 20s . another relevant archaeological find , which also dates to the 1st century ad , is an unidentified heel bone with a spike discovered in a jerusalem gravesite , now held by the israel antiquities authority and displayed in the israel museum .
josip broz tito received a total of 119 awards and decorations from 60 countries around the world ( 59 countries and yugoslavia ) . 21 decorations were from yugoslavia itself , 18 having been awarded once , and the order of the national hero on three occasions . of the 98 international awards and decorations , 92 were received once , and three on two occasions ( order of the white lion , polonia restituta , and karl marx ) . the most notable awards included the french legion of honour and national order of merit , the british order of the bath , the soviet order of lenin , the japanese order of the chrysanthemum , the german federal cross of merit , and the order of merit of italy .
the political stability and development of hydrocarbon production made republic of congo the fourth largest oil producer in the gulf of guinea and provided the country with a relative prosperity despite the poor state of its infrastructure and public services and an unequal distribution of oil revenues .
glass is in widespread use largely due to the production of glass compositions that are transparent to visible light . in contrast , polycrystalline materials do not generally transmit visible light . the individual crystallites may be transparent , but their facets ( grain boundaries ) reflect or scatter light resulting in diffuse reflection . glass does not contain the internal subdivisions associated with grain boundaries in polycrystals and hence does not scatter light in the same manner as a polycrystalline material . the surface of a glass is often smooth since during glass formation the molecules of the supercooled liquid are not forced to dispose in rigid crystal geometries and can follow surface tension , which imposes a microscopically smooth surface . these properties , which give glass its clearness , can be retained even if glass is partially light-absorbing - i.e. , colored .
the game pad controllers were more-or-less copied directly from the game & watch machines , although the famicom design team originally wanted to use arcade-style joysticks , even taking apart ones from american game consoles to see how they worked . however , it was eventually decided that children might step on joysticks left on the floor and their durability was also questioned . katsuyah nakawaka attached a game & watch d-pad to the famicom prototype and found that it was easy to use and had no discomfort . ultimately though , they did install a 15-pin expansion port on the front of the console so that an arcade-style joystick could be used optionally . the controllers were hard-wired to the console with no connectors for cost reasons .
to compete with the popular family computer in japan , nec home electronics launched the pc engine in 1987 , and sega enterprises followed suit with the mega drive in 1988 . the two platforms were later launched in north america in 1989 as the turbografx-16 and the genesis respectively . both systems were built on 16-bit architectures and offered improved graphics and sound over the 8-bit nes . however , it took several years for sega 's system to become successful . nintendo executives were in no rush to design a new system , but they reconsidered when they began to see their dominance in the market slipping .
the university 's medical center and university hospital are located in kansas city , kansas . the edwards campus is in overland park , kansas , in the kansas city metropolitan area . there are also educational and research sites in parsons and topeka , and branches of the university of kansas school of medicine in wichita and salina . the university is one of the 62 members of the association of american universities .
bern was occupied by french troops in 1798 during the french revolutionary wars , when it was stripped of parts of its territories . it regained control of the bernese oberland in 1802 , and following the congress of vienna of 1814 , it newly acquired the bernese jura . at this time , it once again became the largest canton of the confederacy as it stood during the restoration and until the secession of the canton of jura in 1979 . bern was made the federal city ( seat of the federal assembly ) within the new swiss federal state in 1848 .
stone and brick became the city 's building materials of choice after the construction of wood-frame houses was limited in the aftermath of the great fire of 1835 . a distinctive feature of many of the city 's buildings is the wooden roof-mounted water towers . in the 1800s , the city required their installation on buildings higher than six stories to prevent the need for excessively high water pressures at lower elevations , which could break municipal water pipes . garden apartments became popular during the 1920s in outlying areas , such as jackson heights .
in charleston , the african american population increased as freedmen moved from rural areas to the major city : from 17,000 in 1860 to over 27,000 in 1880 . historian eric foner noted that blacks were glad to be relieved of the many regulations of slavery and to operate outside of white surveillance . among other changes , most blacks quickly left the southern baptist church , setting up their own black baptist congregations or joining new african methodist episcopal church and ame zion churches , both independent black denominations first established in the north . freedmen " acquired dogs , guns , and liquor ( all barred to them under slavery ) , and refused to yield the sidewalks to whites . "
kerry chaired the senate select committee on pow / mia affairs from 1991 to 1993 . the committee 's report , which kerry endorsed , stated there was " no compelling evidence that proves that any american remains alive in captivity in southeast asia . " in 1994 the senate passed a resolution , sponsored by kerry and fellow vietnam veteran john mccain , that called for an end to the existing trade embargo against vietnam ; it was intended to pave the way for normalization . in 1995 , president bill clinton normalized diplomatic relations with the country of vietnam .
as of 2005 , there were over 50 churches recognized as cardinalatial deaconries , though there were only 30 cardinals of the order of deacons . cardinal deacons have long enjoyed the right to " opt for the order of cardinal priests " ( optazione ) after they have been cardinal deacons for 10 years . they may on such elevation take a vacant " title " ( a church allotted to a cardinal priest as the church in rome with which he is associated ) or their diaconal church may be temporarily elevated to a cardinal priest 's " title " for that occasion . when elevated to cardinal priests , they take their precedence according to the day they were first made cardinal deacons ( thus ranking above cardinal priests who were elevated to the college after them , regardless of order ) .
while exploring inland along the northern coast of florida in 1528 , the members of the narvaez expedition , including alvar nunez cabeza de vaca , found a native american village near present-day tallahassee , florida whose name they transcribed as apalchen or apalachen [ a.paˈla.tʃɛn ] . the name was soon altered by the spanish to apalachee and used as a name for the tribe and region spreading well inland to the north . panfilo de narvaez 's expedition first entered apalachee territory on june 15 , 1528 , and applied the name . now spelled " appalachian , " it is the fourth-oldest surviving european place-name in the us .
until recently , in most critical writing the post-punk era was " often dismissed as an awkward period in which punk 's gleeful ructions petered out into the vacuity of the eighties . " contemporary scholars have argued to the contrary , asserting that the period produced significant innovations and music on its own . simon reynolds described the period as " a fair match for the sixties in terms of the sheer amount of great music created , the spirit of adventure and idealism that infused it , and the way that the music seemed inextricably connected to the political and social turbulence of its era . " nicholas lezard wrote that the music of the period " was avant-garde , open to any musical possibilities that suggested themselves , united only in the sense that it was very often cerebral , concocted by brainy young men and women interested as much in disturbing the audience , or making them think , as in making a pop song . "
polemics about humanism have sometimes assumed paradoxical twists and turns . early 20th century critics such as ezra pound , t. e. hulme , and t. s. eliot considered humanism to be sentimental " slop " ( hulme ) [ citation needed ] or " an old bitch gone in the teeth " ( pound ) and wanted to go back to a more manly , authoritarian society such as ( they believed ) existed in the middle ages . postmodern critics who are self-described anti-humanists , such as jean-francois lyotard and michel foucault , have asserted that humanism posits an overarching and excessively abstract notion of humanity or universal human nature , which can then be used as a pretext for imperialism and domination of those deemed somehow less than human . " humanism fabricates the human as much as it fabricates the nonhuman animal , " suggests timothy laurie , turning the human into what he calls " a placeholder for a range of attributes that have been considered most virtuous among humans ( e.g. rationality , altruism ) , rather than most commonplace ( e.g. hunger , anger ) . " nevertheless , philosopher kate soper notes that by faulting humanism for falling short of its own benevolent ideals , anti-humanism thus frequently " secretes a humanist rhetoric . "
interspersed repeats mainly come from transposable elements ( tes ) , but they also include some protein coding gene families and pseudogenes . transposable elements are able to integrate into the genome at another site within the cell . it is believed that tes are an important driving force on genome evolution of higher eukaryotes . tes can be classified into two categories , class 1 ( retrotransposons ) and class 2 ( dna transposons ) .
john was born to henry ii of england and eleanor of aquitaine on 24 december 1166 . henry had inherited significant territories along the atlantic seaboard - anjou , normandy and england - and expanded his empire by conquering brittany . henry married the powerful eleanor of aquitaine , who reigned over the duchy of aquitaine and had a tenuous claim to toulouse and auvergne in southern france , in addition to being the former wife of louis vii of france . the result was the angevin empire , named after henry 's paternal title as count of anjou and , more specifically , its seat in angers . [ nb 2 ] the empire , however , was inherently fragile : although all the lands owed allegiance to henry , the disparate parts each had their own histories , traditions and governance structures . as one moved south through anjou and aquitaine , the extent of henry 's power in the provinces diminished considerably , scarcely resembling the modern concept of an empire at all . some of the traditional ties between parts of the empire such as normandy and england were slowly dissolving over time . it was unclear what would happen to the empire on henry 's death . although the custom of primogeniture , under which an eldest son would inherit all his father 's lands , was slowly becoming more widespread across europe , it was less popular amongst the norman kings of england . most believed that henry would divide the empire , giving each son a substantial portion , and hoping that his children would continue to work together as allies after his death . to complicate matters , much of the angevin empire was held by henry only as a vassal of the king of france of the rival line of the house of capet . henry had often allied himself with the holy roman emperor against france , making the feudal relationship even more challenging .
from 1877 to 1878 , the area suffered a rash of stagecoach robberies . most notable , however , were the two holdups committed by masked road-agent william whitney brazelton . brazelton held up two stages in the summer of 1878 near point of mountain station approximately 17 mi ( 27 km ) northwest of tucson . john clum , of tombstone , arizona fame was one of the passengers . brazelton was eventually tracked down and killed on monday august 19 , 1878 , in a mesquite bosque along the santa cruz river 3 miles ( 5 km ) south of tucson by pima county sheriff charles a. shibell and his citizen 's posse . brazelton had been suspected of highway robbery not only in the tucson area , but also in the prescott region and silver city , new mexico area as well . brazelton 's crimes prompted john j. valentine , sr. of wells , fargo & co. to send special agent and future pima county sheriff bob paul to investigate . fort lowell , then east of tucson , was established to help protect settlers from apache attacks . in 1882 , frank stilwell was implicated in the murder of morgan earp by cowboy pete spence 's wife , marietta , at the coroner 's inquest on morgan earp 's shooting . the coroner 's jury concluded that spence , stilwell , frederick bode , and florentino " indian charlie " cruz were the prime suspects in the assassination of morgan earp . : 250 deputy u.s. marshal wyatt earp gathered a few trusted friends and accompanied virgil earp and his family as they traveled to benson for a train ride to california . they found stilwell lying in wait for virgil in the tucson station and killed him on the tracks . after killing stilwell , wyatt deputized others and rode on a vendetta , killing three more cowboys over the next few days before leaving the state .
as a result of the abolition of serfdom and the availability of education to the native estonian-speaking population , an active estonian nationalist movement developed in the 19th century . [ citation needed ] it began on a cultural level , resulting in the establishment of estonian language literature , theatre and professional music and led on to the formation of the estonian national identity and the age of awakening . among the leaders of the movement were johann voldemar jannsen , jakob hurt and carl robert jakobson .
while pro wrestling is often described simplistically as a " soap opera for males , " it has also been cited as filling the role of past forms of literature and theatre ; a synthesis of classical heroics , commedia dell 'arte , revenge tragedies , morality plays , and burlesque . the characters and storylines portrayed by a successful promotion are seen to reflect the current mood , attitudes , and concerns of that promotion 's society ( and can , in turn , influence those same things ) . wrestling 's high levels of violence and masculinity make it a vicarious outlet for aggression during peacetime .
the population of israel , as defined by the israel central bureau of statistics , was estimated in 2016 to be 8,476,600 people . it is the world 's only jewish-majority state , with 6,345,400 citizens , or 74.9 % , being designated as jewish . the country 's second largest group of citizens are denoted as arabs , numbering 1,760,400 people ( including the druze and most east jerusalem arabs ) . the great majority of israeli arabs are sunni muslims , with smaller but significant numbers of semi-settled negev bedouins ; the rest are christians and druze . other far smaller minorities include maronites , samaritans , dom people and roma , black hebrew israelites , other sub-saharan africans , armenians , circassians , vietnamese boat people , and others . israel also hosts a significant population of non-citizen foreign workers and asylum seekers from africa and asia .
beginning with immanuel kant , german idealists such as g. w. f. hegel , johann gottlieb fichte , friedrich wilhelm joseph schelling , and arthur schopenhauer dominated 19th-century philosophy . this tradition , which emphasized the mental or " ideal " character of all phenomena , gave birth to idealistic and subjectivist schools ranging from british idealism to phenomenalism to existentialism . the historical influence of this branch of idealism remains central even to the schools that rejected its metaphysical assumptions , such as marxism , pragmatism and positivism .
in february 2015 , youtube announced the launch of a new app specifically for use by children visiting the site , called youtube kids . it allows parental controls and restrictions on who can upload content , and is available for both android and ios devices . later on august 26 , 2015 , youtube gaming was launched , a platform for video gaming enthusiasts intended to compete with twitch.tv. 2015 also saw the announcement of a premium youtube service titled youtube red , which provides users with both ad-free content as well as the ability to download videos among other features .
endospores show no detectable metabolism and can survive extreme physical and chemical stresses , such as high levels of uv light , gamma radiation , detergents , disinfectants , heat , freezing , pressure , and desiccation . in this dormant state , these organisms may remain viable for millions of years , and endospores even allow bacteria to survive exposure to the vacuum and radiation in space . according to scientist dr. steinn sigurdsson , " there are viable bacterial spores that have been found that are 40 million years old on earth - and we know they 're very hardened to radiation . " endospore-forming bacteria can also cause disease : for example , anthrax can be contracted by the inhalation of bacillus anthracis endospores , and contamination of deep puncture wounds with clostridium tetani endospores causes tetanus .
the most accurate timekeeping devices are atomic clocks , which are accurate to seconds in many millions of years , and are used to calibrate other clocks and timekeeping instruments . atomic clocks use the frequency of electronic transitions in certain atoms to measure the second . one of the most common atoms used is caesium , most modern atomic clocks probe caesium with microwaves to determine the frequency of these electron vibrations . since 1967 , the international system of measurements bases its unit of time , the second , on the properties of caesium atoms . si defines the second as 9,192,631,770 cycles of the radiation that corresponds to the transition between two electron spin energy levels of the ground state of the 133cs atom .
the identification of jesus as the messiah is not accepted by judaism . the term for a christian in hebrew is נוצרי ( notzri - " nazarene " ) , a talmudic term originally derived from the fact that jesus came from the galilean village of nazareth , today in northern israel . adherents of messianic judaism are referred to in modern hebrew as יהודים משיחיים ( yehudim meshihi 'im - " messianic jews " ) .
during mubarak 's reign , the political scene was dominated by the national democratic party , which was created by sadat in 1978 . it passed the 1993 syndicates law , 1995 press law , and 1999 nongovernmental associations law which hampered freedoms of association and expression by imposing new regulations and draconian penalties on violations . [ citation needed ] as a result , by the late 1990s parliamentary politics had become virtually irrelevant and alternative avenues for political expression were curtailed as well .
rca 45s were also adapted to the smaller spindle of an lp player with a plastic snap-in insert known as a " spider . " these inserts , commissioned by rca president david sarnoff and invented by thomas hutchison , were prevalent starting in the 1960s , selling in the tens of millions per year during the 45 rpm heyday . in countries outside the u.s. , 45s often had the smaller album-sized holes , e.g. , australia and new zealand , or as in the united kingdom , especially before the 1970s , the disc had a small hole within a circular central section held only by three or four lands so that it could be easily punched out if desired ( typically for use in jukeboxes ) .
during a period of tough competition between mortgage lenders for revenue and market share , and when the supply of creditworthy borrowers was limited , mortgage lenders relaxed underwriting standards and originated riskier mortgages to less creditworthy borrowers . in the view of some analysts , the relatively conservative government-sponsored enterprises ( gses ) policed mortgage originators and maintained relatively high underwriting standards prior to 2003 . however , as market power shifted from securitizers to originators and as intense competition from private securitizers undermined gse power , mortgage standards declined and risky loans proliferated . the worst loans were originated in 2004-2007 , the years of the most intense competition between securitizers and the lowest market share for the gses .
a series of low-lying annexes ( largely hidden ) flank both ends . also in the square are the glass-faced planalto palace housing the presidential offices , and the palace of the supreme court . farther east , on a triangle of land jutting into the lake , is the palace of the dawn ( palacio da alvorada ; the presidential residence ) . between the federal and civic buildings on the monumental axis is the city 's cathedral , considered by many to be niemeyer 's finest achievement ( see photographs of the interior ) . the parabolically shaped structure is characterized by its 16 gracefully curving supports , which join in a circle 115 feet ( 35 meters ) above the floor of the nave ; stretched between the supports are translucent walls of tinted glass . the nave is entered via a subterranean passage rather than conventional doorways . other notable buildings are buriti palace , itamaraty palace , the national theater , and several foreign embassies that creatively embody features of their national architecture . the brazilian landscape architect roberto burle marx designed landmark modernist gardens for some of the principal buildings .
since 2005 , notre dame has been led by john i. jenkins , c.s.c. , the 17th president of the university . jenkins took over the position from malloy on july 1 , 2005 . in his inaugural address , jenkins described his goals of making the university a leader in research that recognizes ethics and building the connection between faith and studies . during his tenure , notre dame has increased its endowment , enlarged its student body , and undergone many construction projects on campus , including compton family ice arena , a new architecture hall , additional residence halls , and the campus crossroads , a $ 400m enhancement and expansion of notre dame stadium .
the translator 's role as a bridge for " carrying across " values between cultures has been discussed at least since terence , the 2nd-century-bce roman adapter of greek comedies . the translator 's role is , however , by no means a passive , mechanical one , and so has also been compared to that of an artist . the main ground seems to be the concept of parallel creation found in critics such as cicero . dryden observed that " translation is a type of drawing after life ... " comparison of the translator with a musician or actor goes back at least to samuel johnson 's remark about alexander pope playing homer on a flageolet , while homer himself used a bassoon .
whitehead was unimpressed by this objection . in the notes of one his students for a 1927 class , whitehead was quoted as saying : " every scientific man in order to preserve his reputation has to say he dislikes metaphysics . what he means is he dislikes having his metaphysics criticized . " in whitehead 's view , scientists and philosophers make metaphysical assumptions about how the universe works all the time , but such assumptions are not easily seen precisely because they remain unexamined and unquestioned . while whitehead acknowledged that " philosophers can never hope finally to formulate these metaphysical first principles , " he argued that people need to continually re-imagine their basic assumptions about how the universe works if philosophy and science are to make any real progress , even if that progress remains permanently asymptotic . for this reason whitehead regarded metaphysical investigations as essential to both good science and good philosophy .
being sicily 's administrative capital , palermo is a centre for much of the region 's finance , tourism and commerce . the city currently hosts an international airport , and palermo 's economic growth over the years has brought the opening of many new businesses . the economy mainly relies on tourism and services , but also has commerce , shipbuilding and agriculture . the city , however , still has high unemployment levels , high corruption and a significant black market empire ( palermo being the home of the sicilian mafia ) . even though the city still suffers from widespread corruption , inefficient bureaucracy and organized crime , the level of crime in palermo 's has gone down dramatically , unemployment has been decreasing and many new , profitable opportunities for growth ( especially regarding tourism ) have been introduced , making the city safer and better to live in .
india 's cotton-processing sector gradually declined during british expansion in india and the establishment of colonial rule during the late 18th and early 19th centuries . this was largely due to aggressive colonialist mercantile policies of the british east india company , which made cotton processing and manufacturing workshops in india uncompetitive . indian markets were increasingly forced to supply only raw cotton and , by british-imposed law , to purchase manufactured textiles from britain .

in the face of the country being re-occupied by the red army , tens of thousands of estonians ( including a majority of the education , culture , science , political and social specialists ) chose to either retreat with the germans or flee to finland or sweden where they sought refuge in other western countries , often by refugee ships such as the ss walnut . on 12 january 1949 , the soviet council of ministers issued a decree " on the expulsion and deportation " from baltic states of " all kulaks and their families , the families of bandits and nationalists , " and others .
in november , seattle averages more rainfall than any other u.s. city of more than 250,000 people ; it also ranks highly in winter precipitation . conversely , the city receives some of the lowest precipitation amounts of any large city from june to september . seattle is one of the five rainiest major u.s. cities as measured by the number of days with precipitation , and it receives some of the lowest amounts of annual sunshine among major cities in the lower 48 states , along with some cities in the northeast , ohio and michigan . thunderstorms are rare , as the city reports thunder on just seven days per year . by comparison , fort myers , florida reports thunder on 93 days per year , kansas city on 52 , and new york city on 25 .
though the music varied widely between regions and artists , the post-punk movement has been characterized by its " conceptual assault " on rock conventions and rejection of aesthetics perceived of as traditionalist , hegemonic or rockist in favor of experimentation with production techniques and non-rock musical styles such as dub , electronic music , disco , noise , jazz , krautrock , world music and the avant-garde . while post-punk musicians often avoided or intentionally obscured conventional influences , previous musical styles did serve as touchstones for the movement , including particular brands of glam , art rock and " [ the ] dark undercurrent of ' 60s music . " [ nb 1 ] according to reynolds , artists once again approached the studio as an instrument , using new recording methods and pursuing novel sonic territories . author matthew bannister wrote that post-punk artists rejected the high cultural references of 1960s rock artists like the beatles and bob dylan as well as paradigms that defined " rock as progressive , as art , as ' sterile ' studio perfectionism ... by adopting an avant-garde aesthetic . "
human activities are more likely to affect the habitat in areas of permanent water ( oases ) or where water comes close to the surface . here , the local pressure on natural resources can be intense . the remaining populations of large mammals have been greatly reduced by hunting for food and recreation . in recent years development projects have started in the deserts of algeria and tunisia using irrigated water pumped from underground aquifers . these schemes often lead to soil degradation and salinization .
in 1911 arsphenamine , the first synthetic anti-infective drug , was developed by paul ehrlich and chemist alfred bertheim of the institute of experimental therapy in berlin . the drug was given the commercial name salvarsan . ehrlich , noting both the general toxicity of arsenic and the selective absorption of certain dyes by bacteria , hypothesized that an arsenic-containing dye with similar selective absorption properties could be used to treat bacterial infections . arsphenamine was prepared as part of a campaign to synthesize a series of such compounds , and found to exhibit partially selective toxicity . arsphenamine proved to be the first effective treatment for syphilis , a disease which prior to that time was incurable and led inexorably to severe skin ulceration , neurological damage , and death .

the issue of the parentage of jesus in the talmud affects also the view of his mother . however the talmud does not mention mary by name and is considerate rather than only polemic . the story about panthera is also found in the toledot yeshu , the literary origins of which can not be traced with any certainty and given that it is unlikely to go before the 4th century , it is far too late to include authentic remembrances of jesus . the blackwell companion to jesus states that the toledot yeshu has no historical facts as such , and was perhaps created as a tool for warding off conversions to christianity . the name panthera may be a distortion of the term parthenos ( virgin ) and raymond e. brown considers the story of panthera a fanciful explanation of the birth of jesus which includes very little historical evidence . robert van voorst states that given that toledot yeshu is a medieval document and due to its lack of a fixed form and orientation towards a popular audience , it is " most unlikely " to have reliable historical information .
bird migration is not limited to birds that can fly . most species of penguin ( spheniscidae ) migrate by swimming . these routes can cover over 1,000 km ( 620 mi ) . dusky grouse dendragapus obscurus perform altitudinal migration mostly by walking . emus dromaius novaehollandiae in australia have been observed to undertake long-distance movements on foot during droughts .
in 14th-century england , hound ( from old english : hund ) was the general word for all domestic canines , and dog referred to a subtype of hound , a group including the mastiff . it is believed this " dog " type was so common , it eventually became the prototype of the category " hound . " by the 16th century , dog had become the general word , and hound had begun to refer only to types used for hunting . the word " hound " is ultimately derived from the proto-indo-european word * kwon- " dog . "
rendering software which cannot process a unicode character appropriately often displays it as an open rectangle , or the unicode " replacement character " ( u + fffd , � ) , to indicate the position of the unrecognized character . some systems have made attempts to provide more information about such characters . the apple 's last resort font will display a substitute glyph indicating the unicode range of the character , and the sil international 's unicode fallback font will display a box showing the hexadecimal scalar value of the character .
in 2009 , the university 's marriott school of management received a no. 5 ranking by businessweek for its undergraduate programs , and its mba program was ranked by several sources : no. 22 ranking by businessweek , no. 16 by forbes , and no. 29 by u.s. news & world report . among regional schools the mba program was ranked no. 1 by the wall street journal 's most recent ranking ( 2007 ) , and it was ranked no. 92 among business schools worldwide in 2009 by financial times . for 2009 , the university 's school of accountancy , which is housed within the marriott school , received two no. 3 rankings for its undergraduate program - one by public accounting report and the other by u.s. news & world report . the same two reporting agencies also ranked the school 's macc program no. 3 and no. 8 in the nation , respectively . in 2010 , an article in the wall street journal listing institutions whose graduates were the top-rated by recruiters ranked byu no. 11 . using 2010 fiscal year data , the association of university technology managers ranked byu no. 3 in an evaluation of universities creating the most startup companies through campus research .

on 1 may , the sun claimed to have ' sponsored ' a british missile . under the headline " stick this up your junta : a sun missile for galtieri 's gauchos , " the newspaper published a photograph of a missile , ( actually a polaris missile stock shot from the ministry of defence ) which had a large sun logo printed on its side with the caption " here it comes , senors ... " underneath . the paper explained that it was ' sponsoring ' the missile by contributing to the eventual victory party on hms invincible when the war ended . in copy written by wendy henry , the paper said that the missile would shortly be used against argentinian forces . despite this , it was not well received by the troops and copies of the sun were soon burnt . tony snow , the sun journalist on hms invincible who had ' signed ' the missile , reported a few days later that it had hit an argentinian target .
in a conventional lamp , the evaporated tungsten eventually condenses on the inner surface of the glass envelope , darkening it . for bulbs that contain a vacuum , the darkening is uniform across the entire surface of the envelope . when a filling of inert gas is used , the evaporated tungsten is carried in the thermal convection currents of the gas , depositing preferentially on the uppermost part of the envelope and blackening just that portion of the envelope . an incandescent lamp that gives 93 % or less of its initial light output at 75 % of its rated life is regarded as unsatisfactory , when tested according to iec publication 60064 . light loss is due to filament evaporation and bulb blackening . study of the problem of bulb blackening led to the discovery of the edison effect , thermionic emission and invention of the vacuum tube .
doctrines of jehovah 's witnesses are established by the governing body . the religion does not tolerate dissent over doctrines and practices ; members who openly disagree with the religion 's teachings are expelled and shunned . witness publications strongly discourage followers from questioning doctrine and counsel received from the governing body , reasoning that it is to be trusted as part of " god 's organization . " it also warns members to " avoid independent thinking , " claiming such thinking " was introduced by satan the devil " and would " cause division . " those who openly disagree with official teachings are condemned as " apostates " who are " mentally diseased . "
the first " free election " ( polish : " wolna elekcja " ) of a king took place in 1492 . ( to be sure , some earlier polish kings had been elected with help from bodies such as that which put casimir ii on the throne , thereby setting a precedent for free elections . ) only senators voted in the 1492 free election , which was won by john i albert . for the duration of the jagiellonian dynasty , only members of that royal family were considered for election ; later , there would be no restrictions on the choice of candidates .
between january and may 1673 , the dutch east india company forcibly took the island , before english reinforcements restored english east india company control . the company experienced difficulty attracting new immigrants , and sentiments of unrest and rebellion fomented among the inhabitants . ecological problems , including deforestation , soil erosion , vermin and drought , led governor isaac pyke to suggest in 1715 that the population be moved to mauritius , but this was not acted upon and the company continued to subsidise the community because of the island 's strategic location . a census in 1723 recorded 1,110 people , including 610 slaves .
presbyterianism is historically a confessional tradition . this has two implications . the obvious one is that confessional churches express their faith in the form of " confessions of faith , " which have some level of authoritative status . however this is based on a more subtle point : in confessional churches , theology is not solely an individual matter . while individuals are encouraged to understand scripture , and may challenge the current institutional understanding , theology is carried out by the community as a whole . it is this community understanding of theology that is expressed in confessions .
engineering achievements of the revolution ranged from electrification to developments in materials science . the advancements made a great contribution to the quality of life . in the first revolution , lewis paul was the original inventor of roller spinning , the basis of the water frame for spinning cotton in a cotton mill . matthew boulton and james watt 's improvements to the steam engine were fundamental to the changes brought by the industrial revolution in both the kingdom of great britain and the world .
in the somali diaspora , multiple islamic fundraising events are held every year in cities like birmingham , london , toronto and minneapolis , where somali scholars and professionals give lectures and answer questions from the audience . the purpose of these events is usually to raise money for new schools or universities in somalia , to help somalis that have suffered as a consequence of floods and / or droughts , or to gather funds for the creation of new mosques like the abuubakar-as-saddique mosque , which is currently undergoing construction in the twin cities .
details of school casualties had been under non-governmental investigation since december 2008 by volunteers including artist and architect ai weiwei , who had been constantly posting updates on his blog since march 2009 . the official tally of students killed in the earthquake was not released until may 7 , 2009 , almost a year after the earthquake . according to the state-run xinhua news agency , the earthquake killed 5,335 students and left another 546 children disabled . in the aftermath of the earthquake , the chinese government declared that parents who had lost their only children would get free treatment from fertility clinics to reverse vasectomies and tubal ligations conducted by family planning authorities .
the triassic was generally dry , a trend that began in the late carboniferous , and highly seasonal , especially in the interior of pangaea . low sea levels may have also exacerbated temperature extremes . with its high specific heat capacity , water acts as a temperature-stabilizing heat reservoir , and land areas near large bodies of water - especially the oceans - experience less variation in temperature . because much of the land that constituted pangaea was distant from the oceans , temperatures fluctuated greatly , and the interior of pangaea probably included expansive areas of desert . abundant red beds and evaporites such as halite support these conclusions , but evidence exists that the generally dry climate of the triassic was punctuated by episodes of increased rainfall . most important humid episodes were the carnian pluvial event and one in the rhaetian , few million years before the triassic-jurassic extinction event .
starting in the 1970s , the bronx often symbolized violence , decay , and urban ruin . the wave of arson in the south bronx in the 1960s and 1970s inspired the observation that " the bronx is burning " : in 1974 it was the title of both a new york times editorial and a bbc documentary film . the line entered the pop-consciousness with game two of the 1977 world series , when a fire broke out near yankee stadium as the team was playing the los angeles dodgers . numerous fires had previously broken out in the bronx prior to this fire . as the fire was captured on live television , announcer howard cosell is wrongly remembered to have said something like , " there it is , ladies and gentlemen : the bronx is burning . " historians of new york city frequently point to cosell 's remark as an acknowledgement of both the city and the borough 's decline . a new feature-length documentary film by edwin pagan called bronx burning is in production in 2006 , chronicling what led up to the numerous arson-for-insurance fraud fires of the 1970s in the borough .
being sicily 's administrative capital , palermo is a centre for much of the region 's finance , tourism and commerce . the city currently hosts an international airport , and palermo 's economic growth over the years has brought the opening of many new businesses . the economy mainly relies on tourism and services , but also has commerce , shipbuilding and agriculture . the city , however , still has high unemployment levels , high corruption and a significant black market empire ( palermo being the home of the sicilian mafia ) . even though the city still suffers from widespread corruption , inefficient bureaucracy and organized crime , the level of crime in palermo 's has gone down dramatically , unemployment has been decreasing and many new , profitable opportunities for growth ( especially regarding tourism ) have been introduced , making the city safer and better to live in .
in 1664 , peter stuyvesant , the director-general of the colony of new netherland , surrendered new amsterdam to the english without bloodshed . the english promptly renamed the fledgling city " new york " after the duke of york ( later king james ii ) .
a developed country with an advanced , high-income economy and high living standards , estonia ranks very high in the human development index , and performs favourably in measurements of economic freedom , civil liberties , education , and press freedom ( third in the world in 2012 ) . estonia has been among the fastest growing economies in the european union and is a part of the world trade organization and the nordic investment bank . estonia is often described as one of the most internet-focused countries in europe .
for example , at 30 mhz ( 10 m wavelength ) a true resonant 1 ⁄ 4-wavelength monopole would be almost 2.5 meters long , and using an antenna only 1.5 meters tall would require the addition of a loading coil . then it may be said that the coil has lengthened the antenna to achieve an electrical length of 2.5 meters . however , the resulting resistive impedance achieved will be quite a bit lower than the impedance of a resonant monopole , likely requiring further impedance matching . in addition to a lower radiation resistance , the reactance becomes higher as the antenna size is reduced , and the resonant circuit formed by the antenna and the tuning coil has a q factor that rises and eventually causes the bandwidth of the antenna to be inadequate for the signal being transmitted . this is the major factor that sets the size of antennas at 1 mhz and lower frequencies .
as with any other country during the early modern period , such as italy and spain in europe , the ottoman social life was interconnected with the medrese . medreses were built in as part of a mosque complex where many programmes , such as aid to the poor through soup kitchens , were held under the infrastructure of a mosque , which reveals the interconnectedness of religion and social life during this period . " the mosques to which medreses were attached , dominated the social life in ottoman cities . " social life was not dominated by religion only in the muslim world of the ottoman empire ; it was also quite similar to the social life of europe during this period . as goffman says : " just as mosques dominated social life for the ottomans , churches and synagogues dominated life for the christians and jews as well . " hence , social life and the medrese were closely linked , since medreses taught many curricula , such as religion , which highly governed social life in terms of establishing orthodoxy . " they tried moving their developing state toward islamic orthodoxy . " overall , the fact that mosques contained medreses comes to show the relevance of education to religion in the sense that education took place within the framework of religion and religion established social life by trying to create a common religious orthodoxy . hence , medreses were simply part of the social life of society as students came to learn the fundamentals of their societal values and beliefs .
at the turn of the 21st century , a post-punk revival developed in british and american alternative and indie rock , which soon started appearing in other countries , as well . the earliest sign of a revival was the emergence of various underground bands in the mid- ' 90s . however , the first commercially successful bands - the strokes , franz ferdinand , interpol , neils children and editors - surfaced in the late 1990s to early 2000s , as did several dance-oriented bands such as the rapture , radio 4 and lcd soundsystem . additionally , some darker post-punk bands began to appear in the indie music scene in the 2010s , including cold cave , she wants revenge , eagulls , the soft moon , she past away and light asylum , who were also affiliated with the darkwave revival , as well as a place to bury strangers , who combined early post-punk and shoegaze . these bands tend to draw a fanbase who are a combination of the indie music subculture , older post-punk fans and the current goth subculture . in the 2010s , savages played a music reminiscent of early british post-punk bands of the late ' 70s .
freedom of the press is ostensibly officially guaranteed by the government , but independent press outlets remain restricted , as does a substantial amount of web content . according to the institute for war & peace reporting , access is blocked to local and foreign websites including avesta.tj , tjknews.com , ferghana.ru , centrasia.ru and journalists are often obstructed from reporting on controversial events . in practice , no public criticism of the regime is tolerated and all direct protest is severely suppressed and does not receive coverage in the local media .
rheinmetall in germany developed an automatic 20 mm in the 1920s and oerlikon in switzerland had acquired the patent to an automatic 20 mm gun designed in germany during world war i. germany introduced the rapid-fire 2 cm flak 30 and later in the decade it was redesigned by mauser-werke and became the 2 cm flak 38 . nevertheless , while 20 mm was better than a machine gun and mounted on a very small trailer made it easy to move , its effectiveness was limited . germany therefore added a 3.7 cm . the first , the 3.7 cm flak 18 developed by rheinmetall in the early 1930s , was basically an enlarged 2 cm flak 30 . it was introduced in 1935 and production stopped the following year . a redesigned gun 3.7 cm flak 36 entered service in 1938 , it too had a two-wheel carriage . however , by the mid-1930s the luftwaffe realised that there was still a coverage gap between 3.7 cm and 8.8 cm guns . they started development of a 5 cm gun on a four-wheel carriage .
miami is partitioned into many different sections , roughly into north , south , west and downtown . the heart of the city is downtown miami and is technically on the eastern side of the city . this area includes brickell , virginia key , watson island , and portmiami . downtown is south florida 's central business district , and florida 's largest and most influential central business district . downtown has the largest concentration of international banks in the u.s. along brickell avenue . downtown is home to many major banks , courthouses , financial headquarters , cultural and tourist attractions , schools , parks and a large residential population . east of downtown , across biscayne bay is south beach . just northwest of downtown , is the civic center , which is miami 's center for hospitals , research institutes and biotechnology with hospitals such as jackson memorial hospital , miami va hospital , and the university of miami 's leonard m. miller school of medicine .
animals are also involved in the distribution of seeds . fruit , which is formed by the enlargement of flower parts , is frequently a seed-dispersal tool that attracts animals to eat or otherwise disturb it , incidentally scattering the seeds it contains ( see frugivory ) . although many such mutualistic relationships remain too fragile to survive competition and to spread widely , flowering proved to be an unusually effective means of reproduction , spreading ( whatever its origin ) to become the dominant form of land plant life .
the boudhanath , ( also written bouddhanath , bodhnath , baudhanath or the khasa chaitya ) , is one of the holiest buddhist sites in nepal , along with swayambhu . it is a very popular tourist site . boudhanath is known as khasti by newars and as bauddha or bodhnath by speakers of nepali . located about 11 km ( 7 mi ) from the center and northeastern outskirts of kathmandu , the stupa 's massive mandala makes it one of the largest spherical stupas in nepal . boudhanath became a unesco world heritage site in 1979 .
most notably , there was also a secret protocol to the pact , revealed only after germany 's defeat in 1945 , although hints about its provisions were leaked much earlier , e.g. , to influence lithuania . according to said protocol romania , poland , lithuania , latvia , estonia and finland were divided into german and soviet " spheres of influence . " in the north , finland , estonia and latvia were assigned to the soviet sphere . poland was to be partitioned in the event of its " political rearrangement " - the areas east of the pisa , narev , vistula and san rivers going to the soviet union while germany would occupy the west . lithuania , adjacent to east prussia , would be in the german sphere of influence , although a second secret protocol agreed to in september 1939 reassigned the majority of lithuania to the ussr . according to the secret protocol , lithuania would be granted the city of vilnius - its historical capital , which was under polish control during the inter-war period . another clause of the treaty was that germany would not interfere with the soviet union 's actions towards bessarabia , then part of romania ; as the result , bessarabia was joined to the moldovan assr , and become the moldovan ssr under control of moscow .
the most popular korean dog dish is gaejang-guk ( also called bosintang ) , a spicy stew meant to balance the body 's heat during the summer months ; followers of the custom claim this is done to ensure good health by balancing one 's gi , or vital energy of the body . a 19th century version of gaejang-guk explains that the dish is prepared by boiling dog meat with scallions and chili powder . variations of the dish contain chicken and bamboo shoots . while the dishes are still popular in korea with a segment of the population , dog is not as widely consumed as beef , chicken , and pork .
as of 2010 , those of african ancestry accounted for 16.0 % of florida 's population , which includes african americans . out of the 16.0 % , 4.0 % ( 741,879 ) were west indian or afro-caribbean american . during the early 1900s , black people made up nearly half of the state 's population . in response to segregation , disfranchisement and agricultural depression , many african americans migrated from florida to northern cities in the great migration , in waves from 1910 to 1940 , and again starting in the later 1940s . they moved for jobs , better education for their children and the chance to vote and participate in society . by 1960 the proportion of african americans in the state had declined to 18 % . conversely large numbers of northern whites moved to the state . [ citation needed ] today , large concentrations of black residents can be found in northern and central florida . aside from blacks descended from african slaves brought to the us south , there are also large numbers of blacks of west indian , recent african , and afro-latino immigrant origins , especially in the miami / south florida area . in 2010 , florida had the highest percentage of west indians in the united states , with 2.0 % ( 378,926 ) from haitian ancestry , and 1.3 % ( 236,950 ) jamaican . all other ( non-hispanic ) caribbean nations were well below 0.1 % of florida residents .
in 2012 , the modern use of electronic educational technology ( also called e-learning ) had grown at 14 times the rate of traditional learning . [ clarification needed ] open education is fast growing to become the dominant form of education , for many reasons such as its efficiency and results compared to traditional methods . cost of education has been an issue throughout history , and a major political issue in most countries today . online courses often can be more expensive than face-to-face classes . out of 182 colleges surveyed in 2009 nearly half said tuition for online courses was higher than for campus based ones . many large university institutions are now starting to offer free or almost free full courses such as harvard , mit and berkeley teaming up to form edx . other universities offering open education are stanford , princeton , duke , johns hopkins , edinburgh , u. penn , u. michigan , u. virginia , u. washington , and caltech . it has been called the biggest change in the way we learn since the printing press . despite favorable studies on effectiveness , many people may still desire to choose traditional campus education for social and cultural reasons .
another model is the feels model developed by xie bangxiu and deployed successfully in china . " feels " stands for five things in curriculum and education : flexible-goals , engaged-learner , embodied-knowledge , learning-through-interactions , and supportive-teacher . it is used for understanding and evaluating educational curriculum under the assumption that the purpose of education is to " help a person become whole . " this work is in part the product of cooperation between chinese government organizations and the institute for the postmodern development of china .
the west end of these streets is bowery and third avenue , except for 3rd street ( formerly amity place ; to sixth avenue ) and 4th street ( to 13th street ) , which extend west and north , respectively , into greenwich village . great jones street connects east 3rd to west 3rd .
developerworks is a website run by ibm for software developers and it professionals . it contains how-to articles and tutorials , as well as software downloads and code samples , discussion forums , podcasts , blogs , wikis , and other resources for developers and technical professionals . subjects range from open , industry-standard technologies like java , linux , soa and web services , web development , ajax , php , and xml to ibm 's products ( websphere , rational , lotus , tivoli and information management ) . in 2007 , developerworks was inducted into the jolt hall of fame .
roman catholicism was the sole established religion in the holy roman empire until the reformation changed this drastically . in 1517 , martin luther challenged the catholic church as he saw it as a corruption of christian faith . through this , he altered the course of european and world history and established protestantism . the thirty years ' war ( 1618-1648 ) was one of the most destructive conflicts in european history . the war was fought primarily in what is now germany , and at various points involved most of the countries of europe . the war was fought largely as a religious conflict between protestants and catholics in the holy roman empire .
puppetry and shadow plays were also a favoured form of entertainment in past centuries , a famous one being wayang from indonesia . the arts and literature in some of southeast asia is quite influenced by hinduism , which was brought to them centuries ago . indonesia , despite conversion to islam which opposes certain forms of art , has retained many forms of hindu-influenced practices , culture , art and literature . an example is the wayang kulit ( shadow puppet ) and literature like the ramayana . the wayang kulit show has been recognized by unesco on november 7 , 2003 , as a masterpiece of oral and intangible heritage of humanity .
the yale report of 1828 was a dogmatic defense of the latin and greek curriculum against critics who wanted more courses in modern languages , mathematics , and science . unlike higher education in europe , there was no national curriculum for colleges and universities in the united states . in the competition for students and financial support , college leaders strove to keep current with demands for innovation . at the same time , they realized that a significant portion of their students and prospective students demanded a classical background . the yale report meant the classics would not be abandoned . all institutions experimented with changes in the curriculum , often resulting in a dual track . in the decentralized environment of higher education in the united states , balancing change with tradition was a common challenge because no one could afford to be completely modern or completely classical . a group of professors at yale and new haven congregationalist ministers articulated a conservative response to the changes brought about by the victorian culture . they concentrated on developing a whole man possessed of religious values sufficiently strong to resist temptations from within , yet flexible enough to adjust to the ' isms ' ( professionalism , materialism , individualism , and consumerism ) tempting him from without . william graham sumner , professor from 1872 to 1909 , taught in the emerging disciplines of economics and sociology to overflowing classrooms . he bested president noah porter , who disliked social science and wanted yale to lock into its traditions of classical education . porter objected to sumner 's use of a textbook by herbert spencer that espoused agnostic materialism because it might harm students .
lasers emitting in the green part of the spectrum are widely available to the general public in a wide range of output powers . green laser pointers outputting at 532 nm ( 563.5 thz ) are relatively inexpensive compared to other wavelengths of the same power , and are very popular due to their good beam quality and very high apparent brightness . the most common green lasers use diode pumped solid state ( dpss ) technology to create the green light . an infrared laser diode at 808 nm is used to pump a crystal of neodymium-doped yttrium vanadium oxide ( nd : yvo4 ) or neodymium-doped yttrium aluminium garnet ( nd : yag ) and induces it to emit 281.76 thz ( 1064 nm ) . this deeper infrared light is then passed through another crystal containing potassium , titanium and phosphorus ( ktp ) , whose non-linear properties generate light at a frequency that is twice that of the incident beam ( 563.5 thz ) ; in this case corresponding to the wavelength of 532 nm ( " green " ) . other green wavelengths are also available using dpss technology ranging from 501 nm to 543 nm . green wavelengths are also available from gas lasers , including the helium-neon laser ( 543 nm ) , the argon-ion laser ( 514 nm ) and the krypton-ion laser ( 521 nm and 531 nm ) , as well as liquid dye lasers . green lasers have a wide variety of applications , including pointing , illumination , surgery , laser light shows , spectroscopy , interferometry , fluorescence , holography , machine vision , non-lethal weapons and bird control .
during its formative period , the term madrasah referred to a higher education institution , whose curriculum initially included only the " religious sciences , " whilst philosophy and the secular sciences were often excluded . the curriculum slowly began to diversify , with many later madaris teaching both the religious and the " secular sciences , " such as logic , mathematics and philosophy . some madaris further extended their curriculum to history , politics , ethics , music , metaphysics , medicine , astronomy and chemistry . the curriculum of a madrasah was usually set by its founder , but most generally taught both the religious sciences and the physical sciences . madaris were established throughout the islamic world , examples being the 9th century university of al-qarawiyyin , the 10th century al-azhar university ( the most famous ) , the 11th century nizamiyah , as well as 75 madaris in cairo , 51 in damascus and up to 44 in aleppo between 1155 and 1260 . many more were also established in the andalusian cities of cordoba , seville , toledo , granada ( madrasah of granada ) , murcia , almeria , valencia and cadiz during the caliphate of cordoba .
house music is a genre of electronic dance music that originated in chicago in the early 1980s . it was initially popularized in chicago , circa 1984 . house music quickly spread to other american cities such as detroit , new york city , and newark - all of which developed their own regional scenes . in the mid-to-late 1980s , house music became popular in europe as well as major cities in south america , and australia . early house music commercial success in europe saw songs such as " pump up the volume " by marrs ( 1987 ) , " house nation " by house master boyz and the rude boy of house ( 1987 ) , " theme from s 'express " by s 'express ( 1988 ) and " doctorin ' the house " by coldcut ( 1988 ) in the pop charts . since the early to mid-1990s , house music has been infused in mainstream pop and dance music worldwide .
the first digimon anime introduced the digimon life cycle : they age in a similar fashion to real organisms , but do not die under normal circumstances because they are made of reconfigurable data , which can be seen throughout the show . any digimon that receives a fatal wound will dissolve into infinitesimal bits of data . the data then recomposes itself as a digi-egg , which will hatch when rubbed gently , and the digimon goes through its life cycle again . digimon who are reincarnated in this way will sometimes retain some or all their memories of their previous life . however , if a digimon 's data is completely destroyed , they will die .
social predation offers the possibility of predators to kill creatures larger than those that members of the species could overpower singly . lions , hyenas , wolves , dholes , african wild dogs , and piranhas can kill large herbivores that single animals of the same species usually don 't dispatch . social predation allows some animals to organize hunts of creatures that would easily escape a single predator ; thus chimpanzees can prey upon colobus monkeys , and harris 's hawks can cut off all possible escapes for a doomed rabbit . extreme specialization of roles is evident in some hunting that requires co-operation between predators of very different species : humans with the aid of falcons or dogs , or fishing with cormorants . social predation is often very complex behavior , and not all social creatures ( for example , domestic cats ) perform it . even without complex intelligence but instinct alone , some ant species can destroy much larger creatures .
a glacier ( us / ˈɡleɪʃər / or uk / ˈɡlæsiə / ) is a persistent body of dense ice that is constantly moving under its own weight ; it forms where the accumulation of snow exceeds its ablation ( melting and sublimation ) over many years , often centuries . glaciers slowly deform and flow due to stresses induced by their weight , creating crevasses , seracs , and other distinguishing features . they also abrade rock and debris from their substrate to create landforms such as cirques and moraines . glaciers form only on land and are distinct from the much thinner sea ice and lake ice that form on the surface of bodies of water .
today , nearly all commonly used video compression methods ( e.g. , those in standards approved by the itu-t or iso ) apply a discrete cosine transform ( dct ) for spatial redundancy reduction . the dct that is widely used in this regard was introduced by n. ahmed , t. natarajan and k. r. rao in 1974 . other methods , such as fractal compression , matching pursuit and the use of a discrete wavelet transform ( dwt ) have been the subject of some research , but are typically not used in practical products ( except for the use of wavelet coding as still-image coders without motion compensation ) . interest in fractal compression seems to be waning , due to recent theoretical analysis showing a comparative lack of effectiveness of such methods .
a p-n junction can convert absorbed light energy into a proportional electric current . the same process is reversed here ( i.e. the p-n junction emits light when electrical energy is applied to it ) . this phenomenon is generally called electroluminescence , which can be defined as the emission of light from a semi-conductor under the influence of an electric field . the charge carriers recombine in a forward-biased p-n junction as the electrons cross from the n-region and recombine with the holes existing in the p-region . free electrons are in the conduction band of energy levels , while holes are in the valence energy band . thus the energy level of the holes will be lesser than the energy levels of the electrons . some portion of the energy must be dissipated in order to recombine the electrons and the holes . this energy is emitted in the form of heat and light .
boston has been a noted religious center from its earliest days . the roman catholic archdiocese of boston serves nearly 300 parishes and is based in the cathedral of the holy cross ( 1875 ) in the south end , while the episcopal diocese of massachusetts , with the cathedral church of st. paul ( 1819 ) as its episcopal seat , serves just under 200 congregations . unitarian universalism has its headquarters on beacon hill . the christian scientists are headquartered in back bay at the mother church ( 1894 ) . the oldest church in boston is first church in boston , founded in 1630 . king 's chapel , the city 's first anglican church , was founded in 1686 and converted to unitarianism in 1785 . other churches include christ church ( better known as old north church , 1723 ) , the oldest church building in the city , trinity church ( 1733 ) , park street church ( 1809 ) , old south church ( 1874 ) , jubilee christian church and basilica and shrine of our lady of perpetual help on mission hill ( 1878 ) .
most bacteria have a single circular chromosome that can range in size from only 160,000 base pairs in the endosymbiotic bacteria candidatus carsonella ruddii , to 12,200,000 base pairs in the soil-dwelling bacteria sorangium cellulosum . spirochaetes of the genus borrelia are a notable exception to this arrangement , with bacteria such as borrelia burgdorferi , the cause of lyme disease , containing a single linear chromosome . the genes in bacterial genomes are usually a single continuous stretch of dna and although several different types of introns do exist in bacteria , these are much rarer than in eukaryotes .
beyonce has been described as a having a wide-ranging sex appeal , with music journalist toure writing that since the release of dangerously in love , she has " become a crossover sex symbol . " offstage beyonce says that while she likes to dress sexily , her onstage dress " is absolutely for the stage . " due to her curves and the term 's catchiness , in the 2000s , the media often used the term " bootylicious " ( a portmanteau of the words booty and delicious ) to describe beyonce , the term popularized by destiny 's child 's single of the same name . in 2006 , it was added to the oxford english dictionary .
the san diego surf of the american basketball association is located in the city . the annual farmers insurance open golf tournament ( formerly the buick invitational ) on the pga tour occurs at torrey pines golf course . this course was also the site of the 2008 u.s. open golf championship . the san diego yacht club hosted the america 's cup yacht races three times during the period 1988 to 1995 . the amateur beach sport over-the-line was invented in san diego , and the annual world over-the-line championships are held at mission bay every year .
greece is strategically located at the crossroads of europe , asia , and africa . situated on the southern tip of the balkan peninsula , it shares land borders with albania to the northwest , the republic of macedonia and bulgaria to the north and turkey to the northeast . greece consists of nine geographic regions : macedonia , central greece , the peloponnese , thessaly , epirus , the aegean islands ( including the dodecanese and cyclades ) , thrace , crete , and the ionian islands . the aegean sea lies to the east of the mainland , the ionian sea to the west , and the mediterranean sea to the south . greece has the longest coastline on the mediterranean basin and the 11th longest coastline in the world at 13,676 km ( 8,498 mi ) in length , featuring a vast number of islands , of which 227 are inhabited . eighty percent of greece is mountainous , with mount olympus being the highest peak at 2,918 metres ( 9,573 ft ) .
pitt 's act was deemed a failure because it quickly became apparent that the boundaries between government control and the company 's powers were nebulous and highly subjective . the government felt obliged to respond to humanitarian calls for better treatment of local peoples in british-occupied territories . edmund burke , a former east india company shareholder and diplomat , was moved to address the situation and introduced a new regulating bill in 1783 . the bill was defeated amid lobbying by company loyalists and accusations of nepotism in the bill 's recommendations for the appointment of councillors .
in november 2003 , she embarked on the dangerously in love tour in europe and later toured alongside missy elliott and alicia keys for the verizon ladies first tour in north america . on february 1 , 2004 , beyonce performed the american national anthem at super bowl xxxviii , at the reliant stadium in houston , texas . after the release of dangerously in love , beyonce had planned to produce a follow-up album using several of the left-over tracks . however , this was put on hold so she could concentrate on recording destiny fulfilled , the final studio album by destiny 's child . released on november 15 , 2004 , in the us and peaking at number two on the billboard 200 , destiny fulfilled included the singles " lose my breath " and " soldier , " which reached the top five on the billboard hot 100 chart . destiny 's child embarked on a worldwide concert tour , destiny fulfilled ... and lovin ' it and during the last stop of their european tour , in barcelona on june 11 , 2005 , rowland announced that destiny 's child would disband following the north american leg of the tour . the group released their first compilation album number 1 's on october 25 , 2005 , in the us and accepted a star on the hollywood walk of fame in march 2006 .
the pagan slavic populations were christianized between the 6th and 10th centuries . orthodox christianity is predominant in the east and south slavs , while roman catholicism is predominant in west slavs and the western south slavs . the religious borders are largely comparable to the east-west schism which began in the 11th century . the majority of contemporary slavic populations who profess a religion are orthodox , followed by catholic , while a small minority are protestant . there are minor slavic muslim groups . religious delineations by nationality can be very sharp ; usually in the slavic ethnic groups the vast majority of religious people share the same religion . some slavs are atheist or agnostic : only 19 % of czechs professed belief in god / s in the 2005 eurobarometer survey .
the traditional new york area accent is characterized as non-rhotic , so that the sound [ ɹ ] does not appear at the end of a syllable or immediately before a consonant ; hence the pronunciation of the city name as " new yawk . " there is no [ ɹ ] in words like park [ pɑək ] or [ pɒək ] ( with vowel backed and diphthongized due to the low-back chain shift ) , butter [ bʌɾə ] , or here [ hiə ] . in another feature called the low back chain shift , the [ ɔ ] vowel sound of words like talk , law , cross , chocolate , and coffee and the often homophonous [ ɔr ] in core and more are tensed and usually raised more than in general american . in the most old-fashioned and extreme versions of the new york dialect , the vowel sounds of words like " girl " and of words like " oil " became a diphthong [ ɜɪ ] . this would often be misperceived by speakers of other accents as a reversal of the er and oy sounds , so that girl is pronounced " goil " and oil is pronounced " erl " ; this leads to the caricature of new yorkers saying things like " joizey " ( jersey ) , " toidy-toid street " ( 33rd st. ) and " terlet " ( toilet ) . the character archie bunker from the 1970s sitcom all in the family ( played by carroll o 'connor ) was a notable example of having used this pattern of speech , which continues to fade in its overall presence .
waitz defined anthropology as " the science of the nature of man . " by nature he meant matter animated by " the divine breath " ; i.e. , he was an animist . following broca 's lead , waitz points out that anthropology is a new field , which would gather material from other fields , but would differ from them in the use of comparative anatomy , physiology , and psychology to differentiate man from " the animals nearest to him . " he stresses that the data of comparison must be empirical , gathered by experimentation . the history of civilization as well as ethnology are to be brought into the comparison . it is to be presumed fundamentally that the species , man , is a unity , and that " the same laws of thought are applicable to all men . "
there are many non-incandescent light sources , such as the fluorescent lamp , high-intensity discharge lamps and led lamps , which have higher luminous efficiency , and some have been designed to be retrofitted in fixtures for incandescent lights . these devices produce light by luminescence . these lamps produce discrete spectral lines and do not have the broad " tail " of invisible infrared emissions . by careful selection of which electron energy level transitions are used , and fluorescent coatings which modify the spectral distribution , the spectrum emitted can be tuned to mimic the appearance of incandescent sources , or other different color temperatures of white light . due to the discrete spectral lines rather than a continuous spectrum , the light is not ideal for applications such as photography and cinematography .
state law codifies oklahoma 's state emblems and honorary positions ; the oklahoma senate or house of representatives may adopt resolutions designating others for special events and to benefit organizations . currently the state senate is waiting to vote on a change to the state 's motto . the house passed hcr 1024 , which will change the state motto from " labor omnia vincit " to " oklahoma-in god we trust ! " the author of the resolution stated that a constituent researched the oklahoma constitution and found no " official " vote regarding " labor omnia vincit , " therefore opening the door for an entirely new motto .
before the early 20th century , treatments for infections were based primarily on medicinal folklore . mixtures with antimicrobial properties that were used in treatments of infections were described over 2000 years ago . many ancient cultures , including the ancient egyptians and ancient greeks , used specially selected mold and plant materials and extracts to treat infections . more recent observations made in the laboratory of antibiosis between microorganisms led to the discovery of natural antibacterials produced by microorganisms . louis pasteur observed , " if we could intervene in the antagonism observed between some bacteria , it would offer perhaps the greatest hopes for therapeutics . " the term ' antibiosis ' , meaning " against life , " was introduced by the french bacteriologist jean paul vuillemin as a descriptive name of the phenomenon exhibited by these early antibacterial drugs . antibiosis was first described in 1877 in bacteria when louis pasteur and robert koch observed that an airborne bacillus could inhibit the growth of bacillus anthracis . these drugs were later renamed antibiotics by selman waksman , an american microbiologist , in 1942 . synthetic antibiotic chemotherapy as a science and development of antibacterials began in germany with paul ehrlich in the late 1880s . ehrlich noted certain dyes would color human , animal , or bacterial cells , whereas others did not . he then proposed the idea that it might be possible to create chemicals that would act as a selective drug that would bind to and kill bacteria without harming the human host . after screening hundreds of dyes against various organisms , in 1907 , he discovered a medicinally useful drug , the synthetic antibacterial salvarsan now called arsphenamine .
in contrast to this viewpoint , an article and associated editorial in the new england journal of medicine in may 2015 emphasized the importance of pharmaceutical industry-physician interactions for the development of novel treatments , and argued that moral outrage over industry malfeasance had unjustifiably led many to overemphasize the problems created by financial conflicts of interest . the article noted that major healthcare organizations such as national center for advancing translational sciences of the national institutes of health , the president 's council of advisors on science and technology , the world economic forum , the gates foundation , the wellcome trust , and the food and drug administration had encouraged greater interactions between physicians and industry in order to bring greater benefits to patients .
sub- and quotient groups are related in the following way : a subset h of g can be seen as an injective map h → g , i.e. any element of the target has at most one element that maps to it . the counterpart to injective maps are surjective maps ( every element of the target is mapped onto ) , such as the canonical map g → g / n.y [ › ] interpreting subgroup and quotients in light of these homomorphisms emphasizes the structural concept inherent to these definitions alluded to in the introduction . in general , homomorphisms are neither injective nor surjective . kernel and image of group homomorphisms and the first isomorphism theorem address this phenomenon .
the first extant estonian book is a bilingual german-estonian translation of the lutheran catechism by s. wanradt and j. koell dating to 1535 , during the protestant reformation period . an estonian grammar book to be used by priests was printed in german in 1637 . the new testament was translated into southern estonian in 1686 ( northern estonian , 1715 ) . the two languages were united based on northern estonian by anton thor helle .
the front page caused outrage in liverpool , where the paper lost more than three-quarters of its estimated 55,000 daily sales and still sells poorly in the city more than 25 years later ( around 12,000 ) . it is unavailable in many parts of the city , as many newsagents refuse to stock it . it was revealed in a documentary called alexei sayle 's liverpool , aired in september 2008 , that many liverpudlians will not even take the newspaper for free , and those who do may simply burn or tear it up . liverpudlians refer to the paper as ' the scum ' with campaigners believing it handicapped their fight for justice .
from childhood , gaddafi was aware of the involvement of european colonialists in libya ; his nation was occupied by italy , and during the north african campaign of world war ii it witnessed conflict between italian and british troops . according to later claims , gaddafi 's paternal grandfather , abdessalam bouminyar , was killed by the italian army during the italian invasion of 1911 . at world war ii 's end in 1945 , libya was occupied by british and french forces . although britain and france intended on dividing the nation between their empires , the general assembly of the united nations ( un ) declared that the country be granted political independence . in 1951 , the un created the united kingdom of libya , a federal state under the leadership of a pro-western monarch , idris , who banned political parties and established an absolute monarchy .
since the 1980s it has become common for social and cultural anthropologists to set ethnographic research in the north atlantic region , frequently examining the connections between locations rather than limiting research to a single locale . there has also been a related shift toward broadening the focus beyond the daily life of ordinary people ; increasingly , research is set in settings such as scientific laboratories , social movements , governmental and nongovernmental organizations and businesses .
the somali language is a member of the cushitic branch of the afro-asiatic family . its nearest relatives are the afar and saho languages . somali is the best documented of the cushitic languages , with academic studies of it dating from before 1900 .
in the middle of the 17th century , the peasant rebel leader zhang xianzhong ( 1606-1646 ) from yan 'an , shanxi province , nicknamed yellow tiger , led his peasant troop from north china to the south , and conquered sichuan . upon capturing it , he declared himself emperor of the daxi dynasty ( 大西王朝 ) . in response to the resistance from local elites , he massacred a large native population . as a result of the massacre as well as years of turmoil during the ming-qing transition , the population of sichuan fell sharply , requiring a massive resettlement of people from the neighboring huguang province ( modern hubei and hunan ) and other provinces during the qing dynasty .
during this period boston flourished culturally as well , admired for its rarefied literary life and generous artistic patronage , with members of old boston families - eventually dubbed boston brahmins - coming to be regarded as the nation 's social and cultural elites .
between ad 300 and 1300 in the northern part of the state along the wide , fertile valley on the san miguel river the casas grandes ( big houses ) culture developed into an advanced civilization . the casas grandes civilization is part of a major prehistoric archaeological culture known as mogollon which is related to the ancestral pueblo culture . paquime was the center of the casas grandes civilization . extensive archaeological evidence shows commerce , agriculture , and hunting at paquime and cuarenta casas ( forty houses ) .
soon after the war began , general macarthur had begun planning a landing at incheon , but the pentagon opposed him . when authorized , he activated a combined u.s. army and marine corps , and rok army force . the x corps , led by general edward almond , commander , consisted of 40,000 men of the 1st marine division , the 7th infantry division and around 8,600 rok army soldiers . by 15 september , the amphibious assault force faced few kpa defenders at incheon : military intelligence , psychological warfare , guerrilla reconnaissance , and protracted bombardment facilitated a relatively light battle . however , the bombardment destroyed most of the city of incheon .
following a custom she maintained throughout her widowhood , victoria spent the christmas of 1900 at osborne house on the isle of wight . rheumatism in her legs had rendered her lame , and her eyesight was clouded by cataracts . through early january , she felt " weak and unwell , " and by mid-january she was " drowsy ... dazed , [ and ] confused . " she died on tuesday , 22 january 1901 , at half past six in the evening , at the age of 81 . her son and successor king edward vii , and her eldest grandson , emperor wilhelm ii of germany , were at her deathbed . her favourite pet pomeranian , turri , was laid upon her deathbed as a last request .
during this period , the weapons station was the atlantic fleet 's loadout base for all nuclear ballistic missile submarines . two ssbn " boomer " squadrons and a submarine tender were homeported at the weapons station , while one ssn attack squadron , submarine squadron 4 , and a submarine tender were homeported at the naval base . at the 1996 closure of the station 's polaris missile facility atlantic ( pomflant ) , over 2,500 nuclear warheads and their ugm-27 polaris , ugm-73 poseidon , and ugm-96 trident i delivery missiles ( slbm ) were stored and maintained , guarded by a u.s. marine corps security force company .
following the 2013 emergencies , the minister of foreign affairs tony de brum was encouraged by the obama administration in the united states to turn the crises into an opportunity to promote action against climate change . de brum demanded new commitment and international leadership to stave off further climate disasters from battering his country and other similarly vulnerable countries . in september 2013 , the marshall islands hosted the 44th pacific islands forum summit . de brum proposed a majuro declaration for climate leadership to galvanize concrete action on climate change .
the west balkan coast was inhabited by various illyrian tribes and kingdoms such as the kingdom of the dalmatae and of the ardiaei , who often engaged in piracy under queen teuta ( reigned 231 bc to 227 bce ) . further inland was the illyrian paeonian kingdom and the tribe of the agrianes which covers most of the modern republic of macedonia . illyrians on the coast of the adriatic were under the effects and influence of hellenisation and some tribes adopted greek , becoming bilingual due to their proximity to the greek colonies in illyria . illyrians imported weapons and armor from the ancient greeks ( such as the illyrian type helmet , originally a greek type ) and also adopted the ornamentation of ancient macedon on their shields and their war belts ( a single one has been found , dated 3rd century bc at modern selce e poshtme part of macedon at the time under philip v of macedon ) .
mali lies in the torrid zone and is among the hottest countries in the world . the thermal equator , which matches the hottest spots year-round on the planet based on the mean daily annual temperature , crosses the country . most of mali receives negligible rainfall and droughts are very frequent . late june to early december is the rainy season in the southernmost area . during this time , flooding of the niger river is common , creating the inner niger delta . the vast northern desert part of mali has a hot desert climate ( koppen climate classification ( bwh ) with long , extremely hot summers and scarce rainfall which decreases northwards . the central area has a hot semi-arid climate ( koppen climate classification ( bsh ) with very high temperatures year-round , a long , intense dry season and a brief , irregular rainy season . the little southern band possesses a tropical wet and dry climate ( koppen climate classification ( aw ) very high temperatures year-round with a dry season and a rainy season .
in july 1953 , an armistice took effect with korea divided along approximately the same boundary as in 1950 . the armistice and boundary remain in effect today , with american soldiers stationed there to guarantee it . the armistice , concluded despite opposition from secretary dulles , south korean president syngman rhee , and also within eisenhower 's party , has been described by biographer ambrose as the greatest achievement of the administration . eisenhower had the insight to realize that unlimited war in the nuclear age was unthinkable , and limited war unwinnable .
originally , legislative power was exercised by the sovereign acting on the advice of the curia regis , or royal council , in which important magnates and clerics participated and which evolved into parliament . the so-called model parliament included bishops , abbots , earls , barons , and two knights from each shire and two burgesses from each borough among its members . in 1265 , the earl of leicester irregularly called a full parliament without royal authorisation . the body eventually came to be divided into two branches : bishops , abbots , earls , and barons formed the house of lords , while the shire and borough representatives formed the house of commons . the king would seek the advice and consent of both houses before making any law . during henry vi 's reign , it became regular practice for the two houses to originate legislation in the form of bills , which would not become law unless the sovereign 's assent was obtained , as the sovereign was , and still remains , the enactor of laws . hence , all acts include the clause " be it enacted by the queen 's ( king 's ) most excellent majesty , by and with the advice and consent of the lords spiritual and temporal , and commons , in this present parliament assembled , and by the authority of the same , as follows .... " the parliament acts 1911 and 1949 provide a second potential preamble if the house of lords were to be excluded from the process .
the mc controls the conferencing while it is active on the signaling plane , which is simply where the system manages conferencing creation , endpoint signaling and in-conferencing controls . this component negotiates parameters with every endpoint in the network and controls conferencing resources . while the mc controls resources and signaling negotiations , the mp operates on the media plane and receives media from each endpoint . the mp generates output streams from each endpoint and redirects the information to other endpoints in the conference .
even though , both kashmir shaivism and advaita vedanta are non-dual philosophies which give primacy to universal consciousness ( chit or brahman ) , in kashmir shavisim , as opposed to advaita , all things are a manifestation of this consciousness . this implies that from the point of view of kashmir shavisim , the phenomenal world ( sakti ) is real , and it exists and has its being in consciousness ( chit ) . whereas , advaita holds that brahman is inactive ( niskriya ) and the phenomenal world is an illusion ( maya ) . the objective of human life , according to kashmir shaivism , is to merge in shiva or universal consciousness , or to realize one 's already existing identity with shiva , by means of wisdom , yoga and grace .
the united states is the chief remaining nation to assign official responsibilities to a region called the near east . within the government the state department has been most influential in promulgating the near eastern regional system . the countries of the former empires of the 19th century have in general abandoned the term and the subdivision in favor of middle east , north africa and various forms of asia . in many cases , such as france , no distinct regional substructures have been employed . each country has its own french diplomatic apparatus , although regional terms , including proche-orient and moyen-orient , may be used in a descriptive sense . the most influential agencies in the united states still using near east as a working concept are as follows .
though the state is deficient in food grains , it has gained a lot in other spheres of agricultural production such as seed potato , ginger , vegetables , vegetable seeds , mushrooms , chicory seeds , hops , olives and fig . seed potato is mostly grown in the shimla , kullu and lahaul areas . special efforts are being made to promote cultivation of crops like olives , figs , hops , mushrooms , flowers , pistachio nuts , sarda melon and saffron . solan is the largest vegetable producing district in the state . the district of sirmaur is also famous for growing flowers , and is the largest producer of flowers in the state .
another point of interest is the old town . in the centre are the large marktkirche ( church st. georgii et jacobi , preaching venue of the bishop of the lutheran landeskirche hannovers ) and the old town hall . nearby are the leibniz house , the nolte house , and the beguine tower . a very nice quarter of the old town is the kreuz-church-quarter around the kreuz church with many nice little lanes . nearby is the old royal sports hall , now called the ballhof theatre . on the edge of the old town are the market hall , the leine palace , and the ruin of the aegidien church which is now a monument to the victims of war and violence . through the marstall gate you arrive at the bank of the river leine , where the world-famous nanas of niki de saint-phalle are located . they are part of the mile of sculptures , which starts from trammplatz , leads along the river bank , crosses konigsworther square , and ends at the entrance of the georgengarten . near the old town is the district of calenberger neustadt where the catholic basilica minor of st. clemens , the reformed church and the lutheran neustadter hof- und stadtkirche st. johannis are located .
the emergence of resistance of bacteria to antibiotics is a common phenomenon . emergence of resistance often reflects evolutionary processes that take place during antibiotic therapy . the antibiotic treatment may select for bacterial strains with physiologically or genetically enhanced capacity to survive high doses of antibiotics . under certain conditions , it may result in preferential growth of resistant bacteria , while growth of susceptible bacteria is inhibited by the drug . for example , antibacterial selection for strains having previously acquired antibacterial-resistance genes was demonstrated in 1943 by the luria-delbruck experiment . antibiotics such as penicillin and erythromycin , which used to have a high efficacy against many bacterial species and strains , have become less effective , due to the increased resistance of many bacterial strains .
while the new technique of polyphony was developing in the west , the eastern orthodox church resisted any type of change . therefore , byzantine music remained monophonic and without any form of instrumental accompaniment . as a result , and despite certain attempts by certain greek chanters ( such as manouel gazis , ioannis plousiadinos or the cypriot ieronimos o tragoudistis ) , byzantine music was deprived of elements of which in the west encouraged an unimpeded development of art . however , this method which kept music away from polyphony , along with centuries of continuous culture , enabled monophonic music to develop to the greatest heights of perfection . byzantium presented the monophonic byzantine chant ; a melodic treasury of inestimable value for its rhythmical variety and expressive power .
ibm also holds the smartcamp program globally . the program searches for fresh start-up companies that ibm can partner with to solve world problems . ibm holds 17 smartcamp events around the world . since july 2011 , ibm has partnered with pennies , the electronic charity box , and produced a software solution for ibm retail customers that provides an easy way to donate money when paying in-store by credit or debit card . customers donate just a few pence ( 1p-99p ) a time and every donation goes to uk charities .
christianity ( 59 % ) , particularly catholicism ( 33 % ) , was the most prevalently practiced religion in new york as of 2014 , followed by judaism , with approximately 1.1 million jews in new york city , over half living in brooklyn . islam ranks third in new york city , with official estimates ranging between 600,000 and 1,000,000 observers and including 10 % of the city 's public schoolchildren , followed by hinduism , buddhism , and a variety of other religions , as well as atheism . in 2014 , 24 % self-identified with no organized religious affiliation .
by the early 20th century , mass civil disorder had begun in china , and it was growing continuously . to overcome such problems , empress dowager cixi issued an imperial edict in 1901 calling for reform proposals from the governors-general and governors and initiated the era of the dynasty 's " new policies , " also known as the " late qing reform . " the edict paved the way for the most far-reaching reforms in terms of their social consequences , including the creation of a national education system and the abolition of the imperial examinations in 1905 .
in the late 1990s and early 2000s , the ifab experimented with ways of creating a winner without requiring a penalty shootout , which was often seen as an undesirable way to end a match . these involved rules ending a game in extra time early , either when the first goal in extra time was scored ( golden goal ) , or if one team held a lead at the end of the first period of extra time ( silver goal ) . golden goal was used at the world cup in 1998 and 2002 . the first world cup game decided by a golden goal was france 's victory over paraguay in 1998 . germany was the first nation to score a golden goal in a major competition , beating czech republic in the final of euro 1996 . silver goal was used in euro 2004 . both these experiments have been discontinued by ifab .
in the mid 1970s , various american groups ( some with ties to downtown manhattan 's punk scene , including television and suicide ) had begun expanding on the vocabulary of punk music . midwestern groups such as pere ubu and devo drew inspiration from the region 's derelict industrial environments , employing conceptual art techniques , musique concrete and unconventional verbal styles that would presage the post-punk movement by several years . a variety of subsequent groups , including new york-based talking heads and boston-based mission of burma , combined elements of punk with art school sensibilities . in 1978 , the former band began a series of collaborations with british ambient pioneer and ex-roxy music member brian eno , experimenting with dada-influenced lyrical techniques , dance music , and african polyrhythms . san francisco 's vibrant post-punk scene was centered around such groups as chrome , the residents and tuxedomoon , who incorporated multimedia experimentation , film and ideas from antonin artaud 's theater of cruelty .
the development of writing enabled knowledge to be stored and communicated across generations with much greater fidelity . combined with the development of agriculture , which allowed for a surplus of food , it became possible for early civilizations to develop , because more time and effort could be devoted to tasks ( other than food production ) than hunter-gatherers or early subsistence farmers had available . this surplus allowed a community to support individuals who did things other than work towards bare survival . these other tasks included systematic studies of nature , study of written information gathered and recorded by others , and often of adding to that body of information .
the band have released a total of eighteen number one albums , eighteen number one singles , and ten number one dvds worldwide , making them one of the world 's best-selling music artists . queen have sold over 150 million records , with some estimates in excess of 300 million records worldwide , including 34.5 million albums in the us as of 2004 . inducted into the rock and roll hall of fame in 2001 , the band is the only group in which every member has composed more than one chart-topping single , and all four members were inducted into the songwriters hall of fame in 2003 . in 2009 , " we will rock you " and " we are the champions " were inducted into the grammy hall of fame , and the latter was voted the world 's favourite song in a global music poll .
hops contain several characteristics that brewers desire in beer . hops contribute a bitterness that balances the sweetness of the malt ; the bitterness of beers is measured on the international bitterness units scale . hops contribute floral , citrus , and herbal aromas and flavours to beer . hops have an antibiotic effect that favours the activity of brewer 's yeast over less desirable microorganisms and aids in " head retention , " the length of time that a foamy head created by carbonation will last . the acidity of hops is a preservative .
hospitals in liberia include the john f. kennedy medical center in monrovia and several others . life expectancy in liberia is estimated to be 57.4 years in 2012 . with a fertility rate of 5.9 births per woman , the maternal mortality rate stood at 990 per 100,000 births in 2010 . a number of highly communicable diseases are widespread , including tuberculosis , diarrheal diseases and malaria . in 2007 , the hiv infection rates stood at 2 % of the population aged 15-49 whereas the incidence of tuberculosis was 420 per 100,000 people in 2008 . approximately 58.2 % - 66 % of women are estimated to have undergone female genital mutilation .
but sebastiao de melo 's greatest reforms were economic and financial , with the creation of several companies and guilds to regulate every commercial activity . he demarcated the region for production of port to ensure the wine 's quality , and this was the first attempt to control wine quality and production in europe . he ruled with a strong hand by imposing strict law upon all classes of portuguese society from the high nobility to the poorest working class , along with a widespread review of the country 's tax system . these reforms gained him enemies in the upper classes , especially among the high nobility , who despised him as a social upstart .
cockroaches are among the fastest insect runners and , at full speed , adopt a bipedal run to reach a high velocity in proportion to their body size . as cockroaches move very quickly , they need to be video recorded at several hundred frames per second to reveal their gait . more sedate locomotion is seen in the stick insects or walking sticks ( phasmatodea ) . a few insects have evolved to walk on the surface of the water , especially members of the gerridae family , commonly known as water striders . a few species of ocean-skaters in the genus halobates even live on the surface of open oceans , a habitat that has few insect species .
it is also known as the wenchuan earthquake ( chinese : 汶川大地震 ; pinyin : wenchuan da dizhen ; literally : " great wenchuan earthquake " ) , after the location of the earthquake 's epicenter , wenchuan county , sichuan . the epicenter was 80 kilometres ( 50 mi ) west-northwest of chengdu , the provincial capital , with a focal depth of 19 km ( 12 mi ) . the earthquake was also felt in nearby countries and as far away as both beijing and shanghai - 1,500 km ( 930 mi ) and 1,700 km ( 1,060 mi ) away - where office buildings swayed with the tremor . strong aftershocks , some exceeding magnitude 6 , continued to hit the area even months after the main quake , causing new casualties and damage .
in the last years of the 19th century the term " near east " acquired considerable disrepute in eyes of the english-speaking public as did the ottoman empire itself . the cause of the onus was the hamidian massacres of armenians because they were christians , but it seemed to spill over into the protracted conflicts of the balkans . for a time , " near east " meant primarily the balkans . robert hichens ' book the near east ( 1913 ) is subtitled dalmatia , greece and constantinople .
the city 's greektown and three downtown casino resort hotels serve as part of an entertainment hub . the eastern market farmer 's distribution center is the largest open-air flowerbed market in the united states and has more than 150 foods and specialty businesses . on saturdays , about 45,000 people shop the city 's historic eastern market . the midtown and the new center area are centered on wayne state university and henry ford hospital . midtown has about 50,000 residents and attracts millions of visitors each year to its museums and cultural centers ; for example , the detroit festival of the arts in midtown draws about 350,000 people .
afl global and ganlan media were created in 2012 by businessman martin e. judge , founder and owner of the judge group . the company , called afl global , llc , looks to introduce and launch professional arena football teams and franchises in various locations throughout the world ( like nfl europe ) . after their successful trip to china to help promote the game , they formally announced plans to further develop afl china by the fall of 2014 by starting a comprehensive training program in may 2013 with exhibition games planned for the cities of beijing and guangzhou in october . this is the first time professional football of any kind will be played in china with the support of the chinese government and the crfa ( chinese rugby football association ) . key persons involved include founder and ceo . martin e. judge , partner ron jaworski , cafl ceo gary morris and president david niu . ganlan media has since dropped this name and will carry the league 's name as its corporate identity .
the hellenistic period covers the period of ancient greek ( hellenic ) history and mediterranean history between the death of alexander the great in 323 bc and the emergence of the roman empire as signified by the battle of actium in 31 bc and the subsequent conquest of ptolemaic egypt the following year . at this time , greek cultural influence and power was at its peak in europe , africa and asia , experiencing prosperity and progress in the arts , exploration , literature , theatre , architecture , music , mathematics , philosophy , and science . for example , competitive public games took place , ideas in biology , and popular entertainment in theaters . it is often considered a period of transition , sometimes even of decadence or degeneration , compared to the enlightenment of the greek classical era . the hellenistic period saw the rise of new comedy , alexandrian poetry , the septuagint and the philosophies of stoicism and epicureanism . greek science was advanced by the works of the mathematician euclid and the polymath archimedes . the religious sphere expanded to include new gods such as the greco-egyptian serapis , eastern deities such as attis and cybele and the greek adoption of buddhism .
the deeper ancestral demography of bermuda 's population has been obscured by the ethnic homogenisation of the last four centuries . there is effectively no ethnic distinction between black and white bermudians , other than those characterising recent immigrant communities . in the 17th century , this was not so . for the first hundred years of settlement , white protestants of english heritage were the distinct majority , with white minorities of irish ( the native language of many of whom can be assumed to have been gaelic ) and scots sent to bermuda after the english invasions of their homelands that followed the english civil war . non-white minorities included spanish-speaking , free ( indentured ) blacks from the west indies , black chattel slaves primarily captured from spanish and portuguese ships by bermudian privateers , and native americans , primarily from the algonquian and other tribes of the atlantic seaboard , but possibly from as far away as mexico . by the 19th century , the white ethnically-english bermudians had lost their numerical advantage . despite the banning of the importation of irish , and the repeated attempts to force free blacks to emigrate and the owners of black slaves to export them , the merging of the various minority groups , along with some of the white english , had resulted in a new demographic group , " coloured " ( which term , in bermuda , referred to anyone not wholly of european ancestry ) bermudians , gaining a slight majority . any child born before or since then to one coloured and one white parent has been added to the coloured statistic . most of those historically described as " coloured " are today described as " black , " or " of african heritage , " which obscures their non-african heritage ( those previously described as " coloured " who were not of african ancestry had been very few , though the numbers of south asians , particularly , is now growing . the number of persons born in asian countries doubled between the 2000 and the 2010 censuses ) , blacks have remained in the majority , with new white immigration from portugal , britain and elsewhere countered by black immigration from the west indies .
some new immigrants arrived as refugees with no possessions and were housed in temporary camps known as ma 'abarot ; by 1952 , over 200,000 immigrants were living in these tent cities . during this period , food , clothes and furniture had to be rationed in what became known as the austerity period . the need to solve the crisis led ben-gurion to sign a reparations agreement with west germany that triggered mass protests by jews angered at the idea that israel could accept monetary compensation for the holocaust .
in 1960 , columbia / cbs began negotiations with its main international distributor philips records with the goal of cbs starting its own global record company . philips ' acquisition of mercury records in the us in 1961 paved the way for this . cbs only had the rights to the columbia name in north america ; therefore the international arm founded in 1961 and launched in 1962 utilized the " cbs records " name only , with philips records distributing the label in europe . cbs 's mexican record company , discos columbia , was renamed discos cbs by 1963 .
the criminal justice information services ( cjis ) division , is located in clarksburg , west virginia . organized beginning in 1991 , the office opened in 1995 as the youngest agency division . the complex is the length of three football fields . it provides a main repository for information in various data systems . under the roof of the cjis are the programs for the national crime information center ( ncic ) , uniform crime reporting ( ucr ) , fingerprint identification , integrated automated fingerprint identification system ( iafis ) , ncic 2000 , and the national incident-based reporting system ( nibrs ) . many state and local agencies use these data systems as a source for their own investigations and contribute to the database using secure communications . fbi provides these tools of sophisticated identification and information services to local , state , federal , and international law enforcement agencies .
germany is a federal republic consisting of sixteen federal states ( german : bundesland , or land ) .

in cities other than rome , the name cardinal began to be applied to certain church men as a mark of honour . the earliest example of this occurs in a letter sent by pope zacharias in 747 to pippin iii ( the short ) , ruler of the franks , in which zacharias applied the title to the priests of paris to distinguish them from country clergy . this meaning of the word spread rapidly , and from the 9th century various episcopal cities had a special class among the clergy known as cardinals . the use of the title was reserved for the cardinals of rome in 1567 by pius v .
napoleon maintained strict , efficient work habits , prioritizing what needed to be done . he cheated at cards , but repaid the losses ; he had to win at everything he attempted . he kept relays of staff and secretaries at work . unlike many generals , napoleon did not examine history to ask what hannibal or alexander or anyone else did in a similar situation . critics said he won many battles simply because of luck ; napoleon responded , " give me lucky generals , " aware that " luck " comes to leaders who recognize opportunity , and seize it . dwyer argues that napoleon 's victories at austerlitz and jena in 1805-06 heightened his sense of self-grandiosity , leaving him even more certain of his destiny and invincibility . by the russian campaign in 1812 , however , napoleon seems to have lost his verve . with crisis after crisis at hand , he rarely rose to the occasion . some historians have suggested a physical deterioration , but others note that an impaired napoleon was still a brilliant general .

the game pad controllers were more-or-less copied directly from the game & watch machines , although the famicom design team originally wanted to use arcade-style joysticks , even taking apart ones from american game consoles to see how they worked . however , it was eventually decided that children might step on joysticks left on the floor and their durability was also questioned . katsuyah nakawaka attached a game & watch d-pad to the famicom prototype and found that it was easy to use and had no discomfort . ultimately though , they did install a 15-pin expansion port on the front of the console so that an arcade-style joystick could be used optionally . the controllers were hard-wired to the console with no connectors for cost reasons .
john calvin supported the " agent of god " christology and argued that in his trial in pilate 's court jesus could have successfully argued for his innocence , but instead submitted to crucifixion in obedience to the father . this christological theme continued into the 20th century , both in the eastern and western churches . in the eastern church sergei bulgakov argued that the crucifixion of jesus was " pre-eternally " determined by the father before the creation of the world , to redeem humanity from the disgrace caused by the fall of adam . in the western church , karl rahner elaborated on the analogy that the blood of the lamb of god ( and the water from the side of jesus ) shed at the crucifixion had a cleansing nature , similar to baptismal water .

two major hardware revisions of the xbox 360 have succeeded the original models ; the xbox 360 s ( also referred to as the " slim " ) replaced the original " elite " and " arcade " models in 2010 . the s model carries a smaller , streamlined appearance with an angular case , and utilizes a redesigned motherboard designed to alleviate the hardware and overheating issues experienced by prior models . it also includes a proprietary port for use with the kinect sensor . the xbox 360 e , a further streamlined variation of the 360 s with a two-tone rectangular case inspired by xbox one , was released in 2013 . in addition to its revised aesthetics , xbox 360 e also has one fewer usb port and no longer supports s / pdif .
german air attacks on the british isles increased in 1915 and the aa efforts were deemed somewhat ineffective , so a royal navy gunnery expert , admiral sir percy scott , was appointed to make improvements , particularly an integrated aa defence for london . the air defences were expanded with more rnvr aa guns , 75 mm and 3-inch , the pom-poms being ineffective . the naval 3-inch was also adopted by the army , the qf 3 inch 20 cwt ( 76 mm ) , a new field mounting was introduced in 1916 . since most attacks were at night , searchlights were soon used , and acoustic methods of detection and locating were developed . by december 1916 there were 183 aa sections defending britain ( most with the 3-inch ) , 74 with the bef in france and 10 in the middle east .

the papacy further refined the practice in the mass in the late middle ages , holding that the clergy alone was allowed to partake of the wine in the eucharist . this further distanced the secular laity from the clergy . the laity continued the practices of pilgrimages , veneration of relics , and belief in the power of the devil . mystics such as meister eckhart ( d . 1327 ) and thomas a kempis ( d . 1471 ) wrote works that taught the laity to focus on their inner spiritual life , which laid the groundwork for the protestant reformation . besides mysticism , belief in witches and witchcraft became widespread , and by the late 15th century the church had begun to lend credence to populist fears of witchcraft with its condemnation of witches in 1484 and the publication in 1486 of the malleus maleficarum , the most popular handbook for witch-hunters .
there are 20 clubs in the premier league . during the course of a season ( from august to may ) each club plays the others twice ( a double round-robin system ) , once at their home stadium and once at that of their opponents , for a total of 38 games . teams receive three points for a win and one point for a draw . no points are awarded for a loss . teams are ranked by total points , then goal difference , and then goals scored . if still equal , teams are deemed to occupy the same position . if there is a tie for the championship , for relegation , or for qualification to other competitions , a play-off match at a neutral venue decides rank . the three lowest placed teams are relegated into the football league championship , and the top two teams from the championship , together with the winner of play-offs involving the third to sixth placed championship clubs , are promoted in their place .

the m. tuberculosis complex ( mtbc ) includes four other tb-causing mycobacteria : m. bovis , m. africanum , m. canetti , and m. microti . m. africanum is not widespread , but it is a significant cause of tuberculosis in parts of africa . m. bovis was once a common cause of tuberculosis , but the introduction of pasteurized milk has almost completely eliminated this as a public health problem in developed countries . m. canetti is rare and seems to be limited to the horn of africa , although a few cases have been seen in african emigrants . m. microti is also rare and is seen almost only in immunodeficient people , although its prevalence may be significantly underestimated .
critics such as economist paul krugman and u.s. treasury secretary timothy geithner have argued that the regulatory framework did not keep pace with financial innovation , such as the increasing importance of the shadow banking system , derivatives and off-balance sheet financing . a recent oecd study suggest that bank regulation based on the basel accords encourage unconventional business practices and contributed to or even reinforced the financial crisis . in other cases , laws were changed or enforcement weakened in parts of the financial system . key examples include :
john had spent the conflict travelling alongside his father , and was given widespread possessions across the angevin empire as part of the montlouis settlement ; from then onwards , most observers regarded john as henry ii 's favourite child , although he was the furthest removed in terms of the royal succession . henry ii began to find more lands for john , mostly at various nobles ' expense . in 1175 he appropriated the estates of the late earl of cornwall and gave them to john . the following year , henry disinherited the sisters of isabelle of gloucester , contrary to legal custom , and betrothed john to the now extremely wealthy isabelle . in 1177 , at the council of oxford , henry dismissed william fitzaldelm as the lord of ireland and replaced him with the ten-year-old john .
in 1393 king richard ii compelled landlords to erect signs outside their premises . the legislation stated " whosoever shall brew ale in the town with intention of selling it must hang out a sign , otherwise he shall forfeit his ale . " this was to make alehouses easily visible to passing inspectors , borough ale tasters , who would decide the quality of the ale they provided . william shakespeare 's father , john shakespeare , was one such inspector .
kerry established a separate political action committee , keeping america 's promise , which declared as its mandate " a democratic congress will restore accountability to washington and help change a disastrous course in iraq , " and raised money and channeled contributions to democratic candidates in state and federal races . through keeping america 's promise in 2005 , kerry raised over $ 5.5 million for other democrats up and down the ballot . through his campaign account and his political action committee , the kerry campaign operation generated more than $ 10 million for various party committees and 179 candidates for the u.s. house , senate , state and local offices in 42 states focusing on the midterm elections during the 2006 election cycle .

the creation of the federal republic of germany in 1949 was through the unification of the western states ( which were previously under american , british , and french administration ) created in the aftermath of world war ii . initially , in 1949 , the states of the federal republic were baden , bavaria ( in german : bayern ) , bremen , hamburg , hesse ( hessen ) , lower saxony ( niedersachsen ) , north rhine westphalia ( nordrhein-westfalen ) , rhineland-palatinate ( rheinland-pfalz ) , schleswig-holstein , wurttemberg-baden , and wurttemberg-hohenzollern . west berlin , while officially not part of the federal republic , was largely integrated and considered as a de facto state .
from the 1880s to 1914 , the european powers expanded their control across the african continent , competing with each other for africa 's land and resources . great britain controlled various colonial holdings in east africa that spanned the length of the african continent from egypt in the north to south africa . the french gained major ground in west africa , and the portuguese held colonies in southern africa . germany , italy , and spain established a small number of colonies at various points throughout the continent , which included german east africa ( tanganyika ) and german southwest africa for germany , eritrea and libya for italy , and the canary islands and rio de oro in northwestern africa for spain . finally , for king leopold ( ruled from 1865-1909 ) , there was the large " piece of that great african cake " known as the congo , which , unfortunately for the native congolese , became his personal fiefdom to do with as he pleased in central africa . by 1914 , almost the entire continent was under european control . liberia , which was settled by freed american slaves in the 1820s , and abyssinia ( ethiopia ) in eastern africa were the last remaining independent african states .

sexual identity and sexual behavior are closely related to sexual orientation , but they are distinguished , with sexual identity referring to an individual 's conception of themselves , behavior referring to actual sexual acts performed by the individual , and orientation referring to " fantasies , attachments and longings . " individuals may or may not express their sexual orientation in their behaviors . people who have a homosexual sexual orientation that does not align with their sexual identity are sometimes referred to as ' closeted ' . the term may , however , reflect a certain cultural context and particular stage of transition in societies which are gradually dealing with integrating sexual minorities . in studies related to sexual orientation , when dealing with the degree to which a person 's sexual attractions , behaviors and identity match , scientists usually use the terms concordance or discordance . thus , a woman who is attracted to other women , but calls herself heterosexual and only has sexual relations with men , can be said to experience discordance between her sexual orientation ( homosexual or lesbian ) and her sexual identity and behaviors ( heterosexual ) .

the establishment of ottoman military aviation dates back to between june 1909 and july 1911 . the ottoman empire started preparing its first pilots and planes , and with the founding of the aviation school ( tayyare mektebi ) in yesilkoy on 3 july 1912 , the empire began to tutor its own flight officers . the founding of the aviation school quickened advancement in the military aviation program , increased the number of enlisted persons within it , and gave the new pilots an active role in the ottoman army and navy . in may 1913 the world 's first specialized reconnaissance training program was started by the aviation school and the first separate reconnaissance division was established . [ citation needed ] in june 1914 a new military academy , the naval aviation school ( bahriye tayyare mektebi ) was founded . with the outbreak of world war i , the modernization process stopped abruptly . the ottoman aviation squadrons fought on many fronts during world war i , from galicia in the west to the caucasus in the east and yemen in the south .
the simplest method , used for small-scale production and often by hobbyists , is immersion etching , in which the board is submerged in etching solution such as ferric chloride . compared with methods used for mass production , the etching time is long . heat and agitation can be applied to the bath to speed the etching rate . in bubble etching , air is passed through the etchant bath to agitate the solution and speed up etching . splash etching uses a motor-driven paddle to splash boards with etchant ; the process has become commercially obsolete since it is not as fast as spray etching . in spray etching , the etchant solution is distributed over the boards by nozzles , and recirculated by pumps . adjustment of the nozzle pattern , flow rate , temperature , and etchant composition gives predictable control of etching rates and high production rates .
there are two main termini for bus services . as the biggest operator , first uses stops around pound tree road . this leaves the other terminal of west quay available for other operators . uni-link passes west quay in both directions , and wilts & dorset drop passengers off and pick them up there , terminating at a series of bus stands along the road . certain bluestar services also do this , while others stop at bargate and some loop round west quay , stopping at hanover buildings . there was a tram system from 1879 to 1949 .

the bell telephone company was created in 1877 , and by 1886 , more than 150,000 people in the u.s. owned telephones . bell company engineers made numerous other improvements to the telephone , which emerged as one of the most successful products ever . in 1879 , the bell company acquired edison 's patents for the carbon microphone from western union . this made the telephone practical for longer distances , and it was no longer necessary to shout to be heard at the receiving telephone .
the small woolen dolls called maniae , hung on the compitalia shrines , were thought a symbolic replacement for child-sacrifice to mania , as mother of the lares . the junii took credit for its abolition by their ancestor l. junius brutus , traditionally rome 's republican founder and first consul . political or military executions were sometimes conducted in such a way that they evoked human sacrifice , whether deliberately or in the perception of witnesses ; marcus marius gratidianus was a gruesome example .
when world war i broke out leading to confrontation between the ottoman empire and the russian empire in the caucasus and persian campaigns , the new government in istanbul began to look on the armenians with distrust and suspicion . this was because the imperial russian army contained a contingent of armenian volunteers . on 24 april 1915 , armenian intellectuals were arrested by ottoman authorities and , with the tehcir law ( 29 may 1915 ) , eventually a large proportion of armenians living in anatolia perished in what has become known as the armenian genocide .
under new york state 's gradual abolition act of 1799 , children of slave mothers were born to be eventually liberated but were held in indentured servitude until their mid-to-late twenties . together with slaves freed by their masters after the revolutionary war and escaped slaves , a significant free-black population gradually developed in manhattan . under such influential united states founders as alexander hamilton and john jay , the new york manumission society worked for abolition and established the african free school to educate black children . it was not until 1827 that slavery was completely abolished in the state , and free blacks struggled afterward with discrimination . new york interracial abolitionist activism continued ; among its leaders were graduates of the african free school . the city 's black population reached more than 16,000 in 1840 .

although alexander graham bell is most often associated with the invention of the telephone , his interests were extremely varied . according to one of his biographers , charlotte gray , bell 's work ranged " unfettered across the scientific landscape " and he often went to bed voraciously reading the encyclopædia britannica , scouring it for new areas of interest . the range of bell 's inventive genius is represented only in part by the 18 patents granted in his name alone and the 12 he shared with his collaborators . these included 14 for the telephone and telegraph , four for the photophone , one for the phonograph , five for aerial vehicles , four for " hydroairplanes " and two for selenium cells . bell 's inventions spanned a wide range of interests and included a metal jacket to assist in breathing , the audiometer to detect minor hearing problems , a device to locate icebergs , investigations on how to separate salt from seawater , and work on finding alternative fuels .
like much of the southeastern united states , raleigh has a humid subtropical climate ( koppen cfa ) , with four distinct seasons . winters are short and generally cool , with a january daily average of 41.0 ° f ( 5.0 ° c ) . on average , there are 69 nights per year that drop to or below freezing , and only 2.7 days that fail to rise above freezing . april is the driest month , with an average of 2.91 inches ( 73.9 mm ) of precipitation . precipitation is well distributed around the year , with a slight maximum between july and september ; on average , july is the wettest month , owing to generally frequent , sometimes heavy , showers and thunderstorms . summers are hot and humid , with a daily average in july of 80.0 ° f ( 26.7 ° c ) . there are 48 days per year with highs at or above 90 ° f ( 32 ° c ) . autumn is similar to spring overall but has fewer days of rainfall . extremes in temperature have ranged from − 9 ° f ( − 23 ° c ) on january 21 , 1985 up to 105 ° f ( 41 ° c ) , most recently on july 8 , 2012 .
text is frequently incorporated into comics via speech balloons , captions , and sound effects . speech balloons indicate dialogue ( or thought , in the case of thought balloons ) , with tails pointing at their respective speakers . captions can give voice to a narrator , convey characters ' dialogue or thoughts , or indicate place or time . speech balloons themselves are strongly associated with comics , such that the addition of one to an image is sufficient to turn the image into comics . sound effects mimic non-vocal sounds textually using onomatopoeia sound-words .
by summer of 2003 , howard dean had become the apparent front runner for the democratic nomination , performing strongly in most polls and leading the pack with the largest campaign war chest . dean 's strength as a fund raiser was attributed mainly to his embrace of the internet for campaigning . the majority of his donations came from individual supporters , who became known as deanites , or , more commonly , deaniacs . generally regarded as a pragmatic centrist during his time as governor , dean emerged during his presidential campaign as a left-wing populist , denouncing the policies of the bush administration ( especially the 2003 invasion of iraq ) as well as fellow democrats , who , in his view , failed to strongly oppose them . senator lieberman , a liberal on domestic issues but a hawk on the war on terror , failed to gain traction with liberal democratic primary voters .
the " notre dame victory march " is the fight song for the university of notre dame . it was written by two brothers who were notre dame graduates . the rev. michael j. shea , a 1904 graduate , wrote the music , and his brother , john f. shea , who earned degrees in 1906 and 1908 , wrote the original lyrics . the lyrics were revised in the 1920s ; it first appeared under the copyright of the university of notre dame in 1928 . the chorus is , " cheer cheer for old notre dame , wake up the echos cheering her name . send a volley cheer on high , shake down the thunder from the sky ! what though the odds be great or small , old notre dame will win over all . while her loyal sons are marching , onward to victory ! "
popper won many awards and honours in his field , including the lippincott award of the american political science association , the sonning prize , the otto hahn peace medal of the united nations association of germany in berlin and fellowships in the royal society , british academy , london school of economics , king 's college london , darwin college , cambridge , and charles university , prague . austria awarded him the grand decoration of honour in gold for services to the republic of austria in 1986 , and the federal republic of germany its grand cross with star and sash of the order of merit , and the peace class of the order pour le merite . he received the humanist laureate award from the international academy of humanism . he was knighted by queen elizabeth ii in 1965 , and was elected a fellow of the royal society in 1976 . he was invested with the insignia of a companion of honour in 1982 .
the greek cypriot population , meanwhile , had become hopeful that the british administration would lead to enosis . the idea of enosis was historically part of the megali idea , a greater political ambition of a greek state encompassing the territories with greek inhabitants in the former ottoman empire , including cyprus and asia minor with a capital in constantinople , and was actively pursued by the cypriot orthodox church , which had its members educated in greece . these religious officials , together with greek military officers and professionals , some of whom still pursued the megali idea , would later found the guerrilla organisation ethniki organosis kyprion agoniston or national organisation of cypriot fighters ( eoka ) . the greek cypriots viewed the island as historically greek and believed that union with greece was a natural right . in the 1950s , the pursuit of enosis became a part of the greek national policy ,
the red rose of lancaster is the county flower found on the county 's heraldic badge and flag . the rose was a symbol of the house of lancaster , immortalised in the verse " in the battle for england 's head / york was white , lancaster red " ( referring to the 15th-century wars of the roses ) . the traditional lancashire flag , a red rose on a white field , was not officially registered . when an attempt was made to register it with the flag institute it was found that it was officially registered by montrose in scotland , several hundred years earlier with the lyon office . lancashire 's official flag is registered as a red rose on a gold field .
providing sufficient base drive current is a key problem in the use of bipolar transistors as switches . the transistor provides current gain , allowing a relatively large current in the collector to be switched by a much smaller current into the base terminal . the ratio of these currents varies depending on the type of transistor , and even for a particular type , varies depending on the collector current . in the example light-switch circuit shown , the resistor is chosen to provide enough base current to ensure the transistor will be saturated .
the wayback machine is a digital archive of the world wide web and other information on the internet created by the internet archive , a nonprofit organization , based in san francisco , california , united states . it was set up by brewster kahle and bruce gilliat , and is maintained with content from alexa internet . the service enables users to see archived versions of web pages across time , which the archive calls a " three dimensional index .

grapes are a type of fruit that grow in clusters of 15 to 300 , and can be crimson , black , dark blue , yellow , green , orange , and pink . " white " grapes are actually green in color , and are evolutionarily derived from the purple grape . mutations in two regulatory genes of white grapes turn off production of anthocyanins , which are responsible for the color of purple grapes . anthocyanins and other pigment chemicals of the larger family of polyphenols in purple grapes are responsible for the varying shades of purple in red wines . grapes are typically an ellipsoid shape resembling a prolate spheroid .
the new supreme court of new zealand was officially established at the beginning of 2004 , although it did not come into operation until july . the high court of new zealand was until 1980 known as the supreme court . the supreme court has a purely appellate jurisdiction and hears appeals from the court of appeal of new zealand . in some cases , an appeal may be removed directly to the supreme court from the high court . for certain cases , particularly cases which commenced in the district court , a lower court ( typically the high court or the court of appeal ) may be the court of final jurisdiction .
in 1897 , frank shuman , a u.s. inventor , engineer and solar energy pioneer built a small demonstration solar engine that worked by reflecting solar energy onto square boxes filled with ether , which has a lower boiling point than water , and were fitted internally with black pipes which in turn powered a steam engine . in 1908 shuman formed the sun power company with the intent of building larger solar power plants . he , along with his technical advisor a.s.e. ackermann and british physicist sir charles vernon boys , developed an improved system using mirrors to reflect solar energy upon collector boxes , increasing heating capacity to the extent that water could now be used instead of ether . shuman then constructed a full-scale steam engine powered by low-pressure water , enabling him to patent the entire solar engine system by 1912 .
prior to the designation of immunity from the etymological root immunis , which is latin for " exempt " ; early physicians characterized organs that would later be proven as essential components of the immune system . the important lymphoid organs of the immune system are the thymus and bone marrow , and chief lymphatic tissues such as spleen , tonsils , lymph vessels , lymph nodes , adenoids , and liver . when health conditions worsen to emergency status , portions of immune system organs including the thymus , spleen , bone marrow , lymph nodes and other lymphatic tissues can be surgically excised for examination while patients are still alive .
for collectable or nostalgia purposes , or for the benefit of higher-quality audio playback provided by the 78 rpm speed with newer vinyl records and their lightweight stylus pickups , a small number of 78 rpm records have been released since the major labels ceased production . one of the first attempts at this was in the 1950s , when inventor ewing dunbar nunn founded the label audiophile records , which released , in addition to standard 33 1 / 3 rpm lps , 78 rpm-mastered albums that were microgroove and pressed on vinyl ( as opposed to traditional 78s , with their shellac composition and wider 3-mil sized grooves ) . this was done by the label mainly to take advantage of the wider audio frequency response that faster speeds like 78 rpm can provide for vinyl microgroove records , hence the label 's name ( obviously catering to the audiophiles of the 1950s " hi-fi " era , when stereo gear could provide a much wider range of audio than before ) . also in the late 1950s , bell records released a few budget-priced 7 " microgrooved records at 78 rpm .
according to forbes magazine , oklahoma city-based devon energy corporation , chesapeake energy corporation , and sandridge energy corporation are the largest private oil-related companies in the nation , and all of oklahoma 's fortune 500 companies are energy-related . tulsa 's oneok and williams companies are the state 's largest and second-largest companies respectively , also ranking as the nation 's second and third-largest companies in the field of energy , according to fortune magazine . the magazine also placed devon energy as the second-largest company in the mining and crude oil-producing industry in the nation , while chesapeake energy ranks seventh respectively in that sector and oklahoma gas & electric ranks as the 25th-largest gas and electric utility company .
the riba has three parts to the education process : part i which is generally a three-year first degree , a year-out of at least one year work experience in an architectural practice precedes the part ii which is generally a two-year post graduate diploma or masters . a further year out must be taken before the riba part iii professional exams can be taken . overall it takes a minimum of seven years before an architecture student can seek chartered status .
even as animal domestication became relatively widespread and after the development of agriculture , hunting was usually a significant contributor to the human food supply . the supplementary meat and materials from hunting included protein , bone for implements , sinew for cordage , fur , feathers , rawhide and leather used in clothing . man 's earliest hunting weapons would have included rocks , spears , the atlatl , and bows and arrows . hunting is still vital in marginal climates , especially those unsuited for pastoral uses or agriculture . [ citation needed ] for example , inuit people in the arctic trap and hunt animals for clothing and use the skins of sea mammals to make kayaks , clothing , and footwear .
patasse purged many of the kolingba elements from the government and kolingba supporters accused patasse 's government of conducting a " witch hunt " against the yakoma . a new constitution was approved on 28 december 1994 but had little impact on the country 's politics . in 1996-1997 , reflecting steadily decreasing public confidence in the government 's erratic behaviour , three mutinies against patasse 's administration were accompanied by widespread destruction of property and heightened ethnic tension . during this time ( 1996 ) the peace corps evacuated all its volunteers to neighboring cameroon . to date , the peace corps has not returned to the central african republic . the bangui agreements , signed in january 1997 , provided for the deployment of an inter-african military mission , to central african republic and re-entry of ex-mutineers into the government on 7 april 1997 . the inter-african military mission was later replaced by a u.n. peacekeeping force ( minurca ) .
kathmandu is located in the northwestern part of the kathmandu valley to the north of the bagmati river and covers an area of 50.67 km2 ( 19.56 sq mi ) . the average elevation is 1,400 metres ( 4,600 ft ) above sea level . the city is directly bounded by several other municipalities of the kathmandu valley : south of the bagmati by lalitpur sub-metropolitan city ( patan ) with which it today forms one urban area surrounded by a ring road , to the southwest by kirtipur municipality and to the east by madyapur thimi municipality . to the north the urban area extends into several village development committees . however , the urban agglomeration extends well beyond the neighboring municipalities , e. g. to bhaktapur and just about covers the entire kathmandu valley .
christianity ( 59 % ) , particularly catholicism ( 33 % ) , was the most prevalently practiced religion in new york as of 2014 , followed by judaism , with approximately 1.1 million jews in new york city , over half living in brooklyn . islam ranks third in new york city , with official estimates ranging between 600,000 and 1,000,000 observers and including 10 % of the city 's public schoolchildren , followed by hinduism , buddhism , and a variety of other religions , as well as atheism . in 2014 , 24 % self-identified with no organized religious affiliation .
the feynman lectures on physics is perhaps his most accessible work for anyone with an interest in physics , compiled from lectures to caltech undergraduates in 1961-64 . as news of the lectures ' lucidity grew , professional physicists and graduate students began to drop in to listen . co-authors robert b. leighton and matthew sands , colleagues of feynman , edited and illustrated them into book form . the work has endured and is useful to this day . they were edited and supplemented in 2005 with " feynman 's tips on physics : a problem-solving supplement to the feynman lectures on physics " by michael gottlieb and ralph leighton ( robert leighton 's son ) , with support from kip thorne and other physicists .
in addition to city government , numerous commissions and state authorities - including the massachusetts department of conservation and recreation , the boston public health commission , the massachusetts water resources authority ( mwra ) , and the massachusetts port authority ( massport ) - play a role in the life of bostonians . as the capital of massachusetts , boston plays a major role in state politics .
federal law and treaties , so long as they are in accordance with the constitution , preempt conflicting state and territorial laws in the 50 u.s. states and in the territories . however , the scope of federal preemption is limited because the scope of federal power is not universal . in the dual-sovereign system of american federalism ( actually tripartite because of the presence of indian reservations ) , states are the plenary sovereigns , each with their own constitution , while the federal sovereign possesses only the limited supreme authority enumerated in the constitution . indeed , states may grant their citizens broader rights than the federal constitution as long as they do not infringe on any federal constitutional rights . thus , most u.s. law ( especially the actual " living law " of contract , tort , property , criminal , and family law experienced by the majority of citizens on a day-to-day basis ) consists primarily of state law , which can and does vary greatly from one state to the next .
in the early 21st century the cypriot economy has diversified and become prosperous . however , in 2012 it became affected by the eurozone financial and banking crisis . in june 2012 , the cypriot government announced it would need € 1.8 billion in foreign aid to support the cyprus popular bank , and this was followed by fitch downgrading cyprus 's credit rating to junk status . fitch said cyprus would need an additional € 4 billion to support its banks and the downgrade was mainly due to the exposure of bank of cyprus , cyprus popular bank and hellenic bank , cyprus 's three largest banks , to the greek financial crisis .
on the morning of march 28 , 1969 , at the age of 78 , eisenhower died in washington , d.c. of congestive heart failure at walter reed army medical center . the following day his body was moved to the washington national cathedral 's bethlehem chapel , where he lay in repose for 28 hours . on march 30 , his body was brought by caisson to the united states capitol , where he lay in state in the capitol rotunda . on march 31 , eisenhower 's body was returned to the national cathedral , where he was given an episcopal church funeral service .
the modern spelling , tennessee , is attributed to james glen , the governor of south carolina , who used this spelling in his official correspondence during the 1750s . the spelling was popularized by the publication of henry timberlake 's " draught of the cherokee country " in 1765 . in 1788 , north carolina created " tennessee county , " the third county to be established in what is now middle tennessee . ( tennessee county was the predecessor to current-day montgomery county and robertson county . ) when a constitutional convention met in 1796 to organize a new state out of the southwest territory , it adopted " tennessee " as the name of the state .
beginning in april 1985 , madonna embarked on her first concert tour in north america , the virgin tour , with the beastie boys as her opening act . she progressed from playing cbgb and the mudd club to playing large sporting arenas . at that time she released two more hit singles from the album , " angel " and " dress you up . " in july , penthouse and playboy magazines published a number of nude photos of madonna , taken in new york in 1978 . she had posed for the photographs as she needed money at the time , and was paid as little as $ 25 a session . the publication of the photos caused a media uproar , but madonna remained " unapologetic and defiant . " the photographs were ultimately sold for up to $ 100,000 . she referred to these events at the 1985 outdoor live aid charity concert , saying that she would not take her jacket off because " [ the media ] might hold it against me ten years from now . "
christianity , judaism , zoroastrianism , and the sunni branch of islam are officially recognized by the government , and have reserved seats in the iranian parliament . but the baha 'i faith , which is said to be the largest non-muslim religious minority in iran , is not officially recognized , and has been persecuted during its existence in iran since the 19th century . since the 1979 revolution , the persecution of bahais has increased with executions , the denial of civil rights and liberties , and the denial of access to higher education and employment .
only 14 % of the population speaks portuguese , established as the official language in the colonial period . almost half the population ( 44 % ) speaks crioulo , a portuguese-based creole language , and the remainder speak a variety of native african languages . the main religions are african traditional religions and islam ; there is a christian ( mostly roman catholic ) minority . the country 's per-capita gross domestic product is one of the lowest in the world .
in 1950 , hayek left the london school of economics for the university of chicago , where he became a professor in the committee on social thought . hayek 's salary was funded not by the university , but by an outside foundation . university of chicago president robert hutchins was in the midst of a war with the u. of chicago faculty over departmental autonomy and control , and hayek got caught in the middle of that battle . hutchins had been attempting to force all departments to adopt the neo-thomist great books program of mortimer adler , and the u. of chicago economists were sick of hutchins ' meddling . as the result the economics department rejected hutchins ' pressure to hire hayek , and hayek became a part of the new committee on social thought .
the tuvalu government carried out assessments of the damage caused by cyclone pam to the islands and has provided medical aid , food as well as assistance for the cleaning-up of storm debris . government and non-government organisations provided assistance technical , funding and material support to tuvalu to assist with recovery , including who , unicef , undp , ocha , world bank , dfat , new zealand red cross & ifrc , fiji national university and governments of new zealand , netherlands , uae , taiwan and the united states .
in 1671 , robert boyle discovered and described the reaction between iron filings and dilute acids , which results in the production of hydrogen gas . in 1766 , henry cavendish was the first to recognize hydrogen gas as a discrete substance , by naming the gas from a metal-acid reaction " flammable air . " he speculated that " flammable air " was in fact identical to the hypothetical substance called " phlogiston " and further finding in 1781 that the gas produces water when burned . he is usually given credit for its discovery as an element . in 1783 , antoine lavoisier gave the element the name hydrogen ( from the greek υδρο- hydro meaning " water " and -γενης genes meaning " creator " ) when he and laplace reproduced cavendish 's finding that water is produced when hydrogen is burned .
within the diasporan armenian community , there is an unofficial classification of the different kinds of armenians . for example , armenians who originate from iran are referred to as parskahay ( պարսկահայ ) , while armenians from lebanon are usually referred to as lipananahay ( լիբանանահայ ) . armenians of the diaspora are the primary speakers of the western dialect of the armenian language . this dialect has considerable differences with eastern armenian , but speakers of either of the two variations can usually understand each other . eastern armenian in the diaspora is primarily spoken in iran and european countries such as ukraine , russia , and georgia ( where they form a majority in the samtskhe-javakheti province ) . in diverse communities ( such as in canada and the u.s. ) where many different kinds of armenians live together , there is a tendency for the different groups to cluster together .
jewish historians also note that certain customs of today 's orthodox are not continuations of past practice , but instead represent innovations that would have been unknown to prior generations . for example , the now-widespread haredi tradition of cutting a boy 's hair for the first time on his third birthday ( upshirin or upsheerin , yiddish for " haircut " ) " originated as an arab custom that parents cut a newborn boy 's hair and burned it in a fire as a sacrifice , " and " jews in palestine learned this custom from arabs and adapted it to a special jewish context . " the ashkenazi prohibition against eating kitniyot ( grains and legumes such as rice , corn , beans , and peanuts ) during passover was explicitly rejected in the talmud , has no known precedent before the 12th century and represented a minority position for hundreds of years thereafter , but nonetheless has remained a mandatory prohibition among ashkenazi orthodox jews due to their historic adherence to the rema 's rulings in the shulchan aruch .
the legislative assembly of the federal district is formed , as it is the case in all legislatures in mexico , by both single-seat and proportional seats , making it a system of parallel voting . the federal district is divided into 40 electoral constituencies of similar population which elect one representative by first-past-the-post plurality ( fpp ) , locally called " uninominal deputies . " the federal district as a whole constitutes a single constituency for the parallel election of 26 representatives by proportionality ( pr ) with open-party lists , locally called " plurinominal deputies . "
for the popular taste however , light music , particularly ghazals and folk songs , which have an appeal of their own , the names of mehdi hassan , ghulam ali , nur jehan , malika pukhraj , farida khanum , roshen ara begum , and nusrat fateh ali khan are well-known . folk songs and dances of the punjab reflect a wide range of moods : the rains , sowing and harvesting seasons . luddi , bhangra and sammi depict the joy of living . love legends of heer ranjha , mirza sahiban , sohni mahenwal and saiful mulk are sung in different styles .
around 746 , abu muslim assumed leadership of the hashimiyya in khurasan . in 747 , he successfully initiated an open revolt against umayyad rule , which was carried out under the sign of the black flag . he soon established control of khurasan , expelling its umayyad governor , nasr ibn sayyar , and dispatched an army westwards . kufa fell to the hashimiyya in 749 , the last umayyad stronghold in iraq , wasit , was placed under siege , and in november of the same year abu al-abbas was recognized as the new caliph in the mosque at kufa . [ citation needed ] at this point marwan mobilized his troops from harran and advanced toward iraq . in january 750 the two forces met in the battle of the zab , and the umayyads were defeated . damascus fell to the abbasids in april , and in august , marwan was killed in egypt .
throughout the industrial revolution , plymouth grew as a commercial shipping port , handling imports and passengers from the americas , and exporting local minerals ( tin , copper , lime , china clay and arsenic ) while the neighbouring town of devonport became a strategic royal naval shipbuilding and dockyard town . in 1914 three neighbouring independent towns , viz . , the county borough of plymouth , the county borough of devonport , and the urban district of east stonehouse were merged to form a single county borough . the combined town took the name of plymouth which , in 1928 , achieved city status . the city 's naval importance later led to its targeting and partial destruction during world war ii , an act known as the plymouth blitz . after the war the city centre was completely rebuilt and subsequent expansion led to the incorporation of plympton and plymstock along with other outlying suburbs in 1967 .
ninety-five percent of bird species are socially monogamous . these species pair for at least the length of the breeding season or - in some cases - for several years or until the death of one mate . monogamy allows for both paternal care and biparental care , which is especially important for species in which females require males ' assistance for successful brood-rearing . among many socially monogamous species , extra-pair copulation ( infidelity ) is common . such behaviour typically occurs between dominant males and females paired with subordinate males , but may also be the result of forced copulation in ducks and other anatids . female birds have sperm storage mechanisms that allow sperm from males to remain viable long after copulation , a hundred days in some species . sperm from multiple males may compete through this mechanism . for females , possible benefits of extra-pair copulation include getting better genes for her offspring and insuring against the possibility of infertility in her mate . males of species that engage in extra-pair copulations will closely guard their mates to ensure the parentage of the offspring that they raise .
peasant society is much less documented than the nobility . most of the surviving information available to historians comes from archaeology ; few detailed written records documenting peasant life remain from before the 9th century . most the descriptions of the lower classes come from either law codes or writers from the upper classes . landholding patterns in the west were not uniform ; some areas had greatly fragmented landholding patterns , but in other areas large contiguous blocks of land were the norm . these differences allowed for a wide variety of peasant societies , some dominated by aristocratic landholders and others having a great deal of autonomy . land settlement also varied greatly . some peasants lived in large settlements that numbered as many as 700 inhabitants . others lived in small groups of a few families and still others lived on isolated farms spread over the countryside . there were also areas where the pattern was a mix of two or more of those systems . unlike in the late roman period , there was no sharp break between the legal status of the free peasant and the aristocrat , and it was possible for a free peasant 's family to rise into the aristocracy over several generations through military service to a powerful lord .
back in warsaw that year , chopin heard niccolo paganini play the violin , and composed a set of variations , souvenir de paganini . it may have been this experience which encouraged him to commence writing his first etudes , ( 1829-32 ) , exploring the capacities of his own instrument . on 11 august , three weeks after completing his studies at the warsaw conservatory , he made his debut in vienna . he gave two piano concerts and received many favourable reviews - in addition to some commenting ( in chopin 's own words ) that he was " too delicate for those accustomed to the piano-bashing of local artists . " in one of these concerts , he premiered his variations on la ci darem la mano , op. 2 ( variations on an aria from mozart 's opera don giovanni ) for piano and orchestra . he returned to warsaw in september 1829 , where he premiered his piano concerto no. 2 in f minor , op. 21 on 17 march 1830 .
insects were the earliest organisms to produce and sense sounds . insects make sounds mostly by mechanical action of appendages . in grasshoppers and crickets , this is achieved by stridulation . cicadas make the loudest sounds among the insects by producing and amplifying sounds with special modifications to their body and musculature . the african cicada brevisana brevis has been measured at 106.7 decibels at a distance of 50 cm ( 20 in ) . some insects , such as the helicoverpa zeamoths , hawk moths and hedylid butterflies , can hear ultrasound and take evasive action when they sense that they have been detected by bats . some moths produce ultrasonic clicks that were once thought to have a role in jamming bat echolocation . the ultrasonic clicks were subsequently found to be produced mostly by unpalatable moths to warn bats , just as warning colorations are used against predators that hunt by sight . some otherwise palatable moths have evolved to mimic these calls . more recently , the claim that some moths can jam bat sonar has been revisited . ultrasonic recording and high-speed infrared videography of bat-moth interactions suggest the palatable tiger moth really does defend against attacking big brown bats using ultrasonic clicks that jam bat sonar .
about the creation-evolution controversy , popper wrote that he considered it " a somewhat sensational clash between a brilliant scientific hypothesis concerning the history of the various species of animals and plants on earth , and an older metaphysical theory which , incidentally , happened to be part of an established religious belief " with a footnote to the effect that " [ he ] agree [ s ] with professor c.e. raven when , in his science , religion , and the future , 1943 , he calls this conflict " a storm in a victorian tea-cup " ; though the force of this remark is perhaps a little impaired by the attention he pays to the vapours still emerging from the cup - to the great systems of evolutionist philosophy , produced by bergson , whitehead , smuts , and others . "
evidence of han-era mechanical engineering comes largely from the choice observational writings of sometimes disinterested confucian scholars . professional artisan-engineers ( jiang 匠 ) did not leave behind detailed records of their work . han scholars , who often had little or no expertise in mechanical engineering , sometimes provided insufficient information on the various technologies they described . nevertheless , some han literary sources provide crucial information . for example , in 15 bc the philosopher yang xiong described the invention of the belt drive for a quilling machine , which was of great importance to early textile manufacturing . the inventions of the artisan-engineer ding huan ( 丁緩 ) are mentioned in the miscellaneous notes on the western capital . around 180 ad , ding created a manually operated rotary fan used for air conditioning within palace buildings . ding also used gimbals as pivotal supports for one of his incense burners and invented the world 's first known zoetrope lamp .
the joan b. kroc institute for international peace studies at the university of notre dame is dedicated to research , education and outreach on the causes of violent conflict and the conditions for sustainable peace . it offers phd , master 's , and undergraduate degrees in peace studies . it was founded in 1986 through the donations of joan b. kroc , the widow of mcdonald 's owner ray kroc . the institute was inspired by the vision of the rev. theodore m. hesburgh csc , president emeritus of the university of notre dame . the institute has contributed to international policy discussions about peace building practices .
with this contribution of von neumann , the axiomatic system of the theory of sets became fully satisfactory , and the next question was whether or not it was also definitive , and not subject to improvement . a strongly negative answer arrived in september 1930 at the historic mathematical congress of konigsberg , in which kurt godel announced his first theorem of incompleteness : the usual axiomatic systems are incomplete , in the sense that they cannot prove every truth which is expressible in their language . this result was sufficiently innovative as to confound the majority of mathematicians of the time .
the scientific evidence is mixed as to whether companionship of a dog can enhance human physical health and psychological wellbeing . studies suggesting that there are benefits to physical health and psychological wellbeing have been criticised for being poorly controlled , and finding that " [ t ] he health of elderly people is related to their health habits and social supports but not to their ownership of , or attachment to , a companion animal . " earlier studies have shown that people who keep pet dogs or cats exhibit better mental and physical health than those who do not , making fewer visits to the doctor and being less likely to be on medication than non-guardians .

weinreich 's identity variant similarly includes the categories of identity diffusion , foreclosure and crisis , but with a somewhat different emphasis . here , with respect to identity diffusion for example , an optimal level is interpreted as the norm , as it is unrealistic to expect an individual to resolve all their conflicted identifications with others ; therefore we should be alert to individuals with levels which are much higher or lower than the norm - highly diffused individuals are classified as diffused , and those with low levels as foreclosed or defensive . ( weinreich & saunderson , 2003 , pp 65-67 ; 105-106 ) . weinreich applies the identity variant in a framework which also allows for the transition from one to another by way of biographical experiences and resolution of conflicted identifications situated in various contexts - for example , an adolescent going through family break-up may be in one state , whereas later in a stable marriage with a secure professional role may be in another . hence , though there is continuity , there is also development and change . ( weinreich & saunderson , 2003 , pp 22-23 ) .
neptune has a number of known trojan objects occupying both the sun-neptune l4 and l5 lagrangian points - gravitationally stable regions leading and trailing neptune in its orbit , respectively . neptune trojans can be viewed as being in a 1 : 1 resonance with neptune . some neptune trojans are remarkably stable in their orbits , and are likely to have formed alongside neptune rather than being captured . the first and so far only object identified as associated with neptune 's trailing l5 lagrangian point is 2008 lc18 . neptune also has a temporary quasi-satellite , ( 309239 ) 2007 rw10 . the object has been a quasi-satellite of neptune for about 12,500 years and it will remain in that dynamical state for another 12,500 years .

originally , legislative power was exercised by the sovereign acting on the advice of the curia regis , or royal council , in which important magnates and clerics participated and which evolved into parliament . the so-called model parliament included bishops , abbots , earls , barons , and two knights from each shire and two burgesses from each borough among its members . in 1265 , the earl of leicester irregularly called a full parliament without royal authorisation . the body eventually came to be divided into two branches : bishops , abbots , earls , and barons formed the house of lords , while the shire and borough representatives formed the house of commons . the king would seek the advice and consent of both houses before making any law . during henry vi 's reign , it became regular practice for the two houses to originate legislation in the form of bills , which would not become law unless the sovereign 's assent was obtained , as the sovereign was , and still remains , the enactor of laws . hence , all acts include the clause " be it enacted by the queen 's ( king 's ) most excellent majesty , by and with the advice and consent of the lords spiritual and temporal , and commons , in this present parliament assembled , and by the authority of the same , as follows .... " the parliament acts 1911 and 1949 provide a second potential preamble if the house of lords were to be excluded from the process .

replacing the classical physics in use since the end of the scientific revolution , modern physics arose in the early 20th century with the advent of quantum physics , substituting mathematical studies for experimental studies and examining equations to build a theoretical structure . [ citation needed ] the old quantum theory was a collection of results which predate modern quantum mechanics , but were never complete or self-consistent . the collection of heuristic prescriptions for quantum mechanics were the first corrections to classical mechanics . outside the realm of quantum physics , the various aether theories in classical physics , which supposed a " fifth element " such as the luminiferous aether , were nullified by the michelson-morley experiment - an attempt to detect the motion of earth through the aether . in biology , darwinism gained acceptance , promoting the concept of adaptation in the theory of natural selection . the fields of geology , astronomy and psychology also made strides and gained new insights . in medicine , there were advances in medical theory and treatments .

some researchers are now focusing on learning about how adolescents view their own relationships and sexuality ; they want to move away from a research point of view that focuses on the problems associated with adolescent sexuality . [ why ? ] college professor lucia o 'sullivan and her colleagues found that there weren 't any significant gender differences in the relationship events adolescent boys and girls from grades 7-12 reported . most teens said they had kissed their partners , held hands with them , thought of themselves as being a couple and told people they were in a relationship . this means that private thoughts about the relationship as well as public recognition of the relationship were both important to the adolescents in the sample . sexual events ( such as sexual touching , sexual intercourse ) were less common than romantic events ( holding hands ) and social events ( being with one 's partner in a group setting ) . the researchers state that these results are important because the results focus on the more positive aspects of adolescents and their social and romantic interactions rather than focusing on sexual behavior and its consequences .

this technique of representing simultaneity , multiple viewpoints ( or relative motion ) is pushed to a high degree of complexity in gleizes ' monumental le depiquage des moissons ( harvest threshing ) , exhibited at the 1912 salon de la section d 'or , le fauconnier 's abundance shown at the independants of 1911 , and delaunay 's city of paris , shown at the independants in 1912 . these ambitious works are some of the largest paintings in the history of cubism . leger 's the wedding , also shown at the salon des independants in 1912 , gave form to the notion of simultaneity by presenting different motifs as occurring within a single temporal frame , where responses to the past and present interpenetrate with collective force . the conjunction of such subject matter with simultaneity aligns salon cubism with early futurist paintings by umberto boccioni , gino severini and carlo carra ; themselves made in response to early cubism .

the latin alphabet of the time still lacked the letters ⟨ j ⟩ and ⟨ w ⟩ , and there was no ⟨ v ⟩ as distinct from ⟨ u ⟩ ; moreover native old english spellings did not use ⟨ k ⟩ , ⟨ q ⟩ or ⟨ z ⟩ . the remaining 20 latin letters were supplemented by four more : ⟨ æ ⟩ ( æsc , modern ash ) and ⟨ ð ⟩ ( ðæt , now called eth or edh ) , which were modified latin letters , and thorn ⟨ þ ⟩ and wynn ⟨ ƿ ⟩ , which are borrowings from the futhorc . a few letter pairs were used as digraphs , representing a single sound . also used was the tironian note ⟨ ⁊ ⟩ ( a character similar to the digit 7 ) for the conjunction and , and a thorn with a crossbar through the ascender for the pronoun þæt . macrons over vowels were originally used not to mark long vowels ( as in modern editions ) , but to indicate stress , or as abbreviations for a following m or n .

london contains four world heritage sites : the tower of london ; kew gardens ; the site comprising the palace of westminster , westminster abbey , and st margaret 's church ; and the historic settlement of greenwich ( in which the royal observatory , greenwich marks the prime meridian , 0 ° longitude , and gmt ) . other famous landmarks include buckingham palace , the london eye , piccadilly circus , st paul 's cathedral , tower bridge , trafalgar square , and the shard . london is home to numerous museums , galleries , libraries , sporting events and other cultural institutions , including the british museum , national gallery , tate modern , british library and 40 west end theatres . the london underground is the oldest underground railway network in the world .
the armenian army , air force , air defence , and border guard comprise the four branches of the armed forces of the republic of armenia . the armenian military was formed after the collapse of the soviet union in 1991 and with the establishment of the ministry of defence in 1992 . the commander-in-chief of the military is the president of armenia , serzh sargsyan . the ministry of defence is in charge of political leadership , currently headed by colonel general seyran ohanyan , while military command remains in the hands of the general staff , headed by the chief of staff , who is currently colonel general yuri khatchaturov .
the early cretaceous spans from 145 million to 100 million years ago . the early cretaceous saw the expansion of seaways , and as a result , the decline and extinction of sauropods ( except in south america ) . many coastal shallows were created , and that caused ichthyosaurs to die out . mosasaurs evolved to replace them as head of the seas . some island-hopping dinosaurs , like eustreptospondylus , evolved to cope with the coastal shallows and small islands of ancient europe . other dinosaurs rose up to fill the empty space that the jurassic-cretaceous extinction left behind , such as carcharodontosaurus and spinosaurus . of the most successful would be the iguanodon which spread to every continent . seasons came back into effect and the poles got seasonally colder , but dinosaurs still inhabited this area like the leaellynasaura which inhabited the polar forests year-round , and many dinosaurs migrated there during summer like muttaburrasaurus . since it was too cold for crocodiles , it was the last stronghold for large amphibians , like koolasuchus . pterosaurs got larger as species like tapejara and ornithocheirus evolved .
despite the large number of philosophical schools and subtle nuances between many , all philosophies are said to fall into one of two primary categories , which are defined in contrast to each other : idealism , and materialism . [ a ] the basic proposition of these two categories pertains to the nature of reality , and the primary distinction between them is the way they answer two fundamental questions : " what does reality consist of ? " and " how does it originate ? " to idealists , spirit or mind or the objects of mind ( ideas ) are primary , and matter secondary . to materialists , matter is primary , and mind or spirit or ideas are secondary , the product of matter acting upon matter .
american idol became the most expensive series on broadcast networks for advertisers starting season four , and by the next season , it had broken the record in advertising rate for a regularly scheduled prime-time network series , selling over $ 700,000 for a 30-seconds slot , and reaching up to $ 1.3 million for the finale . its ad prices reached a peak in season seven at $ 737,000 . estimated revenue more than doubled from $ 404 million in season three to $ 870 million in season six . while that declined from season eight onwards , it still earned significantly more than its nearest competitor , with advertising revenue topping $ 800 million annually the next few seasons . however , the sharp drop in ratings in season eleven also resulted in a sharp drop in advertising rate for season twelve , and the show lost its leading position as the costliest show for advertisers . by 2014 , ad revenue from had fallen to $ 427 million where a 30-second spot went for less than $ 300,000 .
the transcribed pre-mrna contains untranslated regions at both ends which contain a ribosome binding site , terminator and start and stop codons . in addition , most eukaryotic open reading frames contain untranslated introns which are removed before the exons are translated . the sequences at the ends of the introns , dictate the splice sites to generate the final mature mrna which encodes the protein or rna product .
interestingly , research has revealed that asking individuals to repeatedly imagine actions that they have never performed or events that they have never experienced could result in false memories . for instance , goff and roediger ( 1998 ) asked participants to imagine that they performed an act ( e.g. , break a toothpick ) and then later asked them whether they had done such a thing . findings revealed that those participants who repeatedly imagined performing such an act were more likely to think that they had actually performed that act during the first session of the experiment . similarly , garry and her colleagues ( 1996 ) asked college students to report how certain they were that they experienced a number of events as children ( e.g. , broke a window with their hand ) and then two weeks later asked them to imagine four of those events . the researchers found that one-fourth of the students asked to imagine the four events reported that they had actually experienced such events as children . that is , when asked to imagine the events they were more confident that they experienced the events .
real estate is a major force in the city 's economy , as the total value of all new york city property was assessed at us $ 914.8 billion for the 2015 fiscal year . the time warner center is the property with the highest-listed market value in the city , at us $ 1.1 billion in 2006 . new york city is home to some of the nation 's - and the world 's - most valuable real estate . 450 park avenue was sold on july 2 , 2007 for us $ 510 million , about $ 1,589 per square foot ( $ 17,104 / m ² ) , breaking the barely month-old record for an american office building of $ 1,476 per square foot ( $ 15,887 / m ² ) set in the june 2007 sale of 660 madison avenue . according to forbes , in 2014 , manhattan was home to six of the top ten zip codes in the united states by median housing price .
although the estonian and germanic languages are of very different origins , one can identify many similar words in estonian and english , for example . this is primarily because the estonian language has borrowed nearly one third of its vocabulary from germanic languages , mainly from low saxon ( middle low german ) during the period of german rule , and high german ( including standard german ) . the percentage of low saxon and high german loanwords can be estimated at 22-25 percent , with low saxon making up about 15 percent .

almost all animals are capable of modifying their behavior as a result of experience - even the most primitive types of worms . because behavior is driven by brain activity , changes in behavior must somehow correspond to changes inside the brain . theorists dating back to santiago ramon y cajal argued that the most plausible explanation is that learning and memory are expressed as changes in the synaptic connections between neurons . until 1970 , however , experimental evidence to support the synaptic plasticity hypothesis was lacking . in 1971 tim bliss and terje lømo published a paper on a phenomenon now called long-term potentiation : the paper showed clear evidence of activity-induced synaptic changes that lasted for at least several days . since then technical advances have made these sorts of experiments much easier to carry out , and thousands of studies have been made that have clarified the mechanism of synaptic change , and uncovered other types of activity-driven synaptic change in a variety of brain areas , including the cerebral cortex , hippocampus , basal ganglia , and cerebellum . brain-derived neurotrophic factor ( bdnf ) and physical activity appear to play a beneficial role in the process .
however , as stealth technology grows , so does anti-stealth technology . multiple transmitter radars such as those from bistatic radars and low-frequency radars are said to have the capabilities to detect stealth aircraft . advanced forms of thermographic cameras such as those that incorporate qwips would be able to optically see a stealth aircraft regardless of the aircraft 's rcs . in addition , side looking radars , high-powered optical satellites , and sky-scanning , high-aperture , high sensitivity radars such as radio telescopes , would all be able to narrow down the location of a stealth aircraft under certain parameters . the newest sam 's have a claimed ability to be able to detect and engage stealth targets , with the most notable being the s-400 , which is claimed to be able to detect a target with a 0.05 meter squared rcs from 90 km away .
the ming dynasty granted titles to lamas of schools such as the karmapa kargyu , but the latter had previously declined mongol invitations to receive titles . when the ming yongle emperor invited je tsongkhapa ( 1357-1419 ) , founder of the gelug school , to come to the ming court and pay tribute , the latter declined . wang and nyima write that this was due to old age and physical weakness , and also because of efforts being made to build three major monasteries . chen qingying states that tsongkhapa wrote a letter to decline the emperor 's invitation , and in this reply , tsongkhapa wrote :
the original post-punk movement ended as the bands associated with the movement turned away from its aesthetics , often in favor of more commercial sounds . many of these groups would continue recording as part of the new pop movement , with entryism becoming a popular concept . in the united states , driven by mtv and modern rock radio stations , a number of post-punk acts had an influence on or became part of the second british invasion of " new music " there . some shifted to a more commercial new wave sound ( such as gang of four ) , while others were fixtures on american college radio and became early examples of alternative rock . perhaps the most successful band to emerge from post-punk was u2 , who combined elements of religious imagery together with political commentary into their often anthemic music .
in the early hours of 7 december ( hawaiian time ) , japan launched a major surprise carrier-based air strike on pearl harbor without explicit warning , which crippled the u.s. pacific fleet , leaving eight american battleships out of action , 188 american aircraft destroyed , and 2,403 american citizens dead . at the time of the attack , the u.s. was not officially at war anywhere in the world , which means that the people killed or property destroyed at pearl harbor by the japanese attack had a non-combatant status . [ nb 11 ] the japanese had gambled that the united states , when faced with such a sudden and massive blow , would agree to a negotiated settlement and allow japan free rein in asia . this gamble did not pay off . american losses were less serious than initially thought : the american aircraft carriers , which would prove to be more important than battleships , were at sea , and vital naval infrastructure ( fuel oil tanks , shipyard facilities , and a power station ) , submarine base , and signals intelligence units were unscathed . japan 's fallback strategy , relying on a war of attrition to make the u.s. come to terms , was beyond the ijn 's capabilities .
fighting on one side was a coalition of forces including the republic of vietnam ( south vietnam or the " rvn " ) , the united states , supplemented by south korea , thailand , australia , new zealand , and the philippines . the allies fought against the north vietnamese army ( nva ) as well as the national liberation front ( nlf , also known as viet communists viet cong ) , or " vc , " a guerrilla force within south vietnam . the nva received substantial military and economic aid from the soviet union and china , turning vietnam into a proxy war .
in 2000 , madonna starred in the film the next best thing , and contributed two songs to the film 's soundtrack ; " time stood still " and a cover of don mclean 's 1971 song " american pie . " she released her eighth studio album , music , in september 2000 . it featured elements from the electronica-inspired ray of light era , and like its predecessor , received acclaim from critics . collaborating with french producer mirwais ahmadzai , madonna commented : " i love to work with the weirdos that no one knows about - the people who have raw talent and who are making music unlike anyone else out there . music is the future of sound . " stephen thomas erlewine from allmusic felt that " music blows by in a kaleidoscopic rush of color , technique , style and substance . it has so many depth and layers that it 's easily as self-aware and earnest as ray of light . " the album took the number-one position in more than 20 countries worldwide and sold four million copies in the first ten days . in the u.s. , music debuted at the top , and became her first number-one album in eleven years since like a prayer . it produced three singles : the hot 100 number one " music , " " don 't tell me , " and " what it feels like for a girl . " the music video of " what it feels like for a girl " depicted madonna committing acts of crime and vandalism , and was banned by mtv and vh1 .
european art music is largely distinguished from many other non-european and popular musical forms by its system of staff notation , in use since about the 16th century . western staff notation is used by composers to prescribe to the performer the pitches ( e.g. , melodies , basslines and / or chords ) , tempo , meter and rhythms for a piece of music . this leaves less room for practices such as improvisation and ad libitum ornamentation , which are frequently heard in non-european art music and in popular music styles such as jazz and blues . another difference is that whereas most popular styles lend themselves to the song form , classical music has been noted for its development of highly sophisticated forms of instrumental music such as the concerto , symphony , sonata , and mixed vocal and instrumental styles such as opera which , since they are written down , can attain a high level of complexity .
avialans diversified into a wide variety of forms during the cretaceous period . many groups retained primitive characteristics , such as clawed wings and teeth , though the latter were lost independently in a number of avialan groups , including modern birds ( aves ) . while the earliest forms , such as archaeopteryx and jeholornis , retained the long bony tails of their ancestors , the tails of more advanced avialans were shortened with the advent of the pygostyle bone in the group pygostylia . in the late cretaceous , around 95 million years ago , the ancestor of all modern birds also evolved a better sense of smell .
the early middle ages witnessed the rise of monasticism in the west . the shape of european monasticism was determined by traditions and ideas that originated with the desert fathers of egypt and syria . most european monasteries were of the type that focuses on community experience of the spiritual life , called cenobitism , which was pioneered by pachomius ( d . 348 ) in the 4th century . monastic ideals spread from egypt to western europe in the 5th and 6th centuries through hagiographical literature such as the life of anthony . benedict of nursia ( d . 547 ) wrote the benedictine rule for western monasticism during the 6th century , detailing the administrative and spiritual responsibilities of a community of monks led by an abbot . monks and monasteries had a deep effect on the religious and political life of the early middle ages , in various cases acting as land trusts for powerful families , centres of propaganda and royal support in newly conquered regions , and bases for missions and proselytisation . they were the main and sometimes only outposts of education and literacy in a region . many of the surviving manuscripts of the latin classics were copied in monasteries in the early middle ages . monks were also the authors of new works , including history , theology , and other subjects , written by authors such as bede ( d . 735 ) , a native of northern england who wrote in the late 7th and early 8th centuries .
purebred dogs of one breed are genetically distinguishable from purebred dogs of other breeds , but the means by which kennel clubs classify dogs is unsystematic . systematic analyses of the dog genome has revealed only four major types of dogs that can be said to be statistically distinct . these include the " old world dogs " ( e.g. , malamute and shar pei ) , " mastiff " -type ( e.g. , english mastiff ) , " herding " -type ( e.g. , border collie ) , and " all others " ( also called " modern " - or " hunting " -type ) .
recent studies , as by the apg , show that the monocots form a monophyletic group ( clade ) but that the dicots do not ( they are paraphyletic ) . nevertheless , the majority of dicot species do form a monophyletic group , called the eudicots or tricolpates . of the remaining dicot species , most belong to a third major clade known as the magnoliids , containing about 9,000 species . the rest include a paraphyletic grouping of primitive species known collectively as the basal angiosperms , plus the families ceratophyllaceae and chloranthaceae .
the defence estate is divided as training areas & ranges ( 84.0 % ) , research & development ( 5.4 % ) , airfields ( 3.4 % ) , barracks & camps ( 2.5 % ) , storage & supply depots ( 1.6 % ) , and other ( 3.0 % ) . these are largely managed by the defence infrastructure organisation .
directly underneath the state apartments is a suite of slightly less grand rooms known as the semi-state apartments . opening from the marble hall , these rooms are used for less formal entertaining , such as luncheon parties and private audiences . some of the rooms are named and decorated for particular visitors , such as the 1844 room , decorated in that year for the state visit of tsar nicholas i of russia , and , on the other side of the bow room , the 1855 room , in honour of the visit of emperor napoleon iii of france . at the centre of this suite is the bow room , through which thousands of guests pass annually to the queen 's garden parties in the gardens . the queen and prince philip use a smaller suite of rooms in the north wing .
he assumed duties again at camp meade , maryland , commanding a battalion of tanks , where he remained until 1922 . his schooling continued , focused on the nature of the next war and the role of the tank in it . his new expertise in tank warfare was strengthened by a close collaboration with george s. patton , sereno e. brett , and other senior tank leaders . their leading-edge ideas of speed-oriented offensive tank warfare were strongly discouraged by superiors , who considered the new approach too radical and preferred to continue using tanks in a strictly supportive role for the infantry . eisenhower was even threatened with court martial for continued publication of these proposed methods of tank deployment , and he relented .
the soviets kept the details and true appearance of the vostok capsule secret until the april 1965 moscow economic exhibition , where it was first displayed without its aerodynamic nose cone concealing the spherical capsule . the " vostok spaceship " had been first displayed at the july 1961 tushino air show , mounted on its launch vehicle 's third stage , with the nose cone in place . a tail section with eight fins was also added , in an apparent attempt to confuse western observers . this spurious tail section also appeared on official commemorative stamps and a documentary .
the name ipod was proposed by vinnie chieco , a freelance copywriter , who ( with others ) was called by apple to figure out how to introduce the new player to the public . after chieco saw a prototype , he thought of the movie 2001 : a space odyssey and the phrase " open the pod bay door , hal ! , " which refers to the white eva pods of the discovery one spaceship . chieco saw an analogy to the relationship between the spaceship and the smaller independent pods in the relationship between a personal computer and the music player . apple researched the trademark and found that it was already in use . joseph n. grasso of new jersey had originally listed an " ipod " trademark with the u.s. patent and trademark office ( uspto ) in july 2000 for internet kiosks . the first ipod kiosks had been demonstrated to the public in new jersey in march 1998 , and commercial use began in january 2000 , but had apparently been discontinued by 2001 . the trademark was registered by the uspto in november 2003 , and grasso assigned it to apple computer , inc. in 2005 .
new york city has a high degree of income disparity as indicated by its gini coefficient of 0.5 for the city overall and 0.6 for manhattan . the disparity is driven by wage growth in high-income brackets , while wages have stagnated for middle and lower-income brackets . in the first quarter of 2014 , the average weekly wage in new york county ( manhattan ) was $ 2,749 , representing the highest total among large counties in the united states . in 2013 , new york city had the highest number of billionaires of any city in the world , higher than the next five u.s. cities combined , including former mayor michael r. bloomberg . new york also had the highest density of millionaires per capita among major u.s. cities in 2014 , at 4.6 % of residents . lower manhattan has been experiencing a baby boom , with the area south of canal street witnessing 1,086 births in 2010 , 12 % greater than 2009 and over twice the number born in 2001 .
there is no cure for asthma . symptoms can be prevented by avoiding triggers , such as allergens and irritants , and by the use of inhaled corticosteroids . long-acting beta agonists ( laba ) or antileukotriene agents may be used in addition to inhaled corticosteroids if asthma symptoms remain uncontrolled . treatment of rapidly worsening symptoms is usually with an inhaled short-acting beta-2 agonist such as salbutamol and corticosteroids taken by mouth . in very severe cases , intravenous corticosteroids , magnesium sulfate , and hospitalization may be required .
the unemployment rate reached its peak of 20 % in 2005 . since then , it has decreased to 7 % in 2013 , which is only slightly above the national average . the decrease is caused on the one hand by the emergence of new jobs and on the other by a marked decrease in the working-age population , caused by emigration and low birth rates for decades . the wages in thuringia are low compared to rich bordering lands like hesse and bavaria . therefore , many thuringians are working in other german lands and even in austria and switzerland as weekly commuters . nevertheless , the demographic transition in thuringia leads to a lack of workers in some sectors . external immigration into thuringia has been encouraged by the government since about 2010 to counter this problem .
the monreale mosaics constitute the largest decoration of this kind in italy , covering 0,75 hectares with at least 100 million glass and stone tesserae . this huge work was executed between 1176 and 1186 by the order of king william ii of sicily . the iconography of the mosaics in the presbytery is similar to cefalu while the pictures in the nave are almost the same as the narrative scenes in the cappella palatina . the martorana mosaic of roger ii blessed by christ was repeated with the figure of king william ii instead of his predecessor . another panel shows the king offering the model of the cathedral to the theotokos .
the national autonomous university of mexico ( unam ) , located in mexico city , is the largest university on the continent , with more than 300,000 students from all backgrounds . three nobel laureates , several mexican entrepreneurs and most of mexico 's modern-day presidents are among its former students . unam conducts 50 % of mexico 's scientific research and has presence all across the country with satellite campuses , observatories and research centres . unam ranked 74th in the top 200 world university ranking published by times higher education ( then called times higher education supplement ) in 2006 , making it the highest ranked spanish-speaking university in the world . the sprawling main campus of the university , known as ciudad universitaria , was named a world heritage site by unesco in 2007 .
the word " emotion " dates back to 1579 , when it was adapted from the french word emouvoir , which means " to stir up . " the term emotion was introduced into academic discussion to replace passion . according to one dictionary , the earliest precursors of the word likely dates back to the very origins of language . the modern word emotion is heterogeneous in some uses of the word , emotions are intense feelings that are directed at someone or something . on the other hand , emotion can be used to refer to states that are mild ( as in annoyed or content ) and to states that are not directed at anything ( as in anxiety and depression ) . one line of research thus looks at the meaning of the word emotion in everyday language and this usage is rather different from that in academic discourse . another line of research asks about languages other than english , and one interesting finding is that many languages have a similar but not identical term
in response to madero 's letter to action , pascual orozco ( a wealthy mining baron ) and chihuahua governor abraham gonzalez formed a powerful military union in the north , taking military control of several northern mexican cities with other revolutionary leaders , including pancho villa . against madero 's wishes , orozco and villa fought for and won ciudad juarez . after militias loyal to madero defeated the mexican federal army , on may 21 , 1911 , madero signed the treaty of ciudad juarez with diaz . it required that diaz abdicate his rule and be replaced by madero . insisting on a new election , madero won overwhelmingly in late 1911 , and he established a liberal democracy and received support from the united states and popular leaders such as orozco and villa . orozco eventually became disappointed with the madero 's government and led a rebellion against him . he organized his own army , called " orozquistas " - also called the colorados ( " red flaggers " ) - after madero refused to agree to social reforms calling for better working hours , pay and conditions . the rural working class , which had supported madero , now took up arms against him in support of orozco .
voiceless consonants are produced with the vocal folds open ( spread ) and not vibrating , and voiced consonants are produced when the vocal folds are fractionally closed and vibrating ( modal voice ) . voiceless aspiration occurs when the vocal cords remain open after a consonant is released . an easy way to measure this is by noting the consonant 's voice-onset time , as the voicing of a following vowel cannot begin until the vocal cords close .
during the war , the seven nations of canada were allied with the french . these were native americans of the laurentian valley - the algonquin , the abenaki , the huron , and others . although the algonquin tribes and the seven nations were not directly concerned with the fate of the ohio river valley , they had been victims of the iroquois confederation . the iroquois had encroached on algonquin territory and pushed the algonquins west beyond lake michigan . therefore , the algonquin and the seven nations were interested in fighting against the iroquois . throughout new england , new york , and the north-west native american tribes formed differing alliances with the major belligerents . the iroquois , dominant in what is now upstate new york , sided with the british but did not play a large role in the war .
most former british colonies and protectorates are among the 53 member states of the commonwealth of nations , a non-political , voluntary association of equal members , comprising a population of around 2.2 billion people . sixteen commonwealth realms voluntarily continue to share the british monarch , queen elizabeth ii , as their head of state . these sixteen nations are distinct and equal legal entities - the united kingdom , australia , canada , new zealand , papua new guinea , antigua and barbuda , the bahamas , barbados , belize , grenada , jamaica , saint kitts and nevis , saint lucia , saint vincent and the grenadines , solomon islands and tuvalu .
antennas more complex than the dipole or vertical designs are usually intended to increase the directivity and consequently the gain of the antenna . this can be accomplished in many different ways leading to a plethora of antenna designs . the vast majority of designs are fed with a balanced line ( unlike a monopole antenna ) and are based on the dipole antenna with additional components ( or elements ) which increase its directionality . antenna " gain " in this instance describes the concentration of radiated power into a particular solid angle of space , as opposed to the spherically uniform radiation of the ideal radiator . the increased power in the desired direction is at the expense of that in the undesired directions . power is conserved , and there is no net power increase over that delivered from the power source ( the transmitter . )
the alps are a classic example of what happens when a temperate area at lower altitude gives way to higher-elevation terrain . elevations around the world that have cold climates similar to those of the polar regions have been called alpine . a rise from sea level into the upper regions of the atmosphere causes the temperature to decrease ( see adiabatic lapse rate ) . the effect of mountain chains on prevailing winds is to carry warm air belonging to the lower region into an upper zone , where it expands in volume at the cost of a proportionate loss of temperature , often accompanied by precipitation in the form of snow or rain . the height of the alps is sufficient to divide the weather patterns in europe into a wet north and a dry south because moisture is sucked from the air as it flows over the high peaks .
lasers emitting in the green part of the spectrum are widely available to the general public in a wide range of output powers . green laser pointers outputting at 532 nm ( 563.5 thz ) are relatively inexpensive compared to other wavelengths of the same power , and are very popular due to their good beam quality and very high apparent brightness . the most common green lasers use diode pumped solid state ( dpss ) technology to create the green light . an infrared laser diode at 808 nm is used to pump a crystal of neodymium-doped yttrium vanadium oxide ( nd : yvo4 ) or neodymium-doped yttrium aluminium garnet ( nd : yag ) and induces it to emit 281.76 thz ( 1064 nm ) . this deeper infrared light is then passed through another crystal containing potassium , titanium and phosphorus ( ktp ) , whose non-linear properties generate light at a frequency that is twice that of the incident beam ( 563.5 thz ) ; in this case corresponding to the wavelength of 532 nm ( " green " ) . other green wavelengths are also available using dpss technology ranging from 501 nm to 543 nm . green wavelengths are also available from gas lasers , including the helium-neon laser ( 543 nm ) , the argon-ion laser ( 514 nm ) and the krypton-ion laser ( 521 nm and 531 nm ) , as well as liquid dye lasers . green lasers have a wide variety of applications , including pointing , illumination , surgery , laser light shows , spectroscopy , interferometry , fluorescence , holography , machine vision , non-lethal weapons and bird control .
the nes uses a custom-made picture processing unit ( ppu ) developed by ricoh . all variations of the ppu feature 2 kb of video ram , 256 bytes of on-die " object attribute memory " ( oam ) to store the positions , colors , and tile indices of up to 64 sprites on the screen , and 28 bytes of on-die palette ram to allow selection of background and sprite colors . the console 's 2 kb of onboard ram may be used for tile maps and attributes on the nes board and 8 kb of tile pattern rom or ram may be included on a cartridge . the system has an available color palette of 48 colors and 6 grays . up to 25 simultaneous colors may be used without writing new values mid-frame : a background color , four sets of three tile colors and four sets of three sprite colors . the nes palette is based on ntsc rather than rgb values . a total of 64 sprites may be displayed onscreen at a given time without reloading sprites mid-screen . the standard display resolution of the nes is 256 horizontal pixels by 240 vertical pixels .
separation of powers is a political doctrine originating in the writings of montesquieu in the spirit of the laws where he urged for a constitutional government with three separate branches of government . each of the three branches would have defined abilities to check the powers of the other branches . this idea was called separation of powers . this philosophy heavily influenced the writing of the united states constitution , according to which the legislative , executive , and judicial branches of the united states government are kept distinct in order to prevent abuse of power . this united states form of separation of powers is associated with a system of checks and balances .
vladimir 's choice of eastern christianity may also have reflected his close personal ties with constantinople , which dominated the black sea and hence trade on kiev 's most vital commercial route , the dnieper river . adherence to the eastern church had long-range political , cultural , and religious consequences . the church had a liturgy written in cyrillic and a corpus of translations from greek that had been produced for the slavic peoples . this literature facilitated the conversion to christianity of the eastern slavs and introduced them to rudimentary greek philosophy , science , and historiography without the necessity of learning greek ( there were some merchants who did business with greeks and likely had an understanding of contemporary business greek ) . in contrast , educated people in medieval western and central europe learned latin . enjoying independence from the roman authority and free from tenets of latin learning , the east slavs developed their own literature and fine arts , quite distinct from those of other eastern orthodox countries .

the medieval city is a foundation of the zahringer ruling family , which rose to power in upper burgundy in the 12th century . according to 14th century historiography ( cronica de berno , 1309 ) , bern was founded in 1191 by berthold v , duke of zahringen .
from at least the late nineteenth century in europe , there was speculation that the range of human sexual response looked more like a continuum than two or three discrete categories . berlin sexologist magnus hirschfeld published a scheme in 1896 that measured the strength of an individual 's sexual desire on two independent 10-point scales , a ( homosexual ) and b ( heterosexual ) . a heterosexual individual may be a0 , b5 ; a homosexual individual may be a5 , b0 ; an asexual would be a0 , b0 ; and someone with an intense attraction to both sexes would be a9 , b9 .
in february 1853 , the british government of lord aberdeen , the prime minister , re-appointed stratford canning as british ambassador to the ottoman empire . : 110 having resigned the ambassadorship in january , he had been replaced by colonel rose as charge d 'affaires . lord stratford then turned around and sailed back to constantinople , arriving there on 5 april 1853 . there he convinced the sultan to reject the russian treaty proposal , as compromising the independence of the turks . the leader of the opposition in the british house of commons , benjamin disraeli , blamed aberdeen and stratford 's actions for making war inevitable , thus starting the process which would eventually force the aberdeen government to resign in january 1855 , over the war .
as the 1990s dawned , gamers predicted that competition from technologically superior systems such as the 16-bit sega mega drive / genesis would mean the immediate end of the nes 's dominance . instead , during the first year of nintendo 's successor console the super famicom ( named super nintendo entertainment system outside japan ) , the famicom remained the second highest-selling video game console in japan , outselling the newer and more powerful nec pc engine and sega mega drive by a wide margin . the console remained popular in japan and north america until late 1993 , when the demand for new nes software abruptly plummeted . the final famicom game released in japan is takahashi meijin no boken jima iv ( adventure island iv ) , while in north america , wario 's woods is the final licensed game . in the wake of ever decreasing sales and the lack of new software titles , nintendo of america officially discontinued the nes by 1995 . however , nintendo kept producing new famicom units in japan until september 25 , 2003 , and continued to repair famicom consoles until october 31 , 2007 , attributing the discontinuation of support to insufficient supplies of parts .
other widely used alloys that contain zinc include nickel silver , typewriter metal , soft and aluminium solder , and commercial bronze . zinc is also used in contemporary pipe organs as a substitute for the traditional lead / tin alloy in pipes . alloys of 85-88 % zinc , 4-10 % copper , and 2-8 % aluminium find limited use in certain types of machine bearings . zinc is the primary metal used in making american one cent coins since 1982 . the zinc core is coated with a thin layer of copper to give the impression of a copper coin . in 1994 , 33,200 tonnes ( 36,600 short tons ) of zinc were used to produce 13.6 billion pennies in the united states .

many sports popular today were formalised by british public schools and universities in the 19th century . these schools produced the civil servants and military and naval officers required to build and maintain the british empire , and team sports were considered a vital tool for training their students to think and act as part of a team . former public schoolboys continued to pursue these activities , and founded organisations such as the football association ( fa ) . today 's association of football with the working classes began in 1885 when the fa changed its rules to allow professional players .
factories and mines were not the only places where child labour was prevalent in the early 20th century . home-based manufacturing across the united states and europe employed children as well . governments and reformers argued that labour in factories must be regulated and the state had an obligation to provide welfare for poor . legislation that followed had the effect of moving work out of factories into urban homes . families and women , in particular , preferred it because it allowed them to generate income while taking care of household duties .
birds that employ many strategies to obtain food or feed on a variety of food items are called generalists , while others that concentrate time and effort on specific food items or have a single strategy to obtain food are considered specialists . birds ' feeding strategies vary by species . many birds glean for insects , invertebrates , fruit , or seeds . some hunt insects by suddenly attacking from a branch . those species that seek pest insects are considered beneficial ' biological control agents ' and their presence encouraged in biological pest control programs . nectar feeders such as hummingbirds , sunbirds , lories , and lorikeets amongst others have specially adapted brushy tongues and in many cases bills designed to fit co-adapted flowers . kiwis and shorebirds with long bills probe for invertebrates ; shorebirds ' varied bill lengths and feeding methods result in the separation of ecological niches . loons , diving ducks , penguins and auks pursue their prey underwater , using their wings or feet for propulsion , while aerial predators such as sulids , kingfishers and terns plunge dive after their prey . flamingos , three species of prion , and some ducks are filter feeders . geese and dabbling ducks are primarily grazers .
on 1 september , germany invaded poland from the west . within the first few days of the invasion , germany began conducting massacres of polish and jewish civilians and pows . these executions took place in over 30 towns and villages in the first month of german occupation . the luftwaffe also took part by strafing fleeing civilian refugees on roads and carrying out a bombing campaign . the soviet union assisted german air forces by allowing them to use signals broadcast by the soviet radio station at minsk allegedly " for urgent aeronautical experiments . "
in may 2005 , carrie underwood was announced the winner , with bice the runner-up . both underwood and bice released the coronation song " inside your heaven . " underwood has since sold 65 million records worldwide , and become the most successful idol contestant in the u.s. , selling over 14 million albums copies in the u.s. and has more underwood has won seven grammy awards , the most grammys by an " american idol " alumnus .
in june 1990 , the times ceased its policy of using courtesy titles ( " mr , " " mrs , " or " miss " prefixes ) for living persons before full names on first reference , but it continues to use them before surnames on subsequent references . the more formal style is now confined to the " court and social " page , though " ms " is now acceptable in that section , as well as before surnames in news sections .
upon being confirmed in 1966 , she adopted veronica as a confirmation name . she was raised in the detroit suburbs of pontiac and avon township ( now rochester hills ) . months before her mother died of breast cancer , madonna noticed changes in her behavior and personality , although she did not understand the reason . her mother was at a loss to explain her medical condition , and often began to cry when madonna questioned her about it . madonna later acknowledged that she had not grasped the concept of her mother dying .
because interframe compression copies data from one frame to another , if the original frame is simply cut out ( or lost in transmission ) , the following frames cannot be reconstructed properly . some video formats , such as dv , compress each frame independently using intraframe compression . making ' cuts ' in intraframe-compressed video is almost as easy as editing uncompressed video : one finds the beginning and ending of each frame , and simply copies bit-for-bit each frame that one wants to keep , and discards the frames one doesn 't want . another difference between intraframe and interframe compression is that , with intraframe systems , each frame uses a similar amount of data . in most interframe systems , certain frames ( such as " i frames " in mpeg-2 ) aren 't allowed to copy data from other frames , so they require much more data than other frames nearby .
copper-alloy touch surfaces have natural intrinsic properties to destroy a wide range of microorganisms ( e.g. , e. coli o157 : h7 , methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus ( mrsa ) , staphylococcus , clostridium difficile , influenza a virus , adenovirus , and fungi ) . some 355 copper alloys were proven to kill more than 99.9 % of disease-causing bacteria within just two hours when cleaned regularly . the united states environmental protection agency ( epa ) has approved the registrations of these copper alloys as " antimicrobial materials with public health benefits , " which allows manufacturers to legally make claims as to the positive public health benefits of products made with registered antimicrobial copper alloys . in addition , the epa has approved a long list of antimicrobial copper products made from these alloys , such as bedrails , handrails , over-bed tables , sinks , faucets , door knobs , toilet hardware , computer keyboards , health club equipment , shopping cart handles , etc . ( for a comprehensive list of products , see : antimicrobial copper-alloy touch surfaces # approved products ) . copper doorknobs are used by hospitals to reduce the transfer of disease , and legionnaires ' disease is suppressed by copper tubing in plumbing systems . antimicrobial copper alloy products are now being installed in healthcare facilities in the u.k. , ireland , japan , korea , france , denmark , and brazil [ citation needed ] and in the subway transit system in santiago , chile , where copper-zinc alloy handrails will be installed in some 30 stations between 2011-2014 .

presbyterian history is part of the history of christianity , but the beginning of presbyterianism as a distinct movement occurred during the 16th-century protestant reformation . as the catholic church resisted the reformers , several different theological movements splintered from the church and bore different denominations . presbyterianism was especially influenced by the french theologian john calvin , who is credited with the development of reformed theology , and the work of john knox , a scotsman who studied with calvin in geneva , switzerland and brought his teachings back to scotland . the presbyterian church traces its ancestry back primarily to england and scotland . in august 1560 the parliament of scotland adopted the scots confession as the creed of the scottish kingdom . in december 1560 , the first book of discipline was published , outlining important doctrinal issues but also establishing regulations for church government , including the creation of ten ecclesiastical districts with appointed superintendents which later became known as presbyteries .
the red lion in parliament square is close to the palace of westminster and is consequently used by political journalists and members of parliament . the pub is equipped with a division bell that summons mps back to the chamber when they are required to take part in a vote . the punch bowl , mayfair was at one time jointly owned by madonna and guy ritchie . the coleherne public house in earls court was a well-known gay pub from the 1950s . it attracted many well-known patrons , such as freddie mercury , kenny everett and rudolph nureyev . it was used by the serial-killer colin ireland to pick up victims .
major european rivers flow from switzerland , such as the rhine , the rhone , the inn , the ticino and the po , all of which have headwaters in the alps and flow into neighbouring countries , finally emptying into the north sea , the mediterranean sea , the adriatic sea and the black sea . other rivers such as the danube have major tributaries flowing into them that originate in the alps . the rhone is second to the nile as a freshwater source to the mediterranean sea ; the river begins as glacial meltwater , flows into lake geneva , and from there to france where one of its uses is to cool nuclear power plants . the rhine originates in a 30 square kilometre area in switzerland and represents almost 60 percent of water exported from the country . tributary valleys , some of which are complicated , channel water to the main valleys which can experience flooding during the snow melt season when rapid runoff causes debris torrents and swollen rivers .
after the revolution of 1979 , as the new government imposed new laws and standards , a new age in iranian cinema emerged , starting with viva ... by khosrow sinai and followed by many other directors , such as abbas kiarostami and jafar panahi . kiarostami , an admired iranian director , planted iran firmly on the map of world cinema when he won the palme d 'or for taste of cherry in 1997 . the continuous presence of iranian films in prestigious international festivals , such as the cannes film festival , the venice film festival , and the berlin international film festival , attracted world attention to iranian masterpieces . in 2006 , six iranian films , of six different styles , represented iranian cinema at the berlin international film festival . critics considered this a remarkable event in the history of iranian cinema .
the qur 'an relates detailed narrative accounts of maryam ( mary ) in two places , qur 'an 3 : 35-47 and 19 : 16-34 . these state beliefs in both the immaculate conception of mary and the virgin birth of jesus . the account given in sura 19 is nearly identical with that in the gospel according to luke , and both of these ( luke , sura 19 ) begin with an account of the visitation of an angel upon zakariya ( zecharias ) and good news of the birth of yahya ( john ) , followed by the account of the annunciation . it mentions how mary was informed by an angel that she would become the mother of jesus through the actions of god alone .
in the laboratory , bacteria are usually grown using solid or liquid media . solid growth media , such as agar plates , are used to isolate pure cultures of a bacterial strain . however , liquid growth media are used when measurement of growth or large volumes of cells are required . growth in stirred liquid media occurs as an even cell suspension , making the cultures easy to divide and transfer , although isolating single bacteria from liquid media is difficult . the use of selective media ( media with specific nutrients added or deficient , or with antibiotics added ) can help identify specific organisms .
film speed is used in the exposure equations to find the appropriate exposure parameters . four variables are available to the photographer to obtain the desired effect : lighting , film speed , f-number ( aperture size ) , and shutter speed ( exposure time ) . the equation may be expressed as ratios , or , by taking the logarithm ( base 2 ) of both sides , by addition , using the apex system , in which every increment of 1 is a doubling of exposure ; this increment is commonly known as a " stop . " the effective f-number is proportional to the ratio between the lens focal length and aperture diameter , the diameter itself being proportional to the square root of the aperture area . thus , a lens set to f / 1.4 allows twice as much light to strike the focal plane as a lens set to f / 2 . therefore , each f-number factor of the square root of two ( approximately 1.4 ) is also a stop , so lenses are typically marked in that progression : f / 1.4 , 2 , 2.8 , 4 , 5.6 , 8 , 11 , 16 , 22 , 32 , etc .
desktop computers and laptops are commonly infected with malware either to gather passwords or financial account information , or to construct a botnet to attack another target . smart phones , tablet computers , smart watches , and other mobile devices such as quantified self devices like activity trackers have also become targets and many of these have sensors such as cameras , microphones , gps receivers , compasses , and accelerometers which could be exploited , and may collect personal information , including sensitive health information . wifi , bluetooth , and cell phone network on any of these devices could be used as attack vectors , and sensors might be remotely activated after a successful breach .
beginning as a self-help program in the mid-1960s , the cotton research and promotion program ( crpp ) was organized by u.s. cotton producers in response to cotton 's steady decline in market share . at that time , producers voted to set up a per-bale assessment system to fund the program , with built-in safeguards to protect their investments . with the passage of the cotton research and promotion act of 1966 , the program joined forces and began battling synthetic competitors and re-establishing markets for cotton . today , the success of this program has made cotton the best-selling fiber in the u.s. and one of the best-selling fibers in the world .

the bronx / ˈbrɒŋks / is the northernmost of the five boroughs ( counties ) of new york city in the state of new york , located south of westchester county . many bridges and tunnels link the bronx to the island and borough of manhattan to the west over and under the narrow harlem river , as well as three longer bridges south over the east river to the borough of queens . of the five boroughs , the bronx is the only one on the u.s. mainland and , with a land area of 42 square miles ( 109 km2 ) and a population of 1,438,159 in 2014 , has the fourth largest land area , the fourth highest population , and the third-highest population density .
a reward will be paid to any person who furnishes information which leads to an arrest , conviction , or revocation of a license , so long as they are not a local , state , or federal employee in the performance of official duties . the secretary may also provide reasonable and necessary costs incurred for the care of fish , wildlife , and forest service or plant pending the violation caused by the criminal . if the balance ever exceeds $ 500,000 the secretary of the treasury is required to deposit an amount equal to the excess into the cooperative endangered species conservation fund .
after the costly u.s. involvement in world war i , isolationism grew within the nation . congress refused membership in the league of nations , and in response to the growing turmoil in europe and asia , the gradually more restrictive neutrality acts were passed , which were intended to prevent the u.s. from supporting either side in a war . president franklin d. roosevelt sought to support britain , however , and in 1940 signed the lend-lease act , which permitted an expansion of the " cash and carry " arms trade to develop with britain , which controlled the atlantic sea lanes .
this constitution was created when the u.s. congress directed local government to organize a constitutional convention to write the puerto rico constitution in 1951 . the acceptance of that constitution by puerto rico 's electorate , the u.s. congress , and the u.s. president occurred in 1952 . in addition , the rights , privileges and immunities attendant to united states citizens are " respected in puerto rico to the same extent as though puerto rico were a state of the union " through the express extension of the privileges and immunities clause of the u.s. constitution by the u.s. congress in 1948 .
in the treaty of paris after the revolution , the british had ceded the lands between the appalachian mountains and the mississippi river to the united states , without consulting the shawnee , cherokee , choctaw and other smaller tribes who lived there . because many of the tribes had fought as allies of the british , the united states compelled tribal leaders to sign away lands in postwar treaties , and began dividing these lands for settlement . this provoked a war in the northwest territory in which the u.s. forces performed poorly ; the battle of the wabash in 1791 was the most severe defeat ever suffered by the united states at the hands of american indians . president washington dispatched a newly trained army to the region , which decisively defeated the indian confederacy at the battle of fallen timbers in 1794 .
in the early and mid-2000s , the bush administration called numerous times for investigation into the safety and soundness of the gses and their swelling portfolio of subprime mortgages . on september 10 , 2003 , the house financial services committee held a hearing at the urging of the administration to assess safety and soundness issues and to review a recent report by the office of federal housing enterprise oversight ( ofheo ) that had uncovered accounting discrepancies within the two entities . the hearings never resulted in new legislation or formal investigation of fannie mae and freddie mac , as many of the committee members refused to accept the report and instead rebuked ofheo for their attempt at regulation . some believe this was an early warning to the systemic risk that the growing market in subprime mortgages posed to the u.s. financial system that went unheeded .
a pm motor does not have a field winding on the stator frame , instead relying on pms to provide the magnetic field against which the rotor field interacts to produce torque . compensating windings in series with the armature may be used on large motors to improve commutation under load . because this field is fixed , it cannot be adjusted for speed control . pm fields ( stators ) are convenient in miniature motors to eliminate the power consumption of the field winding . most larger dc motors are of the " dynamo " type , which have stator windings . historically , pms could not be made to retain high flux if they were disassembled ; field windings were more practical to obtain the needed amount of flux . however , large pms are costly , as well as dangerous and difficult to assemble ; this favors wound fields for large machines .
in 2012 the paris agglomeration ( urban area ) counted 28,800 people without a fixed residence , an increase of 84 percent since 2001 ; it represents 43 percent of the homeless in all of france . forty-one percent were women , and 29 percent were accompanied by children . fifty-six percent of the homeless were born outside france , the largest number coming from africa and eastern europe . the city of paris has sixty homeless shelters , called centres d 'hebergement et de reinsertion sociale or chrs , which are funded by the city and operated by private charities and associations .
the partyja bpf ( belarusian popular front ) was established in 1988 as a political party and cultural movement for democracy and independence , a la the baltic republics ' popular fronts . the discovery of mass graves in kurapaty outside minsk by historian zianon pazniak , the belarusian popular front 's first leader , gave additional momentum to the pro-democracy and pro-independence movement in belarus . it claimed that the nkvd performed secret killings in kurapaty . initially the front had significant visibility because its numerous public actions almost always ended in clashes with the police and the kgb .
there were serious scientific objections to the process of natural selection as the key mechanism of evolution , including karl von nageli 's insistence that a trivial characteristic with no adaptive advantage could not be developed by selection . darwin conceded that these could be linked to adaptive characteristics . his estimate that the age of the earth allowed gradual evolution was disputed by william thomson ( later awarded the title lord kelvin ) , who calculated that it had cooled in less than 100 million years . darwin accepted blending inheritance , but fleeming jenkin calculated that as it mixed traits , natural selection could not accumulate useful traits . darwin tried to meet these objections in the 5th edition . mivart supported directed evolution , and compiled scientific and religious objections to natural selection . in response , darwin made considerable changes to the sixth edition . the problems of the age of the earth and heredity were only resolved in the 20th century .
the event of the protestant reformation and the politics that ensued has been cited as the origins of german identity that arose in response to the spread of a common german language and literature . early german national culture was developed through literary and religious figures including martin luther , johann wolfgang von goethe and friedrich schiller . the concept of a german nation was developed by german philosopher johann gottfried herder . the popularity of german identity arose in the aftermath of the french revolution .

in central and northern italy and in flanders , the rise of towns that were to a degree self-governing stimulated economic growth and created an environment for new types of trade associations . commercial cities on the shores of the baltic entered into agreements known as the hanseatic league , and the italian maritime republics such as venice , genoa , and pisa expanded their trade throughout the mediterranean . [ v ] great trading fairs were established and flourished in northern france during the period , allowing italian and german merchants to trade with each other as well as local merchants . in the late 13th century new land and sea routes to the far east were pioneered , famously described in the travels of marco polo written by one of the traders , marco polo ( d . 1324 ) . besides new trading opportunities , agricultural and technological improvements enabled an increase in crop yields , which in turn allowed the trade networks to expand . rising trade brought new methods of dealing with money , and gold coinage was again minted in europe , first in italy and later in france and other countries . new forms of commercial contracts emerged , allowing risk to be shared among merchants . accounting methods improved , partly through the use of double-entry bookkeeping ; letters of credit also appeared , allowing easy transmission of money .
burgh ( 2006 ) , suggests that the roots of western classical music ultimately lie in ancient egyptian art music via cheironomy and the ancient egyptian orchestra , which dates to 2695 bc . this was followed by early christian liturgical music , which itself dates back to the ancient greeks [ citation needed ] . the development of individual tones and scales was made by ancient greeks such as aristoxenus and pythagoras . pythagoras created a tuning system and helped to codify musical notation . ancient greek instruments such as the aulos ( a reed instrument ) and the lyre ( a stringed instrument similar to a small harp ) eventually led to the modern-day instruments of a classical orchestra . the antecedent to the early period was the era of ancient music before the fall of the roman empire ( 476 ad ) . very little music survives from this time , most of it from ancient greece .
statistically speaking , cable-borne elevators are extremely safe . their safety record is unsurpassed by any other vehicle system . in 1998 , it was estimated that approximately eight millionths of one percent ( 1 in 12 million ) of elevator rides result in an anomaly , and the vast majority of these were minor things such as the doors failing to open . of the 20 to 30 elevator-related deaths each year , most of them are maintenance-related - for example , technicians leaning too far into the shaft or getting caught between moving parts , and most of the rest are attributed to other kinds of accidents , such as people stepping blindly through doors that open into empty shafts or being strangled by scarves caught in the doors . in fact , prior to the september 11th terrorist attacks , the only known free-fall incident in a modern cable-borne elevator happened in 1945 when a b-25 bomber struck the empire state building in fog , severing the cables of an elevator cab , which fell from the 75th floor all the way to the bottom of the building , seriously injuring ( though not killing ) the sole occupant - the elevator operator . however , there was an incident in 2007 at a seattle children 's hospital , where a thyssenkrupp isis machine-room-less elevator free-fell until the safety brakes were engaged . this was due to a flaw in the design where the cables were connected at one common point , and the kevlar ropes had a tendency to overheat and cause slipping ( or , in this case , a free-fall ) . while it is possible ( though extraordinarily unlikely ) for an elevator 's cable to snap , all elevators in the modern era have been fitted with several safety devices which prevent the elevator from simply free-falling and crashing . an elevator cab is typically borne by 2 to 6 ( up to 12 or more in high rise installations ) hoist cables or belts , each of which is capable on its own of supporting the full load of the elevator plus twenty-five percent more weight . in addition , there is a device which detects whether the elevator is descending faster than its maximum designed speed ; if this happens , the device causes copper ( or silicon nitride in high rise installations ) brake shoes to clamp down along the vertical rails in the shaft , stopping the elevator quickly , but not so abruptly as to cause injury . this device is called the governor , and was invented by elisha graves otis . in addition , a oil / hydraulic or spring or polyurethane or telescopic oil / hydraulic buffer or a combination ( depending on the travel height and travel speed ) is installed at the bottom of the shaft ( or in the bottom of the cab and sometimes also in the top of the cab or shaft ) to somewhat cushion any impact . however , in thailand , in november 2012 , a woman was killed in free falling elevator , in what was reported as the " first legally recognised death caused by a falling lift . "
in 1824 the british government instructed the governor of new south wales thomas brisbane to occupy norfolk island as a place to send " the worst description of convicts . " its remoteness , previously seen as a disadvantage , was now viewed as an asset for the detention of recalcitrant male prisoners . the convicts detained have long been assumed to be a hardcore of recidivists , or ' doubly-convicted capital respites ' - that is , men transported to australia who committed fresh colonial crimes for which they were sentenced to death , and were spared the gallows on condition of life at norfolk island . however , a recent study has demonstrated , utilising a database of 6,458 norfolk island convicts , that the reality was somewhat different : more than half were detained at norfolk island without ever receiving a colonial conviction , and only 15 % had been reprieved from a death sentence . furthermore , the overwhelming majority of convicts sent to norfolk island had committed non-violent property sentences , and the average length of detention was three years .
the northern russian dialects and those spoken along the volga river typically pronounce unstressed / o / clearly ( the phenomenon called okanye / оканье ) . besides the absence of vowel reduction , some dialects have high or diphthongal / e ~ i  ɛ / in the place of proto-slavic * e and / o ~ u  ɔ / in stressed closed syllables ( as in ukrainian ) instead of standard russian / e / and / o / . an interesting morphological feature is a post-posed definite article -to , -ta , -te similarly to that existing in bulgarian and macedonian .
over 90 weeklies , fortnightlies and quarterlies are published in sanskrit . sudharma , a daily newspaper in sanskrit , has been published out of mysore , india , since 1970 , while sanskrit vartman patram and vishwasya vrittantam started in gujarat during the last five years . since 1974 , there has been a short daily news broadcast on state-run all india radio . these broadcasts are also made available on the internet on air 's website . sanskrit news is broadcast on tv and on the internet through the dd national channel at 6 : 55 am ist .
while short-term memory encodes information acoustically , long-term memory encodes it semantically : baddeley ( 1966 ) discovered that , after 20 minutes , test subjects had the most difficulty recalling a collection of words that had similar meanings ( e.g. big , large , great , huge ) long-term . another part of long-term memory is episodic memory , " which attempts to capture information such as ' what ' , ' when ' and ' where ' . " with episodic memory , individuals are able to recall specific events such as birthday parties and weddings .
medical facilities in mali are very limited , and medicines are in short supply . malaria and other arthropod-borne diseases are prevalent in mali , as are a number of infectious diseases such as cholera and tuberculosis . mali 's population also suffers from a high rate of child malnutrition and a low rate of immunization . an estimated 1.9 percent of the adult and children population was afflicted with hiv / aids that year , among the lowest rates in sub-saharan africa . an estimated 85-91 percent of mali 's girls and women have had female genital mutilation ( 2006 and 2001 data ) .
after the early 20th century revolutions , shifting alliances of china 's regional warlords waged war for control of the beijing government . despite the fact that various warlords gained control of the government in beijing during the warlord era , this did not constitute a new era of control or governance , because other warlords did not acknowledge the transitory governments in this period and were a law unto themselves . these military-dominated governments were collectively known as the beiyang government . the warlord era ended around 1927 .
san diego hosts several major producers of wireless cellular technology . qualcomm was founded and is headquartered in san diego , and is one of the largest private-sector employers in san diego . other wireless industry manufacturers headquartered here include nokia , lg electronics , kyocera international . , cricket communications and novatel wireless . the largest software company in san diego is security software company websense inc . san diego also has the u.s. headquarters for the slovakian security company eset . san diego has been designated as an ihub innovation center for collaboration potentially between wireless and life sciences .
a major concern of hegel 's phenomenology of spirit ( 1807 ) and of the philosophy of spirit that he lays out in his encyclopedia of the philosophical sciences ( 1817-1830 ) is the interrelation between individual humans , which he conceives in terms of " mutual recognition . " however , what climacus means by the aforementioned statement , is that hegel , in the philosophy of right , believed the best solution was to surrender one 's individuality to the customs of the state , identifying right and wrong in view of the prevailing bourgeois morality . individual human will ought , at the state 's highest level of development , to properly coincide with the will of the state . climacus rejects hegel 's suppression of individuality by pointing out it is impossible to create a valid set of rules or system in any society which can adequately describe existence for any one individual . submitting one 's will to the state denies personal freedom , choice , and responsibility .
following the ulm campaign , french forces managed to capture vienna in november . the fall of vienna provided the french a huge bounty as they captured 100,000 muskets , 500 cannons , and the intact bridges across the danube . at this critical juncture , both tsar alexander i and holy roman emperor francis ii decided to engage napoleon in battle , despite reservations from some of their subordinates . napoleon sent his army north in pursuit of the allies , but then ordered his forces to retreat so that he could feign a grave weakness . desperate to lure the allies into battle , napoleon gave every indication in the days preceding the engagement that the french army was in a pitiful state , even abandoning the dominant pratzen heights near the village of austerlitz . at the battle of austerlitz , in moravia on 2 december , he deployed the french army below the pratzen heights and deliberately weakened his right flank , enticing the allies to launch a major assault there in the hopes of rolling up the whole french line . a forced march from vienna by marshal davout and his iii corps plugged the gap left by napoleon just in time . meanwhile , the heavy allied deployment against the french right weakened their center on the pratzen heights , which was viciously attacked by the iv corps of marshal soult . with the allied center demolished , the french swept through both enemy flanks and sent the allies fleeing chaotically , capturing thousands of prisoners in the process . the battle is often seen as a tactical masterpiece because of the near-perfect execution of a calibrated but dangerous plan - of the same stature as cannae , the celebrated triumph by hannibal some 2000 years before .
the oak forests of the southern and central appalachians consist largely of black , northern red , white , chestnut and scarlet oaks ( quercus velutina , q. rubra , q. alba , q. prinus and q. coccinea ) and hickories , such as the pignut ( carya glabra ) in particular . the richest forests , which grade into mesic types , usually in coves and on gentle slopes , have dominantly white and northern red oaks , while the driest sites are dominated by chestnut oak , or sometimes by scarlet or northern red oaks . in the northern appalachians the oaks , except for white and northern red , drop out , while the latter extends farthest north .
in the united states , macabre-rock pioneer alice cooper achieved mainstream success with the top ten album school 's out ( 1972 ) . in the following year blues rockers zz top released their classic album tres hombres and aerosmith produced their eponymous debut , as did southern rockers lynyrd skynyrd and proto-punk outfit new york dolls , demonstrating the diverse directions being pursued in the genre . montrose , including the instrumental talent of ronnie montrose and vocals of sammy hagar and arguably the first all american hard rock band to challenge the british dominance of the genre , released their first album in 1973 . kiss built on the theatrics of alice cooper and the look of the new york dolls to produce a unique band persona , achieving their commercial breakthrough with the double live album alive ! in 1975 and helping to take hard rock into the stadium rock era . in the mid-1970s aerosmith achieved their commercial and artistic breakthrough with toys in the attic ( 1975 ) , which reached number 11 in the american album chart , and rocks ( 1976 ) , which peaked at number three . blue oyster cult , formed in the late 60s , picked up on some of the elements introduced by black sabbath with their breakthrough live gold album on your feet or on your knees ( 1975 ) , followed by their first platinum album , agents of fortune ( 1976 ) , containing the hit single " ( don 't fear ) the reaper , " which reached number 12 on the billboard charts . journey released their eponymous debut in 1975 and the next year boston released their highly successful debut album . in the same year , hard rock bands featuring women saw commercial success as heart released dreamboat annie and the runaways debuted with their self-titled album . while heart had a more folk-oriented hard rock sound , the runaways leaned more towards a mix of punk-influenced music and hard rock . the amboy dukes , having emerged from the detroit garage rock scene and most famous for their top 20 psychedelic hit " journey to the center of the mind " ( 1968 ) , were dissolved by their guitarist ted nugent , who embarked on a solo career that resulted in four successive multi-platinum albums between ted nugent ( 1975 ) and his best selling double live gonzo ( 1978 ) .
although the majority of journeys involving central london are made by public transport , car travel is common in the suburbs . the inner ring road ( around the city centre ) , the north and south circular roads ( in the suburbs ) , and the outer orbital motorway ( the m25 , outside the built-up area ) encircle the city and are intersected by a number of busy radial routes - but very few motorways penetrate into inner london . a plan for a comprehensive network of motorways throughout the city ( the ringways plan ) was prepared in the 1960s but was mostly cancelled in the early 1970s . the m25 is the longest ring-road motorway in the world at 121.5 mi ( 195.5 km ) long . the a1 and m1 connect london to leeds , and newcastle and edinburgh .

mali faces numerous health challenges related to poverty , malnutrition , and inadequate hygiene and sanitation . mali 's health and development indicators rank among the worst in the world . life expectancy at birth is estimated to be 53.06 years in 2012 . in 2000 , 62-65 percent of the population was estimated to have access to safe drinking water and only 69 percent to sanitation services of some kind . in 2001 , the general government expenditures on health totalled about us $ 4 per capita at an average exchange rate .
over the course of the 20th century , the world 's per-capita gross domestic product grew by a factor of five , much more than all earlier centuries combined ( including the 19th with its industrial revolution ) . many economists make the case that this understates the magnitude of growth , as many of the goods and services consumed at the end of the 20th century , such as improved medicine ( causing world life expectancy to increase by more than two decades ) and communications technologies , were not available at any price at its beginning . however , the gulf between the world 's rich and poor grew wider , and the majority of the global population remained in the poor side of the divide .
kathmandu valley is described as " an enormous treasure house of art and sculptures , " which are made of wood , stone , metal , and terracotta , and found in profusion in temples , shrines , stupas , gompas , chaityasm and palaces . the art objects are also seen in street corners , lanes , private courtyards and in open ground . most art is in the form of icons of gods and goddesses . kathmandu valley has had this art treasure for a very long time , but received worldwide recognition only after the country opened to the outside world in 1950 .
the treaty of versailles prevented germany having aa weapons , and for example , the krupps designers joined bofors in sweden . some world war i guns were retained and some covert aa training started in the late 1920s . germany introduced the 8.8 cm flak 18 in 1933 , 36 and 37 models followed with various improvements but ballistic performance was unchanged . in the late 1930s the 10.5 cm flak 38 appeared soon followed by the 39 , this was designed primarily for static sites but had a mobile mounting and the unit had 220v 24 kw generators . in 1938 design started on the 12.8 cm flak .

charles peirce ( 1839-1914 ) was highly influential in laying the groundwork for today 's empirical scientific method . [ citation needed ] although peirce severely criticized many elements of descartes ' peculiar brand of rationalism , he did not reject rationalism outright . indeed , he concurred with the main ideas of rationalism , most importantly the idea that rational concepts can be meaningful and the idea that rational concepts necessarily go beyond the data given by empirical observation . in later years he even emphasized the concept-driven side of the then ongoing debate between strict empiricism and strict rationalism , in part to counterbalance the excesses to which some of his cohorts had taken pragmatism under the " data-driven " strict-empiricist view .
after working for many years at the university of chicago , arthur holly compton returned to st. louis in 1946 to serve as washington university 's ninth chancellor . compton reestablished the washington university football team , making the declaration that athletics were to be henceforth played on a " strictly amateur " basis with no athletic scholarships . under compton 's leadership , enrollment at the university grew dramatically , fueled primarily by world war ii veterans ' use of their gi bill benefits .
south america became linked to north america through the isthmus of panama during the pliocene , bringing a nearly complete end to south america 's distinctive marsupial faunas . the formation of the isthmus had major consequences on global temperatures , since warm equatorial ocean currents were cut off and an atlantic cooling cycle began , with cold arctic and antarctic waters dropping temperatures in the now-isolated atlantic ocean . africa 's collision with europe formed the mediterranean sea , cutting off the remnants of the tethys ocean . sea level changes exposed the land-bridge between alaska and asia . near the end of the pliocene , about 2.58 million years ago ( the start of the quaternary period ) , the current ice age began . the polar regions have since undergone repeated cycles of glaciation and thaw , repeating every 40,000-100,000 years .
xalwo ( halva ) is a popular confection eaten during festive occasions , such as eid celebrations or wedding receptions . it is made from sugar , corn starch , cardamom powder , nutmeg powder and ghee . peanuts are also sometimes added to enhance texture and flavor . after meals , homes are traditionally perfumed using frankincense ( lubaan ) or incense ( cuunsi ) , which is prepared inside an incense burner referred to as a dabqaad .

my beautiful dark twisted fantasy , west 's fifth studio album , was released in november 2010 to rave reviews from critics , many of whom described it as his best work that solidified his comeback . in stark contrast to his previous effort , which featured a minimalist sound , dark fantasy adopts a maximalist philosophy and deals with themes of celebrity and excess . the record included the international hit " all of the lights , " and billboard hits " power , " " monster , " and " runaway , " the latter of which accompanied a 35-minute film of the same name . during this time , west initiated the free music program good fridays through his website , offering a free download of previously unreleased songs each friday , a portion of which were included on the album . this promotion ran from august 20 - december 17 , 2010 . dark fantasy went on to go platinum in the united states , but its omission as a contender for album of the year at the 54th grammy awards was viewed as a " snub " by several media outlets .
the government exerts greater control over broadcast media than print media , especially due to finance and licensing . the swiss broadcasting corporation , whose name was recently changed to srg ssr , is charged with the production and broadcast of radio and television programs . srg ssr studios are distributed throughout the various language regions . radio content is produced in six central and four regional studios while the television programs are produced in geneva , zurich and lugano . an extensive cable network also allows most swiss to access the programs from neighboring countries .
prior to 1917 , turkey used the lunar islamic calendar with the hegira era for general purposes and the julian calendar for fiscal purposes . the start of the fiscal year was eventually fixed at 1 march and the year number was roughly equivalent to the hegira year ( see rumi calendar ) . as the solar year is longer than the lunar year this originally entailed the use of " escape years " every so often when the number of the fiscal year would jump . from 1 march 1917 the fiscal year became gregorian , rather than julian . on 1 january 1926 the use of the gregorian calendar was extended to include use for general purposes and the number of the year became the same as in other countries .
genocide has become an official term used in international relations . the word genocide was not in use before 1944 . before this , in 1941 , winston churchill described the mass killing of russian prisoners of war and civilians as " a crime without a name . " in that year , a polish-jewish lawyer named raphael lemkin , described the policies of systematic murder founded by the nazis as genocide . the word genocide is the combination of the greek prefix geno- ( meaning tribe or race ) and caedere ( the latin word for to kill ) . the word is defined as a specific set of violent crimes that are committed against a certain group with the attempt to remove the entire group from existence or to destroy them .
by the late middle ages , great britain was separated into the kingdoms of england and scotland . power in ireland fluxed between gaelic kingdoms , hiberno-norman lords and the english-dominated lordship of ireland . a similar situation existed in the principality of wales , which was slowly being annexed into the kingdom of england by a series of laws . during the course of the 15th century , the crown of england would assert a claim to the crown of france , thereby also releasing the king of england as from being vassal of the king of france . in 1534 , king henry viii , at first having been a strong defender of roman catholicism in the face of the reformation , separated from the roman church after failing to secure a divorce from the pope . his response was to place the king of england as " the only supreme head in earth of the church of england , " thereby removing the authority of the pope from the affairs of the english church . ireland , which had been held by the king of england as lord of ireland , but which strictly speaking had been a feudal possession of the pope since the norman invasion was declared a separate kingdom in personal union with england .
criticism of the term intellectual property ranges from discussing its vagueness and abstract overreach to direct contention to the semantic validity of using words like property and rights in fashions that contradict practice and law . many detractors think this term specially serves the doctrinal agenda of parties opposing reform in the public interest or otherwise abusing related legislations ; and that it disallows intelligent discussion about specific and often unrelated aspects of copyright , patents , trademarks , etc .
on 11 october 1962 , the first session of the second vatican council was held in the vatican . he gave the gaudet mater ecclesia speech , which served as the opening address for the council . the day was basically electing members for several council commissions that would work on the issues presented in the council . on that same night following the conclusion of the first session , the people in saint peter 's square chanted and yelled with the sole objective of getting john xxiii to appear at the window to address them .

a wrestler can win by knockout ( sometimes referred to as a referee stoppage ) if they do not resort to submission holds , but stills pummels their opponent to the point that they are unconscious or are unable to intelligently defend themselves . to check for a knockout in this manner , a referee will wave their hand in front of the wrestler 's face ; if the wrestler does not react in any way , the referee will award the victory to the other wrestler . if all the active wrestlers in a match are down inside the ring at the same time , the referee will begin a count ( usually ten seconds , twenty in japan ) . if nobody rises to their feet by the end of the count , the match is ruled a draw . any participant who stands up in time will end the count for everyone else . in a last man standing match , this form of a knockout is the only way that the match can end , so the referee will count when one or more wrestlers are down , and one wrestler standing up before the 10-count doesn 't stop the count for another wrestler who is still down .
the modern era of comics in japan began after world war ii , propelled by the success of the serialized comics of the prolific osamu tezuka and the comic strip sazae-san . genres and audiences diversified over the following decades . stories are usually first serialized in magazines which are often hundreds of pages thick and may over a dozen stories ; they are later compiled in tankobon-format books . at the turn of the 20th and 21st centuries , nearly a quarter of all printed material in japan was comics. translations became extremely popular in foreign markets - in some cases equaling or surpassing the sales of domestic comics .
the " orange peel " effect on vinyl records is caused by worn molds . rather than having the proper mirror-like finish , the surface of the record will have a texture that looks like orange peel . this introduces noise into the record , particularly in the lower frequency range . with direct metal mastering ( dmm ) , the master disc is cut on a copper-coated disc , which can also have a minor " orange peel " effect on the disc itself . as this " orange peel " originates in the master rather than being introduced in the pressing stage , there is no ill effect as there is no physical distortion of the groove .
on 22 may 2015 , sun reporter anthony france was found guilty of aiding and abetting misconduct in a public office between 2008 and 2011 . france 's trial followed the london metropolitan police 's operation elveden , an ongoing investigation into alleged payments to police and officials in exchange for information . he had paid a total of more than £ 22,000 to pc timothy edwards , an anti-terrorism police officer based at heathrow airport . the police officer had already pleaded guilty to misconduct in a public office and given a two-year gaol sentence in 2014 , but the jury in france 's trial was not informed of this . following the passing of the guilty verdict , the officer leading operation elveden , detective chief superintendent gordon briggs said france and edwards had been in a " long-term , corrupt relationship . "
the style and role of any minority leader is influenced by a variety of elements , including personality and contextual factors , such as the size and cohesion of the minority party , whether his or her party controls the white house , the general political climate in the house , and the controversy that is sometimes associated with the legislative agenda . despite the variability of these factors , there are a number of institutional obligations associated with this position . many of these assignments or roles are spelled out in the house rule book . others have devolved upon the position in other ways . to be sure , the minority leader is provided with extra staff resources - beyond those accorded him or her as a representative - to assist in carrying out diverse leadership functions . worth emphasis is that there are limits on the institutional role of the minority leader , because the majority party exercises disproportionate influence over the agenda , partisan ratios on committees , staff resources , administrative operations , and the day-to-day schedule and management of floor activities .
in the fall of 1958 , nasser formed a tripartite committee consisting of zakaria mohieddin , al-hawrani , and salah bitar to oversee developments in syria . by moving the latter two , who were ba 'athists , to cairo , he neutralized important political figures who had their own ideas about how syria should be run . he put syria under sarraj , who effectively reduced the province to a police state by imprisoning and exiling landholders who objected to the introduction of egyptian agricultural reform in syria , as well as communists . following the lebanese election of fuad chehab in september 1958 , relations between lebanon and the uar improved considerably . on 25 march 1959 , chehab and nasser met at the lebanese-syrian border and compromised on an end to the lebanese crisis .
united states v. lamacchia 871 f.supp. 535 ( 1994 ) was a case decided by the united states district court for the district of massachusetts which ruled that , under the copyright and cybercrime laws effective at the time , committing copyright infringement for non-commercial motives could not be prosecuted under criminal copyright law . the ruling gave rise to what became known as the " lamacchia loophole , " wherein criminal charges of fraud or copyright infringement would be dismissed under current legal standards , so long as there was no profit motive involved .
programmes , such as the politically fuelled give my head peace ( produced by bbc northern ireland ) and the soap opera river city ( produced by bbc scotland ) , have been created specifically to cater for some viewers in their respective nations , who may have found programmes created for english audiences irrelevant . bbc scotland produces daily programmes for its gaelic-speaking viewers , including current affairs , political and children 's programming such as the popular eorpa and de a-nis ? . bbc wales also produces a large amount of welsh language programming for s4c , particularly news , sport and other programmes , especially the soap opera pobol y cwm ( ' people of the valley ' ) . the uk nations also produce a number of programmes that are shown across the uk , such as bbc scotland 's comedy series chewin ' the fat , and bbc northern ireland 's talk show patrick kielty almost live .

small-scale " expedition tourism " has existed since 1957 and is currently subject to antarctic treaty and environmental protocol provisions , but in effect self-regulated by the international association of antarctica tour operators ( iaato ) . not all vessels associated with antarctic tourism are members of iaato , but iaato members account for 95 % of the tourist activity . travel is largely by small or medium ship , focusing on specific scenic locations with accessible concentrations of iconic wildlife . a total of 37,506 tourists visited during the 2006-07 austral summer with nearly all of them coming from commercial ships . the number was predicted to increase to over 80,000 by 2010 .
video games are playable on various versions of ipods . the original ipod had the game brick ( originally invented by apple 's co-founder steve wozniak ) included as an easter egg hidden feature ; later firmware versions added it as a menu option . later revisions of the ipod added three more games : parachute , solitaire , and music quiz .
as is sometimes common in scientific discoveries , simultaneous developments can occur , as evidenced by a number of inventors who were at work on the telephone . over a period of 18 years , the bell telephone company faced 587 court challenges to its patents , including five that went to the u.s. supreme court , but none was successful in establishing priority over the original bell patent and the bell telephone company never lost a case that had proceeded to a final trial stage . bell 's laboratory notes and family letters were the key to establishing a long lineage to his experiments . the bell company lawyers successfully fought off myriad lawsuits generated initially around the challenges by elisha gray and amos dolbear . in personal correspondence to bell , both gray and dolbear had acknowledged his prior work , which considerably weakened their later claims .
prior to the second world war , birth control was prohibited in many countries , and in the united states even the discussion of contraceptive methods sometimes led to prosecution under comstock laws . the history of the development of oral contraceptives is thus closely tied to the birth control movement and the efforts of activists margaret sanger , mary dennett , and emma goldman . based on fundamental research performed by gregory pincus and synthetic methods for progesterone developed by carl djerassi at syntex and by frank colton at g.d. searle & co . , the first oral contraceptive , enovid , was developed by e.d. searle and co. and approved by the fda in 1960 . the original formulation incorporated vastly excessive doses of hormones , and caused severe side effects . nonetheless , by 1962 , 1.2 million american women were on the pill , and by 1965 the number had increased to 6.5 million . the availability of a convenient form of temporary contraceptive led to dramatic changes in social mores including expanding the range of lifestyle options available to women , reducing the reliance of women on men for contraceptive practice , encouraging the delay of marriage , and increasing pre-marital co-habitation .
many sleeping birds bend their heads over their backs and tuck their bills in their back feathers , although others place their beaks among their breast feathers . many birds rest on one leg , while some may pull up their legs into their feathers , especially in cold weather . perching birds have a tendon locking mechanism that helps them hold on to the perch when they are asleep . many ground birds , such as quails and pheasants , roost in trees . a few parrots of the genus loriculus roost hanging upside down . some hummingbirds go into a nightly state of torpor accompanied with a reduction of their metabolic rates . this physiological adaptation shows in nearly a hundred other species , including owlet-nightjars , nightjars , and woodswallows . one species , the common poorwill , even enters a state of hibernation . birds do not have sweat glands , but they may cool themselves by moving to shade , standing in water , panting , increasing their surface area , fluttering their throat or by using special behaviours like urohidrosis to cool themselves .
portugal 's national energy transmission company , redes energeticas nacionais ( ren ) , uses sophisticated modeling to predict weather , especially wind patterns , and computer programs to calculate energy from the various renewable-energy plants . before the solar / wind revolution , portugal had generated electricity from hydropower plants on its rivers for decades . new programs combine wind and water : wind-driven turbines pump water uphill at night , the most blustery period ; then the water flows downhill by day , generating electricity , when consumer demand is highest . portugal 's distribution system is also now a two-way street . instead of just delivering electricity , it draws electricity from even the smallest generators , like rooftop solar panels . the government aggressively encouraged such contributions by setting a premium price for those who buy rooftop-generated solar electricity .
the revolutionary army established large-scale public works programs and successfully implemented an urban and rural literacy campaign , which helped dramatically increase the literacy rate . in addition to a nationalization program of industry and land , the new regime 's foreign policy placed an emphasis on somalia 's traditional and religious links with the arab world , eventually joining the arab league ( al ) in 1974 . that same year , barre also served as chairman of the organization of african unity ( oau ) , the predecessor of the african union ( au ) .
the landing was north of sevastopol , so the russians had arrayed their army in expectation of a direct attack . the allies advanced and on the morning of 20 september came up to the alma river and the whole russian army . the position was strong , but after three hours , : 424 the frontal attack had driven the russians out of their dug in positions with losses of 6000 men . the battle of the alma had 3,300 allied losses . failing to pursue the retreating forces was one of many strategic errors made during the war , and the russians themselves noted that had they pressed south that day they would have easily captured sevastopol .
by 1990 , the census bureau included more than a dozen ethnic / racial categories on the census , reflecting not only changing social ideas about ethnicity , but the wide variety of immigrants who had come to reside in the united states due to changing historical forces and new immigration laws in the 1960s . with a changing society , more citizens have begun to press for acknowledging multiracial ancestry . the census bureau changed its data collection by allowing people to self-identify as more than one ethnicity . some ethnic groups are concerned about the potential political and economic effects , as federal assistance to historically underserved groups has depended on census data . according to the census bureau , as of 2002 , over 75 % of all african americans had multiracial ancestries .
in the first post war years tito was widely considered a communist leader very loyal to moscow , indeed , he was often viewed as second only to stalin in the eastern bloc . in fact , stalin and tito had an uneasy alliance from the start , with stalin considering tito too independent .
along with secular matters , readers also favoured an alphabetical ordering scheme over cumbersome works arranged along thematic lines . the historian charles porset , commenting on alphabetization , has said that " as the zero degree of taxonomy , alphabetical order authorizes all reading strategies ; in this respect it could be considered an emblem of the enlightenment . " for porset , the avoidance of thematic and hierarchical systems thus allows free interpretation of the works and becomes an example of egalitarianism . encyclopedias and dictionaries also became more popular during the age of reason as the number of educated consumers who could afford such texts began to multiply . in the later half of the 18th century , the number of dictionaries and encyclopedias published by decade increased from 63 between 1760 and 1769 to approximately 148 in the decade proceeding the french revolution ( 1780-1789 ) . along with growth in numbers , dictionaries and encyclopedias also grew in length , often having multiple print runs that sometimes included in supplemented editions .
from 22 march through 26 march 1991 , mass pro-democracy rallies and a nationwide strike was held in both urban and rural communities , which became known as les evenements ( " the events " ) or the march revolution . in bamako , in response to mass demonstrations organized by university students and later joined by trade unionists and others , soldiers opened fire indiscriminately on the nonviolent demonstrators . riots broke out briefly following the shootings . barricades as well as roadblocks were erected and traore declared a state of emergency and imposed a nightly curfew . despite an estimated loss of 300 lives over the course of four days , nonviolent protesters continued to return to bamako each day demanding the resignation of the dictatorial president and the implementation of democratic policies .
in 1941 , reza shah was forced to abdicate in favor of his son , mohammad reza pahlavi , and established the persian corridor , a massive supply route that would last until the end of the ongoing war . the presence of so many foreign troops in the nation also culminated in the soviet-backed establishment of two puppet regimes in the nation ; the azerbaijan people 's government , and the republic of mahabad . as the soviet union refused to relinquish the occupied iranian territory , the iran crisis of 1946 was followed , which particularly resulted in the dissolution of both puppet states , and the withdrawal of the soviets .
freemasonry , as it exists in various forms all over the world , has a membership estimated by the united grand lodge of england at around six million worldwide . the fraternity is administratively organised into independent grand lodges ( or sometimes grand orients ) , each of which governs its own masonic jurisdiction , which consists of subordinate ( or constituent ) lodges . the largest single jurisdiction , in terms of membership , is the united grand lodge of england ( with a membership estimated at around a quarter million ) . the grand lodge of scotland and grand lodge of ireland ( taken together ) have approximately 150,000 members . in the united states total membership is just under two million .
simple stepper motor drivers entirely energize or entirely de-energize the field windings , leading the rotor to " cog " to a limited number of positions ; more sophisticated drivers can proportionally control the power to the field windings , allowing the rotors to position between the cog points and thereby rotate extremely smoothly . this mode of operation is often called microstepping . computer controlled stepper motors are one of the most versatile forms of positioning systems , particularly when part of a digital servo-controlled system .
the united states and the soviet union were the first two countries to recognize the state of israel , having declared recognition roughly simultaneously . the united states regards israel as its " most reliable partner in the middle east , " based on " common democratic values , religious affinities , and security interests . " their bilateral relations are multidimensional and the united states is the principal proponent of the arab-israeli peace process . the united states and israeli views differ on some issues , such as the golan heights , jerusalem , and settlements . the united states has provided $ 68 billion in military assistance and $ 32 billion in grants to israel since 1967 , under the foreign assistance act ( period beginning 1962 ) , more than any other country for that period until 2003 .
due to its location in the pacific ring of fire , seattle is in a major earthquake zone . on february 28 , 2001 , the magnitude 6.8 nisqually earthquake did significant architectural damage , especially in the pioneer square area ( built on reclaimed land , as are the industrial district and part of the city center ) , but caused only one fatality . other strong quakes occurred on january 26 , 1700 ( estimated at 9 magnitude ) , december 14 , 1872 ( 7.3 or 7.4 ) , april 13 , 1949 ( 7.1 ) , and april 29 , 1965 ( 6.5 ) . the 1965 quake caused three deaths in seattle directly , and one more by heart failure . although the seattle fault passes just south of the city center , neither it nor the cascadia subduction zone has caused an earthquake since the city 's founding . the cascadia subduction zone poses the threat of an earthquake of magnitude 9.0 or greater , capable of seriously damaging the city and collapsing many buildings , especially in zones built on fill .
bacteria can be grown in the laboratory on nutrient culture media , but viruses need living cells in which to replicate . many vaccines to infectious diseases can be grown in fertilised chicken eggs . millions of eggs are used each year to generate the annual flu vaccine requirements , a complex process that takes about six months after the decision is made as to what strains of virus to include in the new vaccine . a problem with using eggs for this purpose is that people with egg allergies are unable to be immunised , but this disadvantage may be overcome as new techniques for cell-based rather than egg-based culture become available . cell-based culture will also be useful in a pandemic when it may be difficult to acquire a sufficiently large quantity of suitable sterile , fertile eggs .
new york city is home to the headquarters of the national football league , major league baseball , the national basketball association , the national hockey league , and major league soccer . the new york metropolitan area hosts the most sports teams in these five professional leagues . participation in professional sports in the city predates all professional leagues , and the city has been continuously hosting professional sports since the birth of the brooklyn dodgers in 1882 . the city has played host to over forty major professional teams in the five sports and their respective competing leagues , both current and historic . four of the ten most expensive stadiums ever built worldwide ( metlife stadium , the new yankee stadium , madison square garden , and citi field ) are located in the new york metropolitan area . madison square garden , its predecessor , as well as the original yankee stadium and ebbets field , are some of the most famous sporting venues in the world , the latter two having been commemorated on u.s. postage stamps .
kathmandu is located in the northwestern part of the kathmandu valley to the north of the bagmati river and covers an area of 50.67 km2 ( 19.56 sq mi ) . the average elevation is 1,400 metres ( 4,600 ft ) above sea level . the city is directly bounded by several other municipalities of the kathmandu valley : south of the bagmati by lalitpur sub-metropolitan city ( patan ) with which it today forms one urban area surrounded by a ring road , to the southwest by kirtipur municipality and to the east by madyapur thimi municipality . to the north the urban area extends into several village development committees . however , the urban agglomeration extends well beyond the neighboring municipalities , e. g. to bhaktapur and just about covers the entire kathmandu valley .
located in yangtze river delta area and the center of east china , nanjing is home to one of the world 's largest inland ports . nanjing is also one of the fifteen sub-provincial cities in the people 's republic of china 's administrative structure , enjoying jurisdictional and economic autonomy only slightly less than that of a province . nanjing has been ranked seventh in the evaluation of " cities with strongest comprehensive strength " issued by the national statistics bureau , and second in the evaluation of cities with most sustainable development potential in the yangtze river delta . it has also been awarded the title of 2008 habitat scroll of honour of china , special un habitat scroll of honour award and national civilized city . nanjing boasts many high-quality universities and research institutes , with the number of universities listed in 100 national key universities ranking third , including nanjing university . the ratio of college students to total population ranks no.1 among large cities nationwide . nanjing is one of the three chinese top research centres according to nature index .
in 1968 , tito offered czechoslovak leader alexander dubcek to fly to prague on three hours notice if dubcek needed help in facing down the soviets . in april 1969 , tito removed generals ivan gosnjak and rade hamovic in the aftermath of the invasion of czechoslovakia due to the unpreparedness of the yugoslav army to respond to a similar invasion of yugoslavia .
nigeriasat-2 , nigeria 's second satellite , was built as a high-resolution earth satellite by surrey space technology limited , a united kingdom-based satellite technology company . it has 2.5-metre resolution panchromatic ( very high resolution ) , 5-metre multispectral ( high resolution , nir red , green and red bands ) , and 32-metre multispectral ( medium resolution , nir red , green and red bands ) antennas , with a ground receiving station in abuja . the nigeriasat-2 spacecraft alone was built at a cost of over £ 35 million . this satellite was launched into orbit from a military base in china .
the increased consumption of reading materials of all sorts was one of the key features of the " social " enlightenment . developments in the industrial revolution allowed consumer goods to be produced in greater quantities at lower prices , encouraging the spread of books , pamphlets , newspapers and journals - " media of the transmission of ideas and attitudes . " commercial development likewise increased the demand for information , along with rising populations and increased urbanisation . however , demand for reading material extended outside of the realm of the commercial , and outside the realm of the upper and middle classes , as evidenced by the bibliotheque bleue . literacy rates are difficult to gauge , but in france at least , the rates doubled over the course of the 18th century . reflecting the decreasing influence of religion , the number of books about science and art published in paris doubled from 1720 to 1780 , while the number of books about religion dropped to just one-tenth of the total .
the elevator motor was located at the top of the shaft or beside the bottom of the shaft . pushing the handle forward would cause the cab to rise ; backwards would make it sink . the harder the pressure , the faster the elevator would move . the handle also served as a dead man switch : if the operator let go of the handle , it would return to its upright position , causing the elevator cab to stop . in time , safety interlocks would ensure that the inner and outer doors were closed before the elevator was allowed to move .
the scientific evidence is mixed as to whether companionship of a dog can enhance human physical health and psychological wellbeing . studies suggesting that there are benefits to physical health and psychological wellbeing have been criticised for being poorly controlled , and finding that " [ t ] he health of elderly people is related to their health habits and social supports but not to their ownership of , or attachment to , a companion animal . " earlier studies have shown that people who keep pet dogs or cats exhibit better mental and physical health than those who do not , making fewer visits to the doctor and being less likely to be on medication than non-guardians .
economic conditions have started to improve considerably , after a period of stagnation , due to the adoption of more liberal economic policies by the government as well as increased revenues from tourism and a booming stock market . in its annual report , the international monetary fund ( imf ) has rated egypt as one of the top countries in the world undertaking economic reforms . some major economic reforms undertaken by the government since 2003 include a dramatic slashing of customs and tariffs . a new taxation law implemented in 2005 decreased corporate taxes from 40 % to the current 20 % , resulting in a stated 100 % increase in tax revenue by the year 2006 .
during his term as praetor in the iberian peninsula ( modern portugal and spain ) , pompey 's contemporary julius caesar defeated two local tribes in battle . after his term as consul in 59 bc , he was appointed to a five-year term as the proconsular governor of cisalpine gaul ( part of current northern italy ) , transalpine gaul ( current southern france ) and illyria ( part of the modern balkans ) . not content with an idle governorship , caesar strove to find reason to invade gaul ( modern france and belgium ) , which would give him the dramatic military success he sought . when two local tribes began to migrate on a route that would take them near ( not into ) the roman province of transalpine gaul , caesar had the barely sufficient excuse he needed for his gallic wars , fought between 58 bc and 49 bc .
the older 78 format continued to be mass-produced alongside the newer formats using new materials until about 1960 in the u.s. , and in a few countries , such as india ( where some beatles recordings were issued on 78 ) , into the 1960s . for example , columbia records ' last reissue of frank sinatra songs on 78 rpm records was an album called young at heart , issued november 1 , 1954 . as late as the 1970s , some children 's records were released at the 78 rpm speed . in the united kingdom , the 78 rpm single lasted longer than in the united states and the 45 rpm took longer to become popular . the 78 rpm was overtaken in popularity by the 45 rpm in the late 1950s , as teenagers became increasingly affluent .
paul vi did away with much of the regal splendor of the papacy . he was the last pope to date to be crowned ; his successor pope john paul i replaced the papal coronation ( which paul had already substantially modified , but which he left mandatory in his 1975 apostolic constitution romano pontifici eligendo ) with a papal inauguration . paul vi donated his own papal tiara , a gift from his former archdiocese of milan , to the basilica of the national shrine of the immaculate conception in washington , dc ( where it is on permanent display in the crypt ) as a gift to american catholics .
united states president barack obama and key advisers introduced a series of regulatory proposals in june 2009 . the proposals address consumer protection , executive pay , bank financial cushions or capital requirements , expanded regulation of the shadow banking system and derivatives , and enhanced authority for the federal reserve to safely wind-down systemically important institutions , among others . in january 2010 , obama proposed additional regulations limiting the ability of banks to engage in proprietary trading . the proposals were dubbed " the volcker rule , " in recognition of paul volcker , who has publicly argued for the proposed changes .
before the early 20th century , treatments for infections were based primarily on medicinal folklore . mixtures with antimicrobial properties that were used in treatments of infections were described over 2000 years ago . many ancient cultures , including the ancient egyptians and ancient greeks , used specially selected mold and plant materials and extracts to treat infections . more recent observations made in the laboratory of antibiosis between microorganisms led to the discovery of natural antibacterials produced by microorganisms . louis pasteur observed , " if we could intervene in the antagonism observed between some bacteria , it would offer perhaps the greatest hopes for therapeutics . " the term ' antibiosis ' , meaning " against life , " was introduced by the french bacteriologist jean paul vuillemin as a descriptive name of the phenomenon exhibited by these early antibacterial drugs . antibiosis was first described in 1877 in bacteria when louis pasteur and robert koch observed that an airborne bacillus could inhibit the growth of bacillus anthracis . these drugs were later renamed antibiotics by selman waksman , an american microbiologist , in 1942 . synthetic antibiotic chemotherapy as a science and development of antibacterials began in germany with paul ehrlich in the late 1880s . ehrlich noted certain dyes would color human , animal , or bacterial cells , whereas others did not . he then proposed the idea that it might be possible to create chemicals that would act as a selective drug that would bind to and kill bacteria without harming the human host . after screening hundreds of dyes against various organisms , in 1907 , he discovered a medicinally useful drug , the synthetic antibacterial salvarsan now called arsphenamine .
seeking to harm enemies becomes corruption when official powers are illegitimately used as means to this end . for example , trumped-up charges are often brought up against journalists or writers who bring up politically sensitive issues , such as a politician 's acceptance of bribes .
the tradition of estonian song festivals ( laulupidu ) started at the height of the estonian national awakening in 1869 . today , it is one of the largest amateur choral events in the world . in 2004 , about 100,000 people participated in the song festival . since 1928 , the tallinn song festival grounds ( lauluvaljak ) have hosted the event every five years in july . the last festival took place in july 2014 . in addition , youth song festivals are also held every four or five years , the last of them in 2011 , and the next is scheduled for 2017 .
mexico city is one of the most important economic hubs in latin america . the city proper ( federal district ) produces 15.8 % of the country 's gross domestic product . according to a study conducted by pwc , mexico city had a gdp of $ 390 billion , ranking it as the eighth richest city in the world after the greater metropolitan areas of tokyo , new york city , los angeles , chicago , paris , london and osaka / kobe ( and the richest in the whole of latin america ) . excluding the rest of the mexican economy , mexico city alone would rank as the 30th largest economy in the world . mexico city is the greatest contributor to the country 's industrial gdp ( 15.8 % ) and also the greatest contributor to the country 's gdp in the service sector ( 25.3 % ) . due to the limited non-urbanized space at the south - most of which is protected through environmental laws - the contribution of the federal district in agriculture is the smallest of all federal entities in the country . mexico city has one of the world 's fastest-growing economies and its gdp is set to double by 2020 .
a large percentage of herbivores have mutualistic gut flora that help them digest plant matter , which is more difficult to digest than animal prey . this gut flora is made up of cellulose-digesting protozoans or bacteria living in the herbivores ' intestines . coral reefs are the result of mutualisms between coral organisms and various types of algae that live inside them . most land plants and land ecosystems rely on mutualisms between the plants , which fix carbon from the air , and mycorrhyzal fungi , which help in extracting water and minerals from the ground .
in 2003 , nintendo announced that a new the legend of zelda game was in the works for the gamecube by the same team that had created the cel-shaded the wind waker . at the following year 's game developers conference , director eiji aonuma unintentionally revealed that the game 's sequel was in development under the working title the wind waker 2 ; it was set to use a similar graphical style to that of its predecessor . nintendo of america told aonuma that north american sales of the wind waker were sluggish because its cartoon appearance created the impression that the game was designed for a young audience . concerned that the sequel would have the same problem , aonuma expressed to producer shigeru miyamoto that he wanted to create a realistic zelda game that would appeal to the north american market . miyamoto , hesitant about solely changing the game 's presentation , suggested the team 's focus should instead be on coming up with gameplay innovations . he advised that aonuma should start by doing what could not be done in ocarina of time , particularly horseback combat .

on the other hand , belgian federalism is federated with three components . an affirmative resolution concerning brussels ' place in the federal system passed in the parliaments of wallonia and brussels . these resolutions passed against the desires of dutch-speaking parties , who are generally in favour of a federal system with two components ( i.e. the dutch and french communities of belgium ) . however , the flemish representatives in the parliament of the brussels capital-region voted in favour of the brussels resolution , with the exception of one party . the chairman of the walloon parliament stated on july 17 , 2008 that , " brussels would take an attitude . " brussels ' parliament passed the resolution on july 18 , 2008 :
distinguishing motifs of islamic architecture have always been ordered repetition , radiating structures , and rhythmic , metric patterns . in this respect , fractal geometry has been a key utility , especially for mosques and palaces . other features employed as motifs include columns , piers and arches , organized and interwoven with alternating sequences of niches and colonnettes . the role of domes in islamic architecture has been considerable . its usage spans centuries , first appearing in 691 with the construction of the dome of the rock mosque , and recurring even up until the 17th century with the taj mahal . and as late as the 19th century , islamic domes had been incorporated into european architecture .
the efforts of military commanders to channel the divine will were on occasion less successful . in the early days of rome 's war against carthage , the commander publius claudius pulcher ( consul 249 bc ) launched a sea campaign " though the sacred chickens would not eat when he took the auspices . " in defiance of the omen , he threw them into the sea , " saying that they might drink , since they would not eat . he was defeated , and on being bidden by the senate to appoint a dictator , he appointed his messenger glycias , as if again making a jest of his country 's peril . " his impiety not only lost the battle but ruined his career .
the city is also well provided for in amateur men 's and women 's rugby with a number of teams in and around the city , the oldest of which is trojans rfc who were promoted to london south west 2 division in 2008 / 9 . a notable former player is anthony allen , who played with leicester tigers as a centre . tottonians are also in london south west division 2 and southampton rfc are in hampshire division 1 in 2009 / 10 , alongside millbrook rfc and eastleigh rfc . many of the sides run mini and midi teams from under sevens up to under sixteens for both boys and girls .
the largest parks in the central area of london are three of the eight royal parks , namely hyde park and its neighbour kensington gardens in the west , and regent 's park to the north . hyde park in particular is popular for sports and sometimes hosts open-air concerts . regent 's park contains london zoo , the world 's oldest scientific zoo , and is near the tourist attraction of madame tussauds wax museum . primrose hill in the northern part of regent 's park at 256 feet ( 78 m ) is a popular spot to view the city skyline .
the debating societies discussed an extremely wide range of topics . before the enlightenment , most intellectual debates revolved around " confessional " - that is , catholic , lutheran , reformed ( calvinist ) , or anglican issues , and the main aim of these debates was to establish which bloc of faith ought to have the " monopoly of truth and a god-given title to authority . " after this date everything thus previously rooted in tradition was questioned and often replaced by new concepts in the light of philosophical reason . after the second half of the 17th century and during the 18th century , a " general process of rationalization and secularization set in , " and confessional disputes were reduced to a secondary status in favor of the " escalating contest between faith and incredulity . "
the amoy dialect ( xiamen ) is a hybrid of the quanzhou and zhangzhou dialects . taiwanese is also a hybrid of these two dialects . taiwanese in northern taiwan tends to be based on the quanzhou variety , whereas the taiwanese spoken in southern taiwan tends to be based on zhangzhou speech . there are minor variations in pronunciation and vocabulary between quanzhou and zhangzhou dialects . the grammar is generally the same . additionally , extensive contact with the japanese language has left a legacy of japanese loanwords in taiwanese hokkien . on the other hand , the variants spoken in singapore and malaysia have a substantial number of loanwords from malay and to a lesser extent , from english and other chinese varieties , such as the closely related teochew and some cantonese .
during his period in milan , montini was known as a progressive member of the catholic hierarchy . montini went new ways in pastoral care , which he reformed . he used his authority to ensure that the liturgical reforms of pius xii were carried out at the local level and employed innovative methods to reach the people of milan : huge posters announced that 1,000 voices would speak to them from 10 to 24 november 1957 . more than 500 priests and many bishops , cardinals and lay persons delivered 7,000 sermons in the period not only in churches but in factories , meeting halls , houses , courtyards , schools , offices , military barracks , hospitals , hotels and other places , where people meet . his goal was the re-introduction of faith to a city without much religion . " if only we can say our father and know what this means , then we would understand the christian faith . "
a number of novel ideas about religion developed with the enlightenment , including deism and talk of atheism . deism , according to thomas paine , is the simple belief in god the creator , with no reference to the bible or any other miraculous source . instead , the deist relies solely on personal reason to guide his creed , which was eminently agreeable to many thinkers of the time . atheism was much discussed , but there were few proponents . wilson and reill note that , " in fact , very few enlightened intellectuals , even when they were vocal critics of christianity , were true atheists . rather , they were critics of orthodox belief , wedded rather to skepticism , deism , vitalism , or perhaps pantheism . " some followed pierre bayle and argued that atheists could indeed be moral men . many others like voltaire held that without belief in a god who punishes evil , the moral order of society was undermined . that is , since atheists gave themselves to no supreme authority and no law , and had no fear of eternal consequences , they were far more likely to disrupt society . bayle ( 1647-1706 ) observed that in his day , " prudent persons will always maintain an appearance of [ religion ] .. " he believed that even atheists could hold concepts of honor and go beyond their own self-interest to create and interact in society . locke said that if there were no god and no divine law , the result would be moral anarchy : every individual " could have no law but his own will , no end but himself . he would be a god to himself , and the satisfaction of his own will the sole measure and end of all his actions . "
in february 1981 , queen travelled to south america as part of the game tour , and became the first major rock band to play in latin american stadiums . the tour included five shows in argentina , one of which drew the largest single concert crowd in argentine history with an audience of 300,000 in buenos aires and two concerts at the morumbi stadium in sao paulo , brazil , where they played to an audience of more than 131,000 people in the first night ( then the largest paying audience for a single band anywhere in the world ) and more than 120,000 people the following night . in october of the same year , queen performed for more than 150,000 fans on 9 october at monterrey ( estadio universitario ) and 17 and 18 at puebla ( estadio zaragoza ) , mexico . on 24 and 25 november , queen played two sell out nights at the montreal forum , quebec , canada . one of mercury 's most notable performances of the game 's final track , " save me , " took place in montreal , and the concert is recorded in the live album , queen rock montreal .
southern italy ( magna graecia ) and south-eastern sicily had been colonized by the greeks during the 8th century . in 4th century sicily the leading greek city and hegemon was syracuse . during the hellenistic period the leading figure in sicily was agathocles of syracuse ( 361 - 289 bce ) who seized the city with an army of mercenaries in 317 bce . agathocles extended his power throughout most of the greek cities in sicily , fought a long war with the carthaginians , at one point invading tunisia in 310 and defeating a carthaginian army there . this was the first time a european force had invaded the region . after this war he controlled most of south-east sicily and had himself proclaimed king , in imitation of the hellenistic monarchs of the east . agathocles then invaded italy ( c . 300 bce ) in defense of tarentum against the bruttians and romans , but was unsuccessful .
population has outstripped the supply of freshwater , usually from rainfall . the northern atolls get 50 inches ( 1,300 mm ) of rainfall annually ; the southern atolls about twice that . the threat of drought is commonplace throughout the island chains .
after the kangxi emperor 's death in the winter of 1722 , his fourth son , prince yong ( 雍親王 ) , became the yongzheng emperor . in the later years of kangxi 's reign , yongzheng and his brothers had fought , and there were rumours that he had usurped the throne ( most of the rumours believe that yongzheng 's brother yingzhen ( kangxi 's 14th son ) is the real successor of kangxi emperor , the reason why yingzhen failed to sit on the throne is because yongzheng and his confidant keduo long tampered the content of kangxi 's testament at the night when kangxi passed away ) , a charge for which there is little evidence . in fact , his father had trusted him with delicate political issues and discussed state policy with him . when yongzheng came to power at the age of 45 , he felt a sense of urgency about the problems which had accumulated in his father 's later years and did not need instruction in how to exercise power . in the words of one recent historian , he was " severe , suspicious , and jealous , but extremely capable and resourceful , " and in the words of another , turned out to be an " early modern state-maker of the first order . "
noether 's theorem ( 1918 ) states that any differentiable symmetry of the action of a physical system has a corresponding conservation law . noether 's theorem has become a fundamental tool of modern theoretical physics and the calculus of variations . a generalisation of the seminal formulations on constants of motion in lagrangian and hamiltonian mechanics ( 1788 and 1833 , respectively ) , it does not apply to systems that cannot be modeled with a lagrangian ; for example , dissipative systems with continuous symmetries need not have a corresponding conservation law .
the threat that caused gordon , diplomat and military officer , to publish the article was resumption of work on a railway from russia to the persian gulf . gordon , a published author , had not used the term previously , but he was to use it from then on .
groups of humans have always identified themselves as distinct from neighboring groups , but such differences have not always been understood to be natural , immutable and global . these features are the distinguishing features of how the concept of race is used today . in this way the idea of race as we understand it today came about during the historical process of exploration and conquest which brought europeans into contact with groups from different continents , and of the ideology of classification and typology found in the natural sciences .
the special clerical court handles crimes allegedly committed by clerics , although it has also taken on cases involving lay people . the special clerical court functions independently of the regular judicial framework and is accountable only to the supreme leader . the court 's rulings are final and cannot be appealed . the assembly of experts , which meets for one week annually , comprises 86 " virtuous and learned " clerics elected by adult suffrage for eight-year terms . as with the presidential and parliamentary elections , the guardian council determines candidates ' eligibility . the assembly elects the supreme leader and has the constitutional authority to remove the supreme leader from power at any time . it has not challenged any of the supreme leader 's decisions .
anthropologists believe the most significant benefit would have been the use of dogs ' robust sense of smell to assist with the hunt . the relationship between the presence of a dog and success in the hunt is often mentioned as a primary reason for the domestication of the wolf , and a 2004 study of hunter groups with and without a dog gives quantitative support to the hypothesis that the benefits of cooperative hunting was an important factor in wolf domestication .
although he began his tenure as governor with record high approval ratings ( as high as 89 % in december 2003 ) , he left office with a record low 23 % , only one percent higher than that of gray davis 's when he was recalled in october 2003 .
in english , the country is popularly known as either " burma " or " myanmar " i / ˈmjɑːnˌmɑːr / . both these names are derived from the name of the majority burmese bamar ethnic group . myanmar is considered to be the literary form of the name of the group , while burma is derived from " bamar , " the colloquial form of the group 's name . depending on the register used , the pronunciation would be bama ( pronounced : [ bəma ] ) or myamah ( pronounced : [ mjəma ] ) . the name burma has been in use in english since the 18th century .
with nitrides containing aluminium , most often algan and algainn , even shorter wavelengths are achievable . ultraviolet leds in a range of wavelengths are becoming available on the market . near-uv emitters at wavelengths around 375-395 nm are already cheap and often encountered , for example , as black light lamp replacements for inspection of anti-counterfeiting uv watermarks in some documents and paper currencies . shorter-wavelength diodes , while substantially more expensive , are commercially available for wavelengths down to 240 nm . as the photosensitivity of microorganisms approximately matches the absorption spectrum of dna , with a peak at about 260 nm , uv led emitting at 250-270 nm are to be expected in prospective disinfection and sterilization devices . recent research has shown that commercially available uva leds ( 365 nm ) are already effective disinfection and sterilization devices . uv-c wavelengths were obtained in laboratories using aluminium nitride ( 210 nm ) , boron nitride ( 215 nm ) and diamond ( 235 nm ) .
to put it another way , a thing or person is often seen as having a " defining essence " or a " core identity " that is unchanging , and describes what the thing or person really is . in this way of thinking , things and people are seen as fundamentally the same through time , with any changes being qualitative and secondary to their core identity ( e.g. " mark 's hair has turned gray as he has gotten older , but he is still the same person " ) . but in whitehead 's cosmology , the only fundamentally existent things are discrete " occasions of experience " that overlap one another in time and space , and jointly make up the enduring person or thing . on the other hand , what ordinary thinking often regards as " the essence of a thing " or " the identity / core of a person " is an abstract generalization of what is regarded as that person or thing 's most important or salient features across time . identities do not define people , people define identities . everything changes from moment to moment , and to think of anything as having an " enduring essence " misses the fact that " all things flow , " though it is often a useful way of speaking .
this was also a period of alternatives to nightclubs , the warehouse party , acid house , rave and outdoor festival scenes of the late 1980s and early 1990s were havens for the latest trends in electronic dance music , especially house and its ever-more hypnotic , synthetic offspring techno and trance , in clubs like the infamous warsaw ballroom better known as warsaw and the mix where djs like david padilla ( who was the resident dj for both ) and radio . the new sound fed back into mainstream clubs across the country . the scene in sobe , along with a bustling secondhand market for electronic instruments and turntables , had a strong democratizing effect , offering amateur , " bedroom " djs the opportunity to become proficient and popular as both music players and producers , regardless of the whims of the professional music and club industries . some of these notable djs are john benetiz ( better known as jellybean benetiz ) , danny tenaglia , and david padilla .
additionally , the italian eritrea administration opened a number of new factories , which produced buttons , cooking oil , pasta , construction materials , packing meat , tobacco , hide and other household commodities . in 1939 , there were around 2,198 factories and most of the employees were eritrean citizens . the establishment of industries also made an increase in the number of both italians and eritreans residing in the cities . the number of italians residing in the territory increased from 4,600 to 75,000 in five years ; and with the involvement of eritreans in the industries , trade and fruit plantation was expanded across the nation , while some of the plantations were owned by eritreans .
at the end of the first decade of the 21st century , downtown tucson underwent a revitalization effort by city planners and the business community . the primary project was rio nuevo , a large retail and community center that has been stalled in planning for more than ten years . downtown is generally regarded as the area bordered by 17th street to the south , i-10 to the west , and 6th street to the north , and toole avenue and the union pacific ( formerly southern pacific ) railroad tracks , site of the historic train depot and " locomotive # 1673 , " built in 1900 . downtown is divided into the presidio district , the barrio viejo , and the congress street arts and entertainment district . some authorities include the 4th avenue shopping district , which is set just northeast of the rest of downtown and connected by an underpass beneath the uprr tracks .
the american observer ingersoll reported at this time that " as to the accuracy of the bombing of military objectives , here i make no qualifications . the aim is surprisingly , astonishingly , amazingly inaccurate ... the physical damage to civilian london , to sum up , was more general and more extensive than i had imagined . the damage to military targets much less , " and stated that he had seen numerous examples of untouched targets surrounded by buildings destroyed by errant bombs . for example , in two months of bombing , battersea power station , perhaps the largest single target in london , had only received one minor hit ( " a nick " ) . no bridge over the thames had been hit , and the docks were still functioning despite great damage . an airfield was hit 56 times but the runways were never damaged and the field was never out of operation , despite german pilots ' familiarity with it from prewar commercial flights . ingersoll wrote that the difference between the failure of the german campaign against military targets versus its success in continental europe was the raf retaining control of the air . : 79-80,174
above the sessions exist presbyteries , which have area responsibilities . these are composed of teaching elders and ruling elders from each of the constituent congregations . the presbytery sends representatives to a broader regional or national assembly , generally known as the general assembly , although an intermediate level of a synod sometimes exists . this congregation / presbytery / synod / general assembly schema is based on the historical structure of the larger presbyterian churches , such as the church of scotland or the presbyterian church ( u.s.a. ) ; some bodies , such as the presbyterian church in america and the presbyterian church in ireland , skip one of the steps between congregation and general assembly , and usually the step skipped is the synod . the church of scotland has now abolished the synod .

the causes of world war i included many factors , including the conflicts and antagonisms of the four decades leading up to the war . the triple entente was the name given to the loose alignment between the united kingdom , france , and russia after the signing of the anglo-russian entente in 1907 . the alignment of the three powers , supplemented by various agreements with japan , the united states , and spain , constituted a powerful counterweight to the triple alliance of germany , austria-hungary , and italy , the third having concluded an additional secret agreement with france effectively nullifying her alliance commitments . militarism , alliances , imperialism , and nationalism played major roles in the conflict . the immediate origins of the war lay in the decisions taken by statesmen and generals during the july crisis of 1914 , the spark ( or casus belli ) for which was the assassination of archduke franz ferdinand of austria .
law and finance have long been driving forces in the economy . the city is home to both the united states court of appeals for the fourth circuit , one of 13 united states courts of appeals , and the federal reserve bank of richmond , one of 12 federal reserve banks , as well as offices for international companies such as genworth financial , capitalone , philip morris usa , and numerous other banks and brokerages . richmond is also home to four of the largest law firms in the united states : hunton & williams , mcguirewoods , williams mullen , and leclairryan . another law firm with a major richmond presence is troutman sanders , which merged with richmond-based mays & valentine llp in 2001 .
calculating that no further russian advance was likely until 1758 , frederick moved the bulk of his eastern forces to pomerania under the command of marshal lehwaldt where they were to repel the swedish invasion . in short order , the prussian army drove the swedes back , occupied most of swedish pomerania , and blockaded its capital stralsund . george ii of great britain , on the advice of his british ministers , revoked the convention of klosterzeven , and hanover reentered the war . over the winter the new commander of the hanoverian forces , duke ferdinand of brunswick , regrouped his army and launched a series of offensives that drove the french back across the river rhine . the british had suffered further defeats in north america , particularly at fort william henry . at home , however , stability had been established . since 1756 , successive governments led by newcastle and pitt had fallen . in august 1757 , the two men agreed to a political partnership and formed a coalition government that gave new , firmer direction to the war effort . the new strategy emphasised both newcastle 's commitment to british involvement on the continent , particularly in defence of germany , and william pitt 's determination to use naval power to seize french colonies around the globe . this " dual strategy " would dominate british policy for the next five years .
this set inherits a group operation ( sometimes called coset multiplication , or coset addition ) from the original group g : ( gn ) • ( hn ) = ( gh ) n for all g and h in g. this definition is motivated by the idea ( itself an instance of general structural considerations outlined above ) that the map g → g / n that associates to any element g its coset gn be a group homomorphism , or by general abstract considerations called universal properties . the coset en = n serves as the identity in this group , and the inverse of gn in the quotient group is ( gn ) − 1 = ( g − 1 ) n.e [ › ]
the earliest recorded western philosophy of time was expounded by the ancient egyptian thinker ptahhotep ( c . 2650-2600 bc ) , who said , " do not lessen the time of following desire , for the wasting of time is an abomination to the spirit . " the vedas , the earliest texts on indian philosophy and hindu philosophy , dating back to the late 2nd millennium bc , describe ancient hindu cosmology , in which the universe goes through repeated cycles of creation , destruction , and rebirth , with each cycle lasting 4,320,000 years . ancient greek philosophers , including parmenides and heraclitus , wrote essays on the nature of time .
the outreach director of hrtr , susan prager , is also the communication director of " friends of falun gong , " a quasi-government non-profit funded by fmr . congressman tom lanto 's wife and ambassador mark palmer of ned . a major setback to the event was caused by footballer diego maradona , scheduled to open the relay through buenos aires , pulling out in an attempt to avoid the olympic controversy . trying to avoid the scenes that marred the relay in the uk , france and the us , the city government designed a complex security operative to protect the torch relay , involving 1200 police officers and 3000 other people , including public employees and volunteers . overall , the protests were peaceful in nature , although there were a few incidents such as the throwing of several water balloons in an attempt to extinguish the olympic flame , and minor scuffles between olympic protesters and supporters from chinese immigrant communities .
raskin was authorized to start hiring for the project in september 1979 , and he immediately asked his long-time colleague , brian howard , to join him . his initial team would eventually consist of himself , howard , joanna hoffman , burrell smith , and bud tribble . the rest of the original mac team would include bill atkinson , bob belleville , steve capps , george crow , donn denman , chris espinosa , andy hertzfeld , bruce horn , susan kare , larry kenyon , and caroline rose with steve jobs leading the project .
according to the 2000 edition of a popular physical anthropology textbook , forensic anthropologists are overwhelmingly in support of the idea of the basic biological reality of human races . forensic physical anthropologist and professor george w. gill has said that the idea that race is only skin deep " is simply not true , as any experienced forensic anthropologist will affirm " and " many morphological features tend to follow geographic boundaries coinciding often with climatic zones . this is not surprising since the selective forces of climate are probably the primary forces of nature that have shaped human races with regard not only to skin color and hair form but also the underlying bony structures of the nose , cheekbones , etc . ( for example , more prominent noses humidify air better . ) " while he can see good arguments for both sides , the complete denial of the opposing evidence " seems to stem largely from socio-political motivation and not science at all . " he also states that many biological anthropologists see races as real yet " not one introductory textbook of physical anthropology even presents that perspective as a possibility . in a case as flagrant as this , we are not dealing with science but rather with blatant , politically motivated censorship . "
in 2010 , bills to abolish the death penalty in kansas and in south dakota ( which had a de facto moratorium at the time ) were rejected . idaho ended its de facto moratorium , during which only one volunteer had been executed , on november 18 , 2011 by executing paul ezra rhoades ; south dakota executed donald moeller on october 30 , 2012 , ending a de facto moratorium during which only two volunteers had been executed . of the 12 prisoners whom nevada has executed since 1976 , 11 waived their rights to appeal . kentucky and montana have executed two prisoners against their will ( ky : 1997 and 1999 , mt : 1995 and 1998 ) and one volunteer , respectively ( ky : 2008 , mt : 2006 ) . colorado ( in 1997 ) and wyoming ( in 1992 ) have executed only one prisoner , respectively .
in 2005 , estonia joined the european union 's nordic battle group . it has also shown continued interest in joining the nordic council . whereas in 1992 russia accounted for 92 % of estonia 's international trade , today there is extensive economic interdependence between estonia and its nordic neighbours : three quarters of foreign investment in estonia originates in the nordic countries ( principally finland and sweden ) , to which estonia sends 42 % of its exports ( as compared to 6.5 % going to russia , 8.8 % to latvia , and 4.7 % to lithuania ) . on the other hand , the estonian political system , its flat rate of income tax , and its non-welfare-state model distinguish it from the nordic countries and their nordic model , and indeed from many other european countries .
most of the space in the brain is taken up by axons , which are often bundled together in what are called nerve fiber tracts . a myelinated axon is wrapped in a fatty insulating sheath of myelin , which serves to greatly increase the speed of signal propagation . ( there are also unmyelinated axons ) . myelin is white , making parts of the brain filled exclusively with nerve fibers appear as light-colored white matter , in contrast to the darker-colored grey matter that marks areas with high densities of neuron cell bodies .
the remains of a 6th-century synagogue have been uncovered in sepphoris , which was an important centre of jewish culture between the 3rd-7th centuries and a multicultural town inhabited by jews , christians and pagans . the mosaic reflects an interesting fusion of jewish and pagan beliefs . in the center of the floor the zodiac wheel was depicted . helios sits in the middle , in his sun chariot , and each zodiac is matched with a jewish month . along the sides of the mosaic are strips depicting biblical scenes , such as the binding of isaac , as well as traditional rituals , including a burnt sacrifice and the offering of fruits and grains .
diarrhea , also spelled diarrhoea , is the condition of having at least three loose or liquid bowel movements each day . it often lasts for a few days and can result in dehydration due to fluid loss . signs of dehydration often begin with loss of the normal stretchiness of the skin and irritable behaviour . this can progress to decreased urination , loss of skin color , a fast heart rate , and a decrease in responsiveness as it becomes more severe . loose but non-watery stools in babies who are breastfed , however , may be normal .
a molecule of dietary fat typically consists of several fatty acids ( containing long chains of carbon and hydrogen atoms ) , bonded to a glycerol . they are typically found as triglycerides ( three fatty acids attached to one glycerol backbone ) . fats may be classified as saturated or unsaturated depending on the detailed structure of the fatty acids involved . saturated fats have all of the carbon atoms in their fatty acid chains bonded to hydrogen atoms , whereas unsaturated fats have some of these carbon atoms double-bonded , so their molecules have relatively fewer hydrogen atoms than a saturated fatty acid of the same length . unsaturated fats may be further classified as monounsaturated ( one double-bond ) or polyunsaturated ( many double-bonds ) . furthermore , depending on the location of the double-bond in the fatty acid chain , unsaturated fatty acids are classified as omega-3 or omega-6 fatty acids . trans fats are a type of unsaturated fat with trans-isomer bonds ; these are rare in nature and in foods from natural sources ; they are typically created in an industrial process called ( partial ) hydrogenation . there are nine kilocalories in each gram of fat . fatty acids such as conjugated linoleic acid , catalpic acid , eleostearic acid and punicic acid , in addition to providing energy , represent potent immune modulatory molecules .
the growth in women 's football has seen major competitions being launched at both national and international level mirroring the male competitions . women 's football has faced many struggles . it had a " golden age " in the united kingdom in the early 1920s when crowds reached 50,000 at some matches ; this was stopped on 5 december 1921 when england 's football association voted to ban the game from grounds used by its member clubs . the fa 's ban was rescinded in december 1969 with uefa voting to officially recognise women 's football in 1971 . the fifa women 's world cup was inaugurated in 1991 and has been held every four years since , while women 's football has been an olympic event since 1996 .

the longmen shan fault system is situated in the eastern border of the tibetan plateau and contains several faults . this earthquake ruptured at least two imbricate structures in longmen shan fault system , i.e. the beichuan fault and the guanxian-anxian fault . in the epicentral area , the average slip in beichuan fault was about 3.5 metres ( 11 ft ) vertical , 3.5 metres ( 11 ft ) horizontal-parallel to the fault , and 4.8 metres ( 16 ft ) horizontal-perpendicular to the fault . in the area about 30 kilometres ( 19 mi ) northeast of the epicenter , the surface slip on beichuan fault was almost purely dextral strike-slip up to about 3 metres ( 9.8 ft ) , while the average slip in guanxian-anxian fault was about 2 metres ( 6 ft 7 in ) vertical and 2.3 metres ( 7 ft 7 in ) horizontal .
the american idol songwriter contest was also held this season . from ten of the most popular submissions , each of the final two contestants chose a song to perform , although neither of their selections was used as the " coronation song . " the winning song , " the time of my life , " was recorded by david cook and released on may 22 , 2008 .
located in yangtze river delta area and the center of east china , nanjing is home to one of the world 's largest inland ports . nanjing is also one of the fifteen sub-provincial cities in the people 's republic of china 's administrative structure , enjoying jurisdictional and economic autonomy only slightly less than that of a province . nanjing has been ranked seventh in the evaluation of " cities with strongest comprehensive strength " issued by the national statistics bureau , and second in the evaluation of cities with most sustainable development potential in the yangtze river delta . it has also been awarded the title of 2008 habitat scroll of honour of china , special un habitat scroll of honour award and national civilized city . nanjing boasts many high-quality universities and research institutes , with the number of universities listed in 100 national key universities ranking third , including nanjing university . the ratio of college students to total population ranks no.1 among large cities nationwide . nanjing is one of the three chinese top research centres according to nature index .
however , performance enhancements cannot be generalized as the benefits and limitations of the system are dependent on many factors . one problem is that the system is subject to gaming . sometimes , one person enters the destination for a large group of people going to the same floor . the dispatching algorithm is usually unable to completely cater for the variation , and latecomers may find the elevator they are assigned to is already full . also , occasionally , one person may press the floor multiple times . this is common with up / down buttons when people believe this to be an effective way to hurry elevators . however , this will make the computer think multiple people are waiting and will allocate empty cars to serve this one person .
about 40,000,000 tons were produced in 1984 [ needs update ] . it is obtained as the " heavy " ( i.e. , difficult to distill ) fraction . material with a boiling point greater than around 500 ° c is considered asphalt . vacuum distillation separates it from the other components in crude oil ( such as naphtha , gasoline and diesel ) . the resulting material is typically further treated to extract small but valuable amounts of lubricants and to adjust the properties of the material to suit applications . in a de-asphalting unit , the crude asphalt is treated with either propane or butane in a supercritical phase to extract the lighter molecules , which are then separated . further processing is possible by " blowing " the product : namely reacting it with oxygen . this step makes the product harder and more viscous .
one of the ways to prevent or slow down the transmission of infectious diseases is to recognize the different characteristics of various diseases . some critical disease characteristics that should be evaluated include virulence , distance traveled by victims , and level of contagiousness . the human strains of ebola virus , for example , incapacitate their victims extremely quickly and kill them soon after . as a result , the victims of this disease do not have the opportunity to travel very far from the initial infection zone . also , this virus must spread through skin lesions or permeable membranes such as the eye . thus , the initial stage of ebola is not very contagious since its victims experience only internal hemorrhaging . as a result of the above features , the spread of ebola is very rapid and usually stays within a relatively confined geographical area . in contrast , the human immunodeficiency virus ( hiv ) kills its victims very slowly by attacking their immune system . as a result , many of its victims transmit the virus to other individuals before even realizing that they are carrying the disease . also , the relatively low virulence allows its victims to travel long distances , increasing the likelihood of an epidemic .

[ web 5 ] pema chodron calls them the " four limitless ones . " of the four , metta or loving-kindness meditation is perhaps the best known . [ web 5 ] the four immeasurables are taught as a form of meditation that cultivates " wholesome attitudes towards all sentient beings . " [ web 6 ] [ web 7 ]
pubs often have traditional names . a common name is the " marquis of granby . " these pubs were named after john manners , marquess of granby , who was the son of john manners , 3rd duke of rutland and a general in the 18th century british army . he showed a great concern for the welfare of his men , and on their retirement , provided funds for many of them to establish taverns , which were subsequently named after him . all pubs granted their licence in 1780 were called the royal george [ citation needed ] , after king george iii , and the twentieth anniversary of his coronation .
victoria was the daughter of prince edward , duke of kent and strathearn , the fourth son of king george iii . both the duke of kent and king george iii died in 1820 , and victoria was raised under close supervision by her german-born mother princess victoria of saxe-coburg-saalfeld . she inherited the throne aged 18 , after her father 's three elder brothers had all died , leaving no surviving legitimate children . the united kingdom was already an established constitutional monarchy , in which the sovereign held relatively little direct political power . privately , victoria attempted to influence government policy and ministerial appointments ; publicly , she became a national icon who was identified with strict standards of personal morality .
adult contemporary music ( ac ) is a style of music , ranging from 1960s vocal and 1970s soft rock music to predominantly ballad-heavy music of the present day , with varying degrees of easy listening , pop , soul , rhythm and blues , quiet storm , and rock influence . adult contemporary is rather a continuation of the easy listening and soft rock style that became popular in the 1960s and 1970s with some adjustments that reflect the evolution of pop / rock music .
the first historical mention of the use of hops in beer was from 822 ad in monastery rules written by adalhard the elder , also known as adalard of corbie , though the date normally given for widespread cultivation of hops for use in beer is the thirteenth century . before the thirteenth century , and until the sixteenth century , during which hops took over as the dominant flavouring , beer was flavoured with other plants ; for instance , grains of paradise or alehoof . combinations of various aromatic herbs , berries , and even ingredients like wormwood would be combined into a mixture known as gruit and used as hops are now used . some beers today , such as fraoch ' by the scottish heather ales company and cervoise lancelot by the french brasserie-lancelot company , use plants other than hops for flavouring .
grazing organisms may also kill their prey species , but this is seldom the case . while some herbivores like zooplankton live on unicellular phytoplankton and therefore , by the individualized nature of the organism , kill their prey , many only eat a small part of the plant . grazing livestock may pull some grass out at the roots , but most is simply grazed upon , allowing the plant to regrow once again . kelp is frequently grazed in subtidal kelp forests , but regrows at the base of the blade continuously to cope with browsing pressure . animals may also be ' grazed ' upon ; female mosquitos land on hosts briefly to gain sufficient proteins for the development of their offspring . starfish may be grazed on , being capable of regenerating lost arms .
the situation became so tense that war with the united states seemed imminent . on april 22 , 1914 , on the initiative of felix a. sommerfeld and sherburne hopkins , pancho villa traveled to juarez to calm fears along the border and asked president wilson 's emissary george carothers to tell " senor wilson " that he had no problems with the american occupation of veracruz . carothers wrote to secretary william jennings bryan : " as far as he was concerned we could keep vera cruz [ sic ] and hold it so tight that not even water could get in to huerta and . . . he could not feel any resentment . " whether trying to please the u.s. government or through the diplomatic efforts of sommerfeld and carothers , or maybe as a result of both , villa stepped out from under carranza 's stated foreign policy .
burdened with debt , in 2004 vivendi universal sold 80 % of vivendi universal entertainment ( including the studio and theme parks ) to general electric , parent of nbc . the resulting media super-conglomerate was renamed nbcuniversal , while universal studios inc. remained the name of the production subsidiary . after that deal , ge owned 80 % of nbc universal ; vivendi held the remaining 20 % , with an option to sell its share in 2006 . ge purchased vivendi 's share in nbcu in 2011 and in turn sold 51 % of the company to cable provider comcast . comcast merged the former ge subsidiary with its own cable-television programming assets , creating the current nbcuniversal . following federal communications commission ( fcc ) approval , the comcast-ge deal was closed on jan 29 , 2011 . in march 2013 , comcast bought the remaining 49 % of nbcuniversal for $ 16.7 billion .
in article 3 of the treaty of san francisco between the allied powers and japan , which came into force in april 1952 , the u.s. put the outlying islands of the ryukyus , including the island of okinawa - home to over 1 million okinawans related to the japanese - and the bonin islands , the volcano islands , and iwo jima into u.s. trusteeship . all these trusteeships were slowly returned to japanese rule . okinawa was returned on may 15 , 1972 , but the u.s. stations troops in the island 's bases as a defense for japan .
protestants have founded hospitals , homes for disabled or elderly people , educational institutions , organizations that give aid to developing countries , and other social welfare agencies . in the nineteenth century , throughout the anglo-american world , numerous dedicated members of all protestant denominations were active in social reform movements such as the abolition of slavery , prison reforms , and woman suffrage . as an answer to the " social question " of the nineteenth century , germany under chancellor otto von bismarck introduced insurance programs that led the way to the welfare state ( health insurance , accident insurance , disability insurance , old-age pensions ) . to bismarck this was " practical christianity . " these programs , too , were copied by many other nations , particularly in the western world .
the battle of osan , the first significant american engagement of the korean war , involved the 540-soldier task force smith , which was a small forward element of the 24th infantry division which had been flown in from japan . on 5 july 1950 , task force smith attacked the north koreans at osan but without weapons capable of destroying the north koreans ' tanks . they were unsuccessful ; the result was 180 dead , wounded , or taken prisoner . the kpa progressed southwards , pushing back the us force at pyongtaek , chonan , and chochiwon , forcing the 24th division 's retreat to taejeon , which the kpa captured in the battle of taejon ; the 24th division suffered 3,602 dead and wounded and 2,962 captured , including the division 's commander , major general william f. dean .
after a new wave of un sanctions , on 11 march 2013 , north korea claimed that it had invalidated the 1953 armistice . on 13 march 2013 , north korea confirmed it ended the 1953 armistice and declared north korea " is not restrained by the north-south declaration on non-aggression . " on 30 march 2013 , north korea stated that it had entered a " state of war " with south korea and declared that " the long-standing situation of the korean peninsula being neither at peace nor at war is finally over . " speaking on 4 april 2013 , the u.s. secretary of defense , chuck hagel , informed the press that pyongyang had " formally informed " the pentagon that it had " ratified " the potential usage of a nuclear weapon against south korea , japan and the united states of america , including guam and hawaii . hagel also stated that the united states would deploy the terminal high altitude area defense anti-ballistic missile system to guam , because of a credible and realistic nuclear threat from north korea .
most of the differences in the revised budget deficit numbers were due to a temporary change of accounting practices by the new government , i.e. , recording expenses when military material was ordered rather than received . however , it was the retroactive application of esa95 methodology ( applied since 2000 ) by eurostat , that finally raised the reference year ( 1999 ) budget deficit to 3.38 % of gdp , thus exceeding the 3 % limit . this led to claims that greece ( similar claims have been made about other european countries like italy ) had not actually met all five accession criteria , and the common perception that greece entered the eurozone through " falsified " deficit numbers .
child soldiers have and continue to play a major part in the burmese army as well as burmese rebel movements . the independent reported in june 2012 that " children are being sold as conscripts into the burmese military for as little as $ 40 and a bag of rice or a can of petrol . " the un 's special representative of the secretary-general for children and armed conflict , radhika coomaraswamy , who stepped down from her position a week later , met representatives of the government of myanmar on 5 july 2012 and stated that she hoped the government 's signing of an action plan would " signal a transformation . " in september 2012 , the myanmar armed forces released 42 child soldiers and the international labour organization met with representatives of the government as well as the kachin independence army to secure the release of more child soldiers . according to samantha power , a us delegation raised the issue of child soldiers with the government in october 2012 . however , she did not comment on the government 's progress towards reform in this area .
lancashire has a mostly comprehensive system with four state grammar schools . not including sixth form colleges , there are 77 state schools ( not including burnley 's new schools ) and 24 independent schools . the clitheroe area has secondary modern schools . sixth form provision is limited at most schools in most districts , with only fylde and lancaster districts having mostly sixth forms at schools . the rest depend on fe colleges and sixth form colleges , where they exist . south ribble has the largest school population and fylde the smallest ( only three schools ) . burnley 's schools have had a new broom and have essentially been knocked down and started again in 2006 . there are many church of england and catholic faith schools in lancashire .
along with two inequality systems expressing economic efficiency . in this model , the ( transposed ) probability vector p represents the prices of the goods while the probability vector q represents the " intensity " at which the production process would run . the unique solution λ represents the growth factor which is 1 plus the rate of growth of the economy ; the rate of growth equals the interest rate . proving the existence of a positive growth rate and proving that the growth rate equals the interest rate were remarkable achievements , even for von neumann .
clothing protects against many things that might injure the uncovered human body . clothes protect people from the elements , including rain , snow , wind , and other weather , as well as from the sun . however , clothing that is too sheer , thin , small , tight , etc . , offers less protection . clothes also reduce risk during activities such as work or sport . some clothing protects from specific environmental hazards , such as insects , noxious chemicals , weather , weapons , and contact with abrasive substances . conversely , clothing may protect the environment from the clothing wearer , as with doctors wearing medical scrubs .
in the u.s. , a push for revisions of the fd & c act emerged from congressional hearings led by senator estes kefauver of tennessee in 1959 . the hearings covered a wide range of policy issues , including advertising abuses , questionable efficacy of drugs , and the need for greater regulation of the industry . while momentum for new legislation temporarily flagged under extended debate , a new tragedy emerged that underscored the need for more comprehensive regulation and provided the driving force for the passage of new laws .
at the 52nd annual grammy awards , beyonce received ten nominations , including album of the year for i am ... sasha fierce , record of the year for " halo , " and song of the year for " single ladies ( put a ring on it ) , " among others . she tied with lauryn hill for most grammy nominations in a single year by a female artist . in 2010 , beyonce was featured on lady gaga 's single " telephone " and its music video . the song topped the us pop songs chart , becoming the sixth number-one for both beyonce and gaga , tying them with mariah carey for most number-ones since the nielsen top 40 airplay chart launched in 1992 . " telephone " received a grammy award nomination for best pop collaboration with vocals .
during the high middle ages , which began after 1000 , the population of europe increased greatly as technological and agricultural innovations allowed trade to flourish and the medieval warm period climate change allowed crop yields to increase . manorialism , the organisation of peasants into villages that owed rent and labour services to the nobles , and feudalism , the political structure whereby knights and lower-status nobles owed military service to their overlords in return for the right to rent from lands and manors , were two of the ways society was organised in the high middle ages . the crusades , first preached in 1095 , were military attempts by western european christians to regain control of the holy land from the muslims . kings became the heads of centralised nation states , reducing crime and violence but making the ideal of a unified christendom more distant . intellectual life was marked by scholasticism , a philosophy that emphasised joining faith to reason , and by the founding of universities . the theology of thomas aquinas , the paintings of giotto , the poetry of dante and chaucer , the travels of marco polo , and the architecture of gothic cathedrals such as chartres are among the outstanding achievements toward the end of this period , and into the late middle ages .
the principal battles of the stalemate include the battle of bloody ridge ( 18 august-15 september 1951 ) , the battle of the punchbowl ( 31 august-21 september 1951 ) , the battle of heartbreak ridge ( 13 september-15 october 1951 ) , the battle of old baldy ( 26 june-4 august 1952 ) , the battle of white horse ( 6-15 october 1952 ) , the battle of triangle hill ( 14 october-25 november 1952 ) , the battle of hill eerie ( 21 march-21 june 1952 ) , the sieges of outpost harry ( 10-18 june 1953 ) , the battle of the hook ( 28-29 may 1953 ) , the battle of pork chop hill ( 23 march-16 july 1953 ) , and the battle of kumsong ( 13-27 july 1953 ) .
after the decline of the teutonic order following its defeat in the battle of grunwald in 1410 , and the defeat of the livonian order in the battle of swienta on 1 september 1435 , the livonian confederation agreement was signed on 4 december 1435 . the livonian confederation ceased to exist during the livonian war ( 1558-82 ) . the wars had reduced the estonian population from about 250-300,000 people before the livonian war to 120-140,000 in the 1620s . the grand duchy of moscow and tsardom of russia also attempted invasions in 1481 and 1558 , both of which were unsuccessful .
ibn khaldun can be regarded as the earliest scientific systematic sociologist . the modern sociology , emerged in the early 19th century as the academic response to the modernization of the world . among many early sociologists ( e.g. , emile durkheim ) , the aim of sociology was in structuralism , understanding the cohesion of social groups , and developing an " antidote " to social disintegration . max weber was concerned with the modernization of society through the concept of rationalization , which he believed would trap individuals in an " iron cage " of rational thought . some sociologists , including georg simmel and w. e. b. du bois , utilized more microsociological , qualitative analyses . this microlevel approach played an important role in american sociology , with the theories of george herbert mead and his student herbert blumer resulting in the creation of the symbolic interactionism approach to sociology .
the blue ridge mountains , rising in southern pennsylvania and there known as south mountain , attain elevations of about 2,000 ft ( 600 m ) in that state . south mountain achieves its highest point just below the mason-dixon line in maryland at quirauk mountain 2,145 ft ( 654 m ) and then diminishes in height southward to the potomac river . once in virginia the blue ridge again reaches 2,000 ft ( 600 m ) and higher . in the virginia blue ridge , the following are some of the highest peaks north of the roanoke river : stony man 4,031 ft ( 1,229 m ) , hawksbill mountain 4,066 ft ( 1,239 m ) , apple orchard mountain 4,225 ft ( 1,288 m ) and peaks of otter 4,001 and 3,875 ft ( 1,220 and 1,181 m ) . south of the roanoke river , along the blue ridge , are virginia 's highest peaks including whitetop mountain 5,520 ft ( 1,680 m ) and mount rogers 5,729 ft ( 1,746 m ) , the highest point in the commonwealth .
over the years , the mughals began to have internal disputes which greatly distracted them at times . the mughal empire continued to weaken , and with the decline of the mughal empire in the 18th century , rajputana came under the suzerainty of the marathas . the marathas , who were hindus from the state of what is now maharashtra , ruled rajputana for most of the eighteenth century . the maratha empire , which had replaced the mughal empire as the overlord of the subcontinent , was finally replaced by the british empire in 1818 .
people of irish descent form the largest single ethnic group in the city , making up 15.8 % of the population , followed by italians , accounting for 8.3 % of the population . people of west indian and caribbean ancestry are another sizable group , at 6.0 % , about half of whom are of haitian ancestry . over 27,000 chinese americans made their home in boston city proper in 2013 , and the city hosts a growing chinatown accommodating heavily traveled chinese-owned bus lines to and from chinatown , manhattan . some neighborhoods , such as dorchester , have received an influx of people of vietnamese ancestry in recent decades . neighborhoods such as jamaica plain and roslindale have experienced a growing number of dominican americans . the city and greater area also has a growing immigrant population of south asians , including the tenth-largest indian community in the country .
various theories for the decline of the native american populations emphasize epidemic diseases , conflicts with europeans , and conflicts among warring tribes . scholars now believe that , among the various contributing factors , epidemic disease was the overwhelming cause of the population decline of the american natives . some believe that after first contacts with europeans and africans , old world diseases caused the death of 90 to 95 % of the native population of the new world in the following 150 years . smallpox killed up to one third of the native population of hispaniola in 1518 . by killing the incan ruler huayna capac , smallpox caused the inca civil war . smallpox was only the first epidemic . typhus ( probably ) in 1546 , influenza and smallpox together in 1558 , smallpox again in 1589 , diphtheria in 1614 , measles in 1618 - all ravaged the remains of inca culture .
most early home computer systems developed their own 8-bit character sets containing line-drawing and game glyphs , and often filled in some or all of the control characters from 0-31 with more graphics . kaypro cp / m computers used the " upper " 128 characters for the greek alphabet . the ibm pc defined code page 437 , which replaced the control-characters with graphic symbols such as smiley faces , and mapped additional graphic characters to the upper 128 positions . operating systems such as dos supported these code pages , and manufacturers of ibm pcs supported them in hardware . digital equipment corporation developed the multinational character set ( dec-mcs ) for use in the popular vt220 terminal as one of the first extensions designed more for international languages than for block graphics . the macintosh defined mac os roman and postscript also defined a set , both of these contained both international letters and typographic punctuation marks instead of graphics , more like modern character sets .
alpine crystals have been studied and collected for hundreds of years , and began to be classified in the 18th century . leonhard euler studied the shapes of crystals , and by the 19th century crystal hunting was common in alpine regions . david friedrich wiser amassed a collection of 8000 crystals that he studied and documented . in the 20th century robert parker wrote a well-known work about the rock crystals of the swiss alps ; at the same period a commission was established to control and standardize the naming of alpine minerals .
in 1980 , when the stadium was in need of redesign to meet uefa criteria , the club raised money by offering supporters the opportunity to inscribe their name on the bricks for a small fee . the idea was popular with supporters , and thousands of people paid the fee . later this became the centre of controversy when media in madrid picked up reports that one of the stones was inscribed with the name of long-time real madrid chairman and franco supporter santiago bernabeu . in preparation for the 1992 summer olympics two tiers of seating were installed above the previous roofline . it has a current capacity of 99,354 making it the largest stadium in europe .
different societies apply differing criteria regarding who is classified as " black , " and these social constructs have also changed over time . in a number of countries , societal variables affect classification as much as skin color , and the social criteria for " blackness " vary . for example , in north america the term black people is not necessarily an indicator of skin color or majority ethnic ancestry , but it is instead a socially based racial classification related to being african american , with a family history associated with institutionalized slavery . in south africa and latin america , for instance , mixed-race people are generally not classified as " black . " in south pacific regions such as australia and melanesia , european colonists applied the term " black " or it was used by populations with different histories and ethnic origin .
in buddhism , karma ( from sanskrit : " action , work " ) is the force that drives samsara - the cycle of suffering and rebirth for each being . good , skillful deeds ( pali : " kusala " ) and bad , unskillful ( pali : " akusala " ) actions produce " seeds " in the mind that come to fruition either in this life or in a subsequent rebirth . the avoidance of unwholesome actions and the cultivation of positive actions is called sila . karma specifically refers to those actions of body , speech or mind that spring from mental intent ( cetana ) , and bring about a consequence or phala " fruit " or vipaka " result . "
later that summer , the russians invaded memel with 75,000 troops . memel had one of the strongest fortresses in prussia . however , after five days of artillery bombardment the russian army was able to storm it . the russians then used memel as a base to invade east prussia and defeated a smaller prussian force in the fiercely contested battle of gross-jagersdorf on 30 august 1757 . however , it was not yet able to take konigsberg and retreated soon afterward . still , it was a new threat to prussia . not only was frederick forced to break off his invasion of bohemia , he was now forced to withdraw further into prussian-controlled territory . his defeats on the battlefield brought still more opportunist nations into the war . sweden declared war on prussia and invaded pomerania with 17,000 men . sweden felt this small army was all that was needed to occupy pomerania and felt the swedish army would not need to engage with the prussians because the prussians were occupied on so many other fronts .
this makes for a large number of takeoffs and landings and it is not unusual for flights to be delayed in the holding pattern before landing . following the airport 's master plan , infraero built a second runway , which was finished in 2006 . in 2007 , the airport handled 11,119,872 passengers . the main building 's third floor , with 12 thousand square meters , has a panoramic deck , a food court , shops , four movie theatres with total capacity of 500 people , and space for exhibitions . brasilia airport has 136 vendor spaces . the airport is located about 11 km ( 6.8 mi ) from the central area of brasilia , outside the metro system . the area outside the airport 's main gate is lined with taxis as well as several bus line services which connect the airport to brasilia 's central district . the parking lot accommodates 1,200 cars . the airport is serviced by domestic and regional airlines ( tam , gol , azul , webjet , trip and avianca ) , in addition to a number of international carriers . in 2012 , brasilia 's international airport was won by the inframerica consortium , formed by the brazilian engineering company engevix and the argentine corporacion america holding company , with a 50 % stake each . during the 25-year concession , the airport may be expanded to up to 40 million passengers a year .
a second problem with materialism is that it obscures the importance of relations . it sees every object as distinct and discrete from all other objects . each object is simply an inert clump of matter that is only externally related to other things . the idea of matter as primary makes people think of objects as being fundamentally separate in time and space , and not necessarily related to anything . but in whitehead 's view , relations take a primary role , perhaps even more important than the relata themselves . a student taking notes in one of whitehead 's fall 1924 classes wrote that :
in 1358 , the sakya viceregal regime installed by the mongols in tibet was overthrown in a rebellion by the phagmodru myriarch tai situ changchub gyaltsen ( 1302-1364 ) . the mongol yuan court was forced to accept him as the new viceroy , and changchub gyaltsen and his successors , the phagmodrupa dynasty , gained de facto rule over tibet .
think-tanks such as the world pensions council have also argued that european legislators have pushed somewhat dogmatically for the adoption of the basel ii recommendations , adopted in 2005 , transposed in european union law through the capital requirements directive ( crd ) , effective since 2008 . in essence , they forced european banks , and , more importantly , the european central bank itself e.g. when gauging the solvency of financial institutions , to rely more than ever on standardised assessments of credit risk marketed by two non-european private agencies : moody 's and s & p .
the sun , during the miners ' strike of 1984-85 , supported the police and the thatcher government against the striking num miners , and in particular the union 's president , arthur scargill . on 23 may 1984 , the sun prepared a front page with the headline " mine fuhrer " and a photograph of scargill with his arm in the air , a pose which made him look as though he was giving a nazi salute . the print workers at the sun refused to print it . the sun strongly supported the april 1986 bombing of libya by the us , which was launched from british bases . several civilians were killed during the bombing . their leader was " right ron , right maggie . " that year , labour mp clare short attempted in vain to persuade parliament to outlaw the pictures on page three and gained opprobrium from the newspaper for her stand .
these troubles were followed in 1347 by the black death , a pandemic that spread throughout europe during the following three years . [ ac ] the death toll was probably about 35 million people in europe , about one-third of the population . towns were especially hard-hit because of their crowded conditions . [ ad ] large areas of land were left sparsely inhabited , and in some places fields were left unworked . wages rose as landlords sought to entice the reduced number of available workers to their fields . further problems were lower rents and lower demand for food , both of which cut into agricultural income . urban workers also felt that they had a right to greater earnings , and popular uprisings broke out across europe . among the uprisings were the jacquerie in france , the peasants ' revolt in england , and revolts in the cities of florence in italy and ghent and bruges in flanders . the trauma of the plague led to an increased piety throughout europe , manifested by the foundation of new charities , the self-mortification of the flagellants , and the scapegoating of jews . conditions were further unsettled by the return of the plague throughout the rest of the 14th century ; it continued to strike europe periodically during the rest of the middle ages .
from early christian times , hunting has been forbidden to roman catholic church clerics . thus the corpus juris canonici ( c. ii , x , de cleric. venat . ) says , " we forbid to all servants of god hunting and expeditions through the woods with hounds ; and we also forbid them to keep hawks or falcons . " the fourth council of the lateran , held under pope innocent iii , decreed ( canon xv ) : " we interdict hunting or hawking to all clerics . " the decree of the council of trent is worded more mildly : " let clerics abstain from illicit hunting and hawking " ( sess . xxiv , de reform . , c. xii ) , which seems to imply that not all hunting is illicit , and canonists generally make a distinction declaring noisy ( clamorosa ) hunting unlawful , but not quiet ( quieta ) hunting .
a culinary staple of north carolina is pork barbecue . there are strong regional differences and rivalries over the sauces and methods used in making the barbecue . the common trend across western north carolina is the use of premium grade boston butt . western north carolina pork barbecue uses a tomato-based sauce , and only the pork shoulder ( dark meat ) is used . western north carolina barbecue is commonly referred to as lexington barbecue after the piedmont triad town of lexington , home of the lexington barbecue festival , which attracts over 100,000 visitors each october . eastern north carolina pork barbecue uses a vinegar-and-red-pepper-based sauce and the " whole hog " is cooked , thus integrating both white and dark meat .
walt disney parks and resorts plans on creating original marvel attractions at their theme parks , with hong kong disneyland becoming the first disney theme park to feature a marvel attraction . due to the licensing agreement with universal studios , signed prior to disney 's purchase of marvel , walt disney world and tokyo disney are barred from having marvel characters in their parks . however , this only includes characters universal is currently using , other characters in their " families " ( x-men , avengers , fantastic four , etc . ) , and the villains associated with said characters . this clause has allowed walt disney world to have meet and greets , merchandise , attractions and more with other marvel characters not associated with the characters at islands of adventures , such as star-lord and gamora from guardians of the galaxy as well as baymax and hiro from big hero 6 .
today , computer security comprises mainly " preventive " measures , like firewalls or an exit procedure . a firewall can be defined as a way of filtering network data between a host or a network and another network , such as the internet , and can be implemented as software running on the machine , hooking into the network stack ( or , in the case of most unix-based operating systems such as linux , built into the operating system kernel ) to provide real time filtering and blocking . another implementation is a so-called physical firewall which consists of a separate machine filtering network traffic . firewalls are common amongst machines that are permanently connected to the internet .
presbyterianism is a part of the reformed tradition within protestantism which traces its origins to the british isles . presbyterian churches derive their name from the presbyterian form of church government , which is governed by representative assemblies of elders . many reformed churches are organized this way , but the word " presbyterian , " when capitalized , is often applied uniquely to the churches that trace their roots to the scottish and english churches that bore that name and english political groups that formed during the english civil war . presbyterian theology typically emphasizes the sovereignty of god , the authority of the scriptures , and the necessity of grace through faith in christ . presbyterian church government was ensured in scotland by the acts of union in 1707 which created the kingdom of great britain . in fact , most presbyterians found in england can trace a scottish connection , and the presbyterian denomination was also taken to north america mostly by scots and scots-irish immigrants . the presbyterian denominations in scotland hold to the theology of john calvin and his immediate successors , although there are a range of theological views within contemporary presbyterianism . local congregations of churches which use presbyterian polity are governed by sessions made up of representatives of the congregation ( elders ) ; a conciliar approach which is found at other levels of decision-making ( presbytery , synod and general assembly ) .
in 1916 , he entered the seminary to become a roman catholic priest . he was ordained priest on 29 may 1920 in brescia and celebrated his first holy mass in brescia in the basilica of santa maria delle grazie . montini concluded his studies in milan with a doctorate in canon law in the same year . afterwards he studied at the gregorian university , the university of rome la sapienza and , at the request of giuseppe pizzardo at the accademia dei nobili ecclesiastici . at the age of twenty-five , again at the request of giuseppe pizzardo , montini entered the secretariat of state in 1922 , where he worked under pizzardo together with francesco borgongini-duca , alfredo ottaviani , carlo grano , domenico tardini and francis spellman . consequently , he spent not a day as a parish priest . in 1925 he helped found the publishing house morcelliana in brescia , focused on promoting a ' christian inspired culture ' .
to promote culture utrecht city organizes cultural sundays . during a thematic sunday several organisations create a program , which is open to everyone without , or with a very much reduced , admission fee . there are also initiatives for amateur artists . the city subsidises an organisation for amateur education in arts aimed at all inhabitants ( utrechts centrum voor de kunsten ) , as does the university for its staff and students . additionally there are also several private initiatives . the city council provides coupons for discounts to inhabitants who receive welfare to be used with many of the initiatives .
in the later 1890s and into first decade of the 20th century , structural changes occurred in the operation of the pacific trading companies ; they moved from a practice of having traders resident on each island to instead becoming a business operation where the supercargo ( the cargo manager of a trading ship ) would deal directly with the islanders when a ship visited an island . from 1900 the numbers of palagi traders in tuvalu declined and the last of the palagi traders were fred whibley on niutao , alfred restieaux on nukufetau , and martin kleis on nui . by 1909 there were no more resident palagi traders representing the trading companies , although both whibley and restieaux remained in the islands until their deaths .
king county metro provides frequent stop bus service within the city and surrounding county , as well as a south lake union streetcar line between the south lake union neighborhood and westlake center in downtown . seattle is one of the few cities in north america whose bus fleet includes electric trolleybuses . sound transit currently provides an express bus service within the metropolitan area ; two sounder commuter rail lines between the suburbs and downtown ; its central link light rail line , which opened in 2009 , between downtown and sea-tac airport gives the city its first rapid transit line that has intermediate stops within the city limits . washington state ferries , which manages the largest network of ferries in the united states and third largest in the world , connects seattle to bainbridge and vashon islands in puget sound and to bremerton and southworth on the kitsap peninsula .
blues rock acts that pioneered the sound included cream , the jimi hendrix experience , and the jeff beck group . cream , in songs like " i feel free " ( 1966 ) combined blues rock with pop and psychedelia , particularly in the riffs and guitar solos of eric clapton . jimi hendrix produced a form of blues-influenced psychedelic rock , which combined elements of jazz , blues and rock and roll . from 1967 jeff beck brought lead guitar to new heights of technical virtuosity and moved blues rock in the direction of heavy rock with his band , the jeff beck group . dave davies of the kinks , keith richards of the rolling stones , pete townshend of the who , hendrix , clapton and beck all pioneered the use of new guitar effects like phasing , feedback and distortion . the beatles began producing songs in the new hard rock style beginning with the white album in 1968 and , with the track " helter skelter , " attempted to create a greater level of noise than the who . stephen thomas erlewine of allmusic has described the " proto-metal roar " of " helter skelter , " while ian macdonald argued that " their attempts at emulating the heavy style were without exception embarrassing . "
size , however , is not the only difference : there are also substantial differences in shape . the hindbrain and midbrain of mammals are generally similar to those of other vertebrates , but dramatic differences appear in the forebrain , which is greatly enlarged and also altered in structure . the cerebral cortex is the part of the brain that most strongly distinguishes mammals . in non-mammalian vertebrates , the surface of the cerebrum is lined with a comparatively simple three-layered structure called the pallium . in mammals , the pallium evolves into a complex six-layered structure called neocortex or isocortex . several areas at the edge of the neocortex , including the hippocampus and amygdala , are also much more extensively developed in mammals than in other vertebrates .
about 5 % of the nicaraguan population are indigenous . the largest indigenous group in nicaragua is the miskito people . their territory extended from cape camaron , honduras , to rio grande , nicaragua along the mosquito coast . there is a native miskito language , but large groups speak miskito coast creole , spanish , rama and other languages . the creole english came about through frequent contact with the british who colonized the area . many are christians . traditional miskito society was highly structured with a defined political structure . there was a king , but he did not have total power . instead , the power was split between himself , a governor , a general , and by the 1750s , an admiral . historical information on kings is often obscured by the fact that many of the kings were semi-mythical . another major group is the mayangna ( or sumu ) people , counting some 10,000 people .
the ottoman navy vastly contributed to the expansion of the empire 's territories on the european continent . it initiated the conquest of north africa , with the addition of algeria and egypt to the ottoman empire in 1517 . starting with the loss of greece in 1821 and algeria in 1830 , ottoman naval power and control over the empire 's distant overseas territories began to decline . sultan abdulaziz ( reigned 1861-1876 ) attempted to reestablish a strong ottoman navy , building the largest fleet after those of britain and france . the shipyard at barrow , england , built its first submarine in 1886 for the ottoman empire .
the target audience of natural history was french polite society , evidenced more by the specific discourse of the genre than by the generally high prices of its works . naturalists catered to polite society 's desire for erudition - many texts had an explicit instructive purpose . however , natural history was often a political affair . as e. c. spary writes , the classifications used by naturalists " slipped between the natural world and the social ... to establish not only the expertise of the naturalists over the natural , but also the dominance of the natural over the social . " the idea of taste ( le gout ) was a social indicator : to truly be able to categorize nature , one had to have the proper taste , an ability of discretion shared by all members of polite society . in this way natural history spread many of the scientific developments of the time , but also provided a new source of legitimacy for the dominant class . from this basis , naturalists could then develop their own social ideals based on their scientific works .
english is used as a second language in parts of southern europe . as a primary language , however , english has only a small presence in southern europe , only in gibraltar ( alongside spanish ) and malta ( secondary to maltese ) .
some scientific studies suggest that ozone depletion may have a dominant role in governing climatic change in antarctica ( and a wider area of the southern hemisphere ) . ozone absorbs large amounts of ultraviolet radiation in the stratosphere . ozone depletion over antarctica can cause a cooling of around 6 ° c in the local stratosphere . this cooling has the effect of intensifying the westerly winds which flow around the continent ( the polar vortex ) and thus prevents outflow of the cold air near the south pole . as a result , the continental mass of the east antarctic ice sheet is held at lower temperatures , and the peripheral areas of antarctica , especially the antarctic peninsula , are subject to higher temperatures , which promote accelerated melting . models also suggest that the ozone depletion / enhanced polar vortex effect also accounts for the recent increase in sea ice just offshore of the continent .
after years of demanding greater political autonomy , residents were given the right to directly elect a head of government and the representatives of the unicameral legislative assembly by popular vote in 1997 . ever since , the left-wing party of the democratic revolution ( prd ) has controlled both of them . in recent years , the local government has passed a wave of liberal policies , such as abortion on request , a limited form of euthanasia , no-fault divorce , and same-sex marriage . on january 29 , 2016 , it ceased to be called the federal district ( spanish : distrito federal or d.f. ) and is now in transition to become the country 's 32nd federal entity , giving it a level of autonomy comparable to that of a state . because of a clause in the mexican constitution , however , as the seat of the powers of the union , it can never become a state , lest the capital of the country be relocated elsewhere .
other sources include fortified food and dietary supplements , which come in various forms . a 1998 review concluded that zinc oxide , one of the most common supplements in the united states , and zinc carbonate are nearly insoluble and poorly absorbed in the body . this review cited studies which found low plasma zinc concentrations after zinc oxide and zinc carbonate were consumed compared with those seen after consumption of zinc acetate and sulfate salts . however , harmful excessive supplementation is a problem among the relatively affluent , and should probably not exceed 20 mg / day in healthy people , although the u.s. national research council set a tolerable upper intake of 40 mg / day .
the simplest way to gain information about brain anatomy is by visual inspection , but many more sophisticated techniques have been developed . brain tissue in its natural state is too soft to work with , but it can be hardened by immersion in alcohol or other fixatives , and then sliced apart for examination of the interior . visually , the interior of the brain consists of areas of so-called grey matter , with a dark color , separated by areas of white matter , with a lighter color . further information can be gained by staining slices of brain tissue with a variety of chemicals that bring out areas where specific types of molecules are present in high concentrations . it is also possible to examine the microstructure of brain tissue using a microscope , and to trace the pattern of connections from one brain area to another .
there is an extensive network of caves , including wookey hole , underground rivers , and gorges , including the cheddar gorge and ebbor gorge . the county has many rivers , including the axe , brue , cary , parrett , sheppey , tone and yeo . these both feed and drain the flat levels and moors of mid and west somerset . in the north of the county the river chew flows into the bristol avon . the parrett is tidal almost to langport , where there is evidence of two roman wharfs . at the same site during the reign of king charles i , river tolls were levied on boats to pay for the maintenance of the bridge .
other important venetian mosaics can be found in the cathedral of santa maria assunta in torcello from the 12th century , and in the basilical of santi maria e donato in murano with a restored apse mosaic from the 12th century and a beautiful mosaic pavement ( 1140 ) . the apse of the san cipriano church in murano was decorated with an impressive golden mosaic from the early 13th century showing christ enthroned with mary , st john and the two patron saints , cipriano and cipriana . when the church was demolished in the 19th century , the mosaic was bought by frederick william iv of prussia . it was reassembled in the friedenskirche of potsdam in the 1840s .
treaties are not necessarily permanently binding upon the signatory parties . as obligations in international law are traditionally viewed as arising only from the consent of states , many treaties expressly allow a state to withdraw as long as it follows certain procedures of notification . for example , the single convention on narcotic drugs provides that the treaty will terminate if , as a result of denunciations , the number of parties falls below 40 . many treaties expressly forbid withdrawal . article 56 of the vienna convention on the law of treaties provides that where a treaty is silent over whether or not it can be denounced there is a rebuttable presumption that it cannot be unilaterally denounced unless :
universities created by bilateral or multilateral treaties between states are intergovernmental . an example is the academy of european law , which offers training in european law to lawyers , judges , barristers , solicitors , in-house counsel and academics . euclid ( pole universitaire euclide , euclid university ) is chartered as a university and umbrella organisation dedicated to sustainable development in signatory countries , and the united nations university engages in efforts to resolve the pressing global problems that are of concern to the united nations , its peoples and member states . the european university institute , a post-graduate university specialised in the social sciences , is officially an intergovernmental organisation , set up by the member states of the european union .
however , samoans greatly resented new zealand 's colonial rule , and blamed inflation and the catastrophic 1918 flu epidemic on its misrule . by the late 1920s the resistance movement against colonial rule had gathered widespread support . one of the mau leaders was olaf frederick nelson , a half samoan and half swedish merchant . nelson was eventually exiled during the late 1920s and early 1930s , but he continued to assist the organisation financially and politically . in accordance with the mau 's non-violent philosophy , the newly elected leader , high chief tupua tamasese lealofi , led his fellow uniformed mau in a peaceful demonstration in downtown apia on 28 december 1929 .
in the uk , the medicines and healthcare products regulatory agency approves drugs for use , though the evaluation is done by the european medicines agency , an agency of the european union based in london . normally an approval in the uk and other european countries comes later than one in the usa . then it is the national institute for health and care excellence ( nice ) , for england and wales , who decides if and how the national health service ( nhs ) will allow ( in the sense of paying for ) their use . the british national formulary is the core guide for pharmacists and clinicians .
astronomy : astronomical observations from china constitute the longest continuous sequence from any civilisation and include records of sunspots ( 112 records from 364 bc ) , supernovas ( 1054 ) , lunar and solar eclipses . by the 12th century , they could reasonably accurately make predictions of eclipses , but the knowledge of this was lost during the ming dynasty , so that the jesuit matteo ricci gained much favour in 1601 by his predictions . by 635 chinese astronomers had observed that the tails of comets always point away from the sun .
the federal government of the united states has mandated that " in data collection and presentation , federal agencies are required to use a minimum of two ethnicities : ' hispanic or latino ' and ' not hispanic or latino ' . " the census bureau defines " hispanic or latino " as " a person of cuban , mexican , puerto rican , south or central american or other spanish culture or origin regardless of race . " for discussion of the meaning and scope of the hispanic or latino ethnicity , see the hispanic and latino americans and racial and ethnic demographics of the united states articles .
spanish mendicants in the sixteenth century taught indigenous scribes in their communities to write their languages in latin letters and there is a large number of local-level documents in nahuatl , zapotec , mixtec , and yucatec maya from the colonial era , many of which were part of lawsuits and other legal matters . although spaniards initially taught indigenous scribes alphabetic writing , the tradition became self-perpetuating at the local level . the spanish crown gathered such documentation and contemporary spanish translations were made for legal cases . scholars have translated and analyzed these documents in what is called the new philology to write histories of indigenous peoples from indigenous viewpoints .
relations between ashkenazim and sephardim have not always been warm . north african sepharadim and berber jews were often looked upon by ashkenazim as second-class citizens during the first decade after the creation of israel . this has led to protest movements such as the israeli black panthers led by saadia marciano a moroccan jew . nowadays , relations are getting better . in some instances , ashkenazi communities have accepted significant numbers of sephardi newcomers , sometimes resulting in intermarriage .
a different format , cd-4 ( not to be confused with compact disc ) , by rca , encoded the front-rear difference information on an ultrasonic carrier , which required a special wideband cartridge to capture it on carefully calibrated pickup arm / turntable combinations . cd-4 was even less successful than the two matrixed formats . ( a further problem was that no cutting heads were available that could handle the hf information . that was remedied by cutting at half the speed . later , the special half-speed cutting heads and equalization techniques were employed to get a wider frequency response in stereo with reduced distortion and greater headroom . )
the second truth is that the origin of dukkha can be known . within the context of the four noble truths , the origin of dukkha is commonly explained as craving ( pali : tanha ) conditioned by ignorance ( pali : avijja ) . on a deeper level , the root cause of dukkha is identified as ignorance ( pali : avijja ) of the true nature of things . the third noble truth is that the complete cessation of dukkha is possible , and the fourth noble truth identifies a path to this cessation . [ note 7 ]
prior to 1871 , the government of the united states regularly entered into treaties with native americans but the indian appropriations act of march 3 , 1871 ( ch . 120 , 16 stat . 563 ) had a rider ( 25 u.s.c. § 71 ) attached that effectively ended the president 's treaty making by providing that no indian nation or tribe shall be acknowledged as an independent nation , tribe , or power with whom the united states may contract by treaty . the federal government continued to provide similar contractual relations with the indian tribes after 1871 by agreements , statutes , and executive orders .
the term " late middle ages " refers to one of the three periods of the middle ages , along with the early middle ages and the high middle ages . leonardo bruni was the first historian to use tripartite periodization in his history of the florentine people ( 1442 ) . flavio biondo used a similar framework in decades of history from the deterioration of the roman empire ( 1439-1453 ) . tripartite periodization became standard after the german historian christoph cellarius published universal history divided into an ancient , medieval , and new period ( 1683 ) .
in general , avian influenza is a disease of birds caused by bird-specific influenza a virus that is not normally transferred to people ; however , people in contact with live poultry are at the greatest risk of becoming infected with the virus and this is of particular concern in areas such as southeast asia , where the disease is endemic in the wild bird population and domestic poultry can become infected . the virus possibly could mutate to become highly virulent and infectious in humans and cause an influenza pandemic .
richard sander claims that by artificially elevating minority students into schools they otherwise would not be capable of attending , this discourages them and tends to engender failure and high dropout rates for these students . for example , about half of black college students rank in the bottom 20 percent of their classes , black law school graduates are four times as likely to fail bar exams as are whites , and interracial friendships are more likely to form among students with relatively similar levels of academic preparation ; thus , blacks and hispanics are more socially integrated on campuses where they are less academically mismatched . he claims that the supposed " beneficiaries " of affirmative action - minorities - do not actually benefit and rather are harmed by the policy . sander 's claims have been disputed , and his empirical analyses have been subject to substantial criticism . a group including some of the country 's lead statistical methodologists told the supreme court that sander 's analyses were sufficiently flawed that the court would be wise to ignore them entirely . at the same time many scholars have found that minorities gain substantially from affirmative action .
the neolithic 1 ( ppna ) period began roughly 10,000 years ago in the levant . a temple area in southeastern turkey at gobekli tepe dated around 9,500 bc may be regarded as the beginning of the period . this site was developed by nomadic hunter-gatherer tribes , evidenced by the lack of permanent housing in the vicinity and may be the oldest known human-made place of worship . at least seven stone circles , covering 25 acres ( 10 ha ) , contain limestone pillars carved with animals , insects , and birds . stone tools were used by perhaps as many as hundreds of people to create the pillars , which might have supported roofs . other early ppna sites dating to around 9,500 to 9,000 bce have been found in jericho , israel ( notably ain mallaha , nahal oren , and kfar hahoresh ) , gilgal in the jordan valley , and byblos , lebanon . the start of neolithic 1 overlaps the tahunian and heavy neolithic periods to some degree .

financial problems and a reduction in tourism led to norfolk island 's administration appealing to the australian federal government for assistance in 2010 . in return , the islanders were to pay income tax for the first time but would be eligible for greater welfare benefits . however , by may 2013 agreement had not been reached and islanders were having to leave to find work and welfare . an agreement was finally signed in canberra on 12 march 2015 to replace self-government with a local council but against the wishes of the norfolk island government . a majority of norfolk islanders have objected to the australian plan to make changes to norfolk island without first consulting them and allowing their say with 68 % of voters against forced changes .
since the 16th century , the city has had a bear pit , the barengraben , at the far end of the nydeggbrucke to house its heraldic animals . the currently four bears are now kept in an open-air enclosure nearby , and two other young bears , a present by the russian president , are kept in dahlholzli zoo .
in november 1997 , the website mp3.com was offering thousands of mp3s created by independent artists for free . the small size of mp3 files enabled widespread peer-to-peer file sharing of music ripped from cds , which would have previously been nearly impossible . the first large peer-to-peer filesharing network , napster , was launched in 1999 .
the term can be found used in an october 1845 massachusetts circuit court ruling in the patent case davoll et al. v. brown . , in which justice charles l. woodbury wrote that " only in this way can we protect intellectual property , the labors of the mind , productions and interests are as much a man 's own ... as the wheat he cultivates , or the flocks he rears . " the statement that " discoveries are ... property " goes back earlier . section 1 of the french law of 1791 stated , " all new discoveries are the property of the author ; to assure the inventor the property and temporary enjoyment of his discovery , there shall be delivered to him a patent for five , ten or fifteen years . " in europe , french author a. nion mentioned propriete intellectuelle in his droits civils des auteurs , artistes et inventeurs , published in 1846 .
jiangsu province kun opera is one of the best theatres for kunqu , china 's oldest stage art . it is considered a conservative and traditional troupe . nanjing also has professional opera troupes for the yang , yue ( shaoxing ) , xi and jing ( chinese opera varieties ) as well as suzhou pingtan , spoken theatre and puppet theatre .
countering krugman , peter j. wallison wrote : " it is not true that every bubble - even a large bubble - has the potential to cause a financial crisis when it deflates . " wallison notes that other developed countries had " large bubbles during the 1997-2007 period " but " the losses associated with mortgage delinquencies and defaults when these bubbles deflated were far lower than the losses suffered in the united states when the 1997-2007 [ bubble ] deflated . " according to wallison , the reason the u.s. residential housing bubble ( as opposed to other types of bubbles ) led to financial crisis was that it was supported by a huge number of substandard loans - generally with low or no downpayments .
local television companies in cyprus include the state owned cyprus broadcasting corporation which runs two television channels . in addition on the greek side of the island there are the private channels ant1 cyprus , plus tv , mega channel , sigma tv , nimonia tv ( ntv ) and new extra . in northern cyprus , the local channels are brt , the turkish cypriot equivalent to the cyprus broadcasting corporation , and a number of private channels . the majority of local arts and cultural programming is produced by the cyprus broadcasting corporation and brt , with local arts documentaries , review programmes and filmed drama series .
bermuda 's pink sand beaches and clear , cerulean blue ocean waters are popular with tourists . many of bermuda 's hotels are located along the south shore of the island . in addition to its beaches , there are a number of sightseeing attractions . historic st george 's is a designated world heritage site . scuba divers can explore numerous wrecks and coral reefs in relatively shallow water ( typically 30-40 ft or 9-12 m in depth ) , with virtually unlimited visibility . many nearby reefs are readily accessible from shore by snorkellers , especially at church bay .
on 1 january 1967 , yugoslavia was the first communist country to open its borders to all foreign visitors and abolish visa requirements . in the same year tito became active in promoting a peaceful resolution of the arab-israeli conflict . his plan called for arabs to recognize the state of israel in exchange for territories israel gained .
after years of high increase , the unemployment in portugal has been in a continuous falling trend since the third quarter of 2014 , decreasing from a peak of 17.7 % achieved in the early 2013 to a rate of 11.9 % in the second quarter of 2015 . however , it is high still high compared with what was the normal average portuguese unemployment rate in the past . in the second quarter of 2008 the unemployment rate was 7.3 % , but the rate immediately rose the following period . by december 2009 , unemployment had surpassed the 10 % mark nationwide in the wake of worldwide events , by 2010 , the rate was around 11 % and in 2011 it was above 12 % . [ citation needed ] the first quarter of 2013 signified a new unemployment rate record for portugal , as it reached 17.7 % - up from 17 % in the previous quarter - and the government has predicted an 18.5 % unemployment rate in 2014 . however , in the third quarter of the same year , it has surprisingly declined to a rate of 15.6 % . from then on , the unemployment downtrend continued , declining to 13.9 % in the second semester of 2014 and to 11.9 % in the second quarter of 2015 .
himachal was one of the few states that had remained largely untouched by external customs , largely due to its difficult terrain . with the technological advancements the state has changed very rapidly . it is a multireligional , multicultural as well as multilingual state like other indian states . some of the most commonly spoken languages includes hindi , pahari , dogri , mandeali kangri , mandyali , gojri and kinnauri . the caste communities residing in himachal include the khatri , brahmins of the hindu faith and the sikh brahmin caste bhatra , rajputs , gujjars , gaddis , ghirth ( choudhary ) , kannets , rathis and kolis , sood there are tribal populations in the state which mainly comprise kinnars , pangawals , sulehria , and lahaulis.the people of himachal pradesh are very simple and live a traditional ' pahari ' lifestyle .
english is the official language in the state of montana , as it is in many u.s. states . english is also the language of the majority . according to the 2000 u.s. census , 94.8 percent of the population aged 5 and older speak english at home . spanish is the language most commonly spoken at home other than english . there were about 13,040 spanish-language speakers in the state ( 1.4 percent of the population ) in 2011 . there were also 15,438 ( 1.7 percent of the state population ) speakers of indo-european languages other than english or spanish , 10,154 ( 1.1 percent ) speakers of a native american language , and 4,052 ( 0.4 percent ) speakers of an asian or pacific islander language . other languages spoken in montana ( as of 2013 ) include assiniboine ( about 150 speakers in the montana and canada ) , blackfoot ( about 100 speakers ) , cheyenne ( about 1,700 speakers ) , plains cree ( about 100 speakers ) , crow ( about 3,000 speakers ) , dakota ( about 18,800 speakers in minnesota , montana , nebraska , north dakota , and south dakota ) , german hutterite ( about 5,600 speakers ) , gros ventre ( about 10 speakers ) , kalispel-pend d 'oreille ( about 64 speakers ) , kutenai ( about 6 speakers ) , and lakota ( about 6,000 speakers in minnesota , montana , nebraska , north dakota , south dakota ) . the united states department of education estimated in 2009 that 5,274 students in montana spoke a language at home other than english . these included a native american language ( 64 percent ) , german ( 4 percent ) , spanish ( 3 percent ) , russian ( 1 percent ) , and chinese ( less than 0.5 percent ) .
greek cypriots and turkish cypriots share a lot in common in their culture but also have differences . several traditional food ( such as souvla and halloumi ) and beverages are similar , as well as expressions and ways of life . hospitality and buying or offering food and drinks for guests or others are common among both . in both communities , music , dance and art are integral parts of social life and many artistic , verbal and nonverbal expressions , traditional dances such as tsifteteli , similarities in dance costumes and importance placed on social activities are shared between the communities . however , the two communities have distinct religions and religious cultures , with the greek cypriots traditionally being greek orthodox and turkish cypriots traditionally being sunni muslims , which has partly hindered cultural exchange . greek cypriots have influences from greece and christianity , while turkish cypriots have influences from turkey and islam .
the laurentian highlands , the interior plains and the interior highlands lie between the two coasts , stretching from the gulf of mexico northward , far beyond the national boundary , to the arctic ocean . the central plains are divided by a hardly perceptible height of land into a canadian and a united states portion . it is from the united states side , that the great mississippi system discharges southward to the gulf of mexico . the upper mississippi and some of the ohio basin is the semi-arid prairie region , with trees originally only along the watercourses . the uplands towards the appalachians were included in the great eastern forested area , while the western part of the plains has so dry a climate that its native plant life is scanty , and in the south it is practically barren .
puberty occurs through a long process and begins with a surge in hormone production , which in turn causes a number of physical changes . it is the stage of life characterized by the appearance and development of secondary sex characteristics ( for example , a deeper voice and larger adam 's apple in boys , and development of breasts and more curved and prominent hips in girls ) and a strong shift in hormonal balance towards an adult state . this is triggered by the pituitary gland , which secretes a surge of hormonal agents into the blood stream , initiating a chain reaction to occur . the male and female gonads are subsequently activated , which puts them into a state of rapid growth and development ; the triggered gonads now commence the mass production of the necessary chemicals . the testes primarily release testosterone , and the ovaries predominantly dispense estrogen . the production of these hormones increases gradually until sexual maturation is met . some boys may develop gynecomastia due to an imbalance of sex hormones , tissue responsiveness or obesity .
two polish friends in paris were also to play important roles in chopin 's life there . his fellow student at the warsaw conservatory , julian fontana , had originally tried unsuccessfully to establish himself in england ; albert grzymała , who in paris became a wealthy financier and society figure , often acted as chopin 's adviser and " gradually began to fill the role of elder brother in [ his ] life . " fontana was to become , in the words of michałowski and samson , chopin 's " general factotum and copyist . "
with his health further deteriorating , chopin desired to have a family member with him . in june 1849 his sister ludwika came to paris with her husband and daughter , and in september , supported by a loan from jane stirling , he took an apartment at place vendome 12 . after 15 october , when his condition took a marked turn for the worse , only a handful of his closest friends remained with him , although viardot remarked sardonically that " all the grand parisian ladies considered it de rigueur to faint in his room . "
domestication of sheep and goats reached egypt from the near east possibly as early as 6,000 bc . graeme barker states " the first indisputable evidence for domestic plants and animals in the nile valley is not until the early fifth millennium bc in northern egypt and a thousand years later further south , in both cases as part of strategies that still relied heavily on fishing , hunting , and the gathering of wild plants " and suggests that these subsistence changes were not due to farmers migrating from the near east but was an indigenous development , with cereals either indigenous or obtained through exchange . other scholars argue that the primary stimulus for agriculture and domesticated animals ( as well as mud-brick architecture and other neolithic cultural features ) in egypt was from the middle east .
in agriculture and animal husbandry , the green revolution popularized the use of conventional hybridization to increase yield . often hybridized breeds originated in developed countries and were further hybridized with local varieties in the developing world to create high yield strains resistant to local climate and diseases . local governments and industry have been pushing hybridization . formerly huge gene pools of various wild and indigenous breeds have collapsed causing widespread genetic erosion and genetic pollution . this has resulted in loss of genetic diversity and biodiversity as a whole .
the armenian highland lies in the highlands surrounding mount ararat , the highest peak of the region . in the bronze age , several states flourished in the area of greater armenia , including the hittite empire ( at the height of its power ) , mitanni ( south-western historical armenia ) , and hayasa-azzi ( 1600-1200 bc ) . soon after hayasa-azzi were arme-shupria ( 1300s-1190 bc ) , the nairi ( 1400-1000 bc ) and the kingdom of urartu ( 860-590 bc ) , who successively established their sovereignty over the armenian highland . each of the aforementioned nations and tribes participated in the ethnogenesis of the armenian people . under ashurbanipal ( 669-627 bc ) , the assyrian empire reached the caucasus mountains ( modern armenia , georgia and azerbaijan ) .
on december 30 , 1922 , the first congress of the soviets of the ussr approved the treaty on the creation of the ussr , by which russia was united with the ukrainian soviet socialist republic , byelorussian soviet socialist republic , and transcaucasian soviet federal socialist republic into a single federal state , the soviet union . later treaty was included in the 1924 soviet constitution , [ clarification needed ] adopted on january 31 , 1924 by the second congress of soviets of the ussr .
for the past 25 years , the tucson folk festival has taken place the first saturday and sunday of may in downtown tucson 's el presidio park . in addition to nationally known headline acts each evening , the festival highlights over 100 local and regional musicians on five stages is one of the largest free festivals in the country . all stages are within easy walking distance . organized by the tucson kitchen musicians association , volunteers make this festival possible . kxci 91.3-fm , arizona 's only community radio station , is a major partner , broadcasting from the plaza stage throughout the weekend . in addition , there are numerous workshops , events for children , sing-alongs , and a popular singer / songwriter contest . musicians typically play 30-minute sets , supported by professional audio staff volunteers . a variety of food and crafts are available at the festival , as well as local micro-brews . all proceeds from sales go to fund future festivals .
within the context of the overall murder rate , the death penalty cannot be said to be widely or routinely used in the united states ; in recent years the average has been about one execution for about every 700 murders committed , or 1 execution for about every 325 murder convictions . however , 32 of the 50 states still execute people . among them , alabama has the highest per capita rate of death sentences . this is due to judges overriding life imprisonment sentences and imposing the death penalty . no other states allow this .
new delhi is home to several historic sites and museums . the national museum which began with an exhibition of indian art and artefacts at the royal academy in london in the winter of 1947-48 was later at the end was shown at the rashtrapati bhawan in 1949 . later it was to form a permanent national museum . on 15 august 1949 , the national museum was formally inaugurated and currently has 200,000 works of art , both of indian and foreign origin , covering over 5,000 years .
on the shores of the strait , in 1701 , the french officer antoine de la mothe cadillac , along with fifty-one french people and french canadians , founded a settlement called fort pontchartrain du detroit , naming it after louis phelypeaux , comte de pontchartrain , minister of marine under louis xiv . france offered free land to colonists to attract families to detroit ; when it reached a total population of 800 in 1765 , it was the largest city between montreal and new orleans , both also french settlements . by 1773 , the population of detroit was 1,400 . by 1778 , its population was up to 2,144 and it was the third-largest city in the province of quebec .
in other cases , such as new zealand and canada , treaties allowed native peoples to maintain a minimum amount of autonomy . in the case of indigenous australians , unlike with the maori of new zealand , no treaty was ever entered into with the indigenous peoples entitling the europeans to land ownership , under the doctrine of terra nullius ( later overturned by mabo v queensland , establishing the concept of native title well after colonization was already a fait accompli ) . such treaties between colonizers and indigenous peoples are an important part of political discourse in the late 20th and early 21st century , the treaties being discussed have international standing as has been stated in a treaty study by the un .
the most pelagic species , mainly in the ' tubenose ' order procellariiformes , are great wanderers , and the albatrosses of the southern oceans may circle the globe as they ride the " roaring forties " outside the breeding season . the tubenoses spread widely over large areas of open ocean , but congregate when food becomes available . many are also among the longest-distance migrants ; sooty shearwaters puffinus griseus nesting on the falkland islands migrate 14,000 km ( 8,700 mi ) between the breeding colony and the north atlantic ocean off norway . some manx shearwaters puffinus puffinus do this same journey in reverse . as they are long-lived birds , they may cover enormous distances during their lives ; one record-breaking manx shearwater is calculated to have flown 8 million km ( 5 million miles ) during its over-50 year lifespan .
in 1871 , after the end of the war , the city was annexed to the newly established german empire as part of the reichsland elsass-lothringen under the terms of the treaty of frankfurt . as part of imperial germany , strasbourg was rebuilt and developed on a grand and representative scale , such as the neue stadt , or " new city " around the present place de la republique . historian rodolphe reuss and art historian wilhelm von bode were in charge of rebuilding the municipal archives , libraries and museums . the university , founded in 1567 and suppressed during the french revolution as a stronghold of german sentiment , [ citation needed ] was reopened in 1872 under the name kaiser-wilhelms-universitat .
african presbyterian churches often incorporate diaconal ministries , including social services , emergency relief , and the operation of mission hospitals . a number of partnerships exist between presbyteries in africa and the pc ( usa ) , including specific connections with lesotho , malawi , south africa , ghana and zambia . for example , the lackawanna presbytery , located in northeastern pennsylvania , has a partnership with a presbytery in ghana . also the southminster presbyterian church , located near pittsburgh , has partnerships with churches in malawi and kenya . the presbyterian church of nigeria , western africa is also healthy and strong in mostly the southern states of this nation , strong density in the south-eastern states of this country . beginning from cross river state , the nearby coastal states , rivers state , lagos state to ebonyi and abia states . the missionary expedition of mary slessor and hope waddel and their group in the mid 18th century in this coastal regions of the ten british colony has brought about the beginning and the flourishing of this church in these areas .
an unexpected adverse effect of daylight saving time may lie in the fact that an extra part of morning rush hour traffic occurs before dawn and traffic emissions then cause higher air pollution than during daylight hours .
qing china reached its largest extent during the 18th century , when it ruled china proper ( eighteen provinces ) as well as the areas of present-day northeast china , inner mongolia , outer mongolia , xinjiang and tibet , at approximately 13 million km2 in size . there were originally 18 provinces , all of which in china proper , but later this number was increased to 22 , with manchuria and xinjiang being divided or turned into provinces . taiwan , originally part of fujian province , became a province of its own in the late 19th century , but was ceded to the empire of japan in 1895 following the first sino-japanese war . in addition , many surrounding countries , such as korea ( joseon dynasty ) , vietnam frequently paid tribute to china during much of this period . khanate of kokand were forced to submit as protectorate and pay tribute to the qing dynasty in china between 1774 and 1798 .
the standing wave forms with this desired pattern at the design frequency , f0 , and antennas are normally designed to be this size . however , feeding that element with 3f0 ( whose wavelength is 1 ⁄ 3 that of f0 ) will also lead to a standing wave pattern . thus , an antenna element is also resonant when its length is 3 ⁄ 4 of a wavelength . this is true for all odd multiples of 1 ⁄ 4 wavelength . this allows some flexibility of design in terms of antenna lengths and feed points . antennas used in such a fashion are known to be harmonically operated .
the thermionic triode , a vacuum tube invented in 1907 , enabled amplified radio technology and long-distance telephony . the triode , however , was a fragile device that consumed a lot of power . physicist julius edgar lilienfeld filed a patent for a field-effect transistor ( fet ) in canada in 1925 , which was intended to be a solid-state replacement for the triode . lilienfeld also filed identical patents in the united states in 1926 and 1928 . however , lilienfeld did not publish any research articles about his devices nor did his patents cite any specific examples of a working prototype . because the production of high-quality semiconductor materials was still decades away , lilienfeld 's solid-state amplifier ideas would not have found practical use in the 1920s and 1930s , even if such a device had been built . in 1934 , german inventor oskar heil patented a similar device .
in 1980 half of all the industrial jobs in mexico were located in mexico city . under relentless growth , the mexico city government could barely keep up with services . villagers from the countryside who continued to pour into the city to escape poverty only compounded the city 's problems . with no housing available , they took over lands surrounding the city , creating huge shantytowns that extended for many miles . this caused serious air pollution in mexico city and water pollution problems , as well as subsidence due to overextraction of groundwater . air and water pollution has been contained and improved in several areas due to government programs , the renovation of vehicles and the modernization of public transportation .
the main passenger airport serving the metropolis and the state is melbourne airport ( also called tullamarine airport ) , which is the second busiest in australia , and the port of melbourne is australia 's busiest seaport for containerised and general cargo . melbourne has an extensive transport network . the main metropolitan train terminus is flinders street station , and the main regional train and coach terminus is southern cross station . melbourne is also home to australia 's most extensive freeway network and has the world 's largest urban tram network .
another landmark is the old centre and the canal structure in the inner city . the oudegracht is a curved canal , partly following the ancient main branch of the rhine . it is lined with the unique wharf-basement structures that create a two-level street along the canals . the inner city has largely retained its medieval structure , and the moat ringing the old town is largely intact . because of the role of utrecht as a fortified city , construction outside the medieval centre and its city walls was restricted until the 19th century . surrounding the medieval core there is a ring of late 19th- and early 20th-century neighbourhoods , with newer neighbourhoods positioned farther out . the eastern part of utrecht remains fairly open . the dutch water line , moved east of the city in the early 19th century required open lines of fire , thus prohibiting all permanent constructions until the middle of the 20th century on the east side of the city .
in june 1973 , gaddafi created a political ideology as a basis for the popular revolution . third international theory considered the u.s. and the soviet union as imperialist , thus rejected western capitalism as well as eastern bloc communism 's atheism . in this respect it was similar to the three worlds theory developed by china 's political leader mao zedong . as part of this theory , gaddafi praised nationalism as a progressive force and advocated the creation of a pan-arab state which would lead the islamic and third worlds against imperialism .
in the united states , non-caucasian lgbt individuals may find themselves in a double minority , where they are neither fully accepted or understood by mainly caucasian lgbt communities , nor are they accepted by their own ethnic group . many people experience racism in the dominant lgbt community where racial stereotypes merge with gender stereotypes , such that asian-american lgbts are viewed as more passive and feminine , while african-american lgbts are viewed as more masculine and aggressive . there are a number of culturally specific support networks for lgbt individuals active in the united states . for example , " o-moi " for vietnamese american queer females .
based on the similar shifts underway the nation 's economy after 1960 , philadelphia experienced a loss of manufacturing companies and jobs to lower taxed regions of the usa and often overseas . as a result , the economic base of philadelphia , which had historically been manufacturing , declined significantly . in addition , consolidation in several american industries ( retailing , financial services and health care in particular ) reduced the number of companies headquartered in philadelphia . the economic impact of these changes would reduce philadelphia 's tax base and the resources of local government . philadelphia struggled through a long period of adjustment to these economic changes , coupled with significant demographic change as wealthier residents moved into the nearby suburbs and more immigrants moved into the city . the city in fact approached bankruptcy in the late 1980s . revitalization began in the 1990s , with gentrification turning around many neighborhoods and reversing its decades-long trend of population loss .
the pointed arch , one of the defining attributes of gothic , was earlier incorporated into islamic architecture following the islamic conquests of roman syria and the sassanid empire in the seventh century . the pointed arch and its precursors had been employed in late roman and sassanian architecture ; within the roman context , evidenced in early church building in syria and occasional secular structures , like the roman karamagara bridge ; in sassanid architecture , in the parabolic and pointed arches employed in palace and sacred construction .
as with the spoken languages , the ethnic group composition also remains a point of debate , mainly regarding the largest and second largest ethnic groups , the persians and azerbaijanis , due to the lack of iranian state censuses based on ethnicity . the cia 's world factbook has estimated that around 79 % of the population of iran are a diverse indo-european ethno-linguistic group that comprise the speakers of iranian languages , with persians constituting 53 % of the population , gilaks and mazanderanis 7 % , kurds 10 % , lurs 6 % , and balochs 2 % . peoples of the other ethnicities in iran make up the remaining 22 % , with azerbaijanis constituting 16 % , arabs 2 % , turkmens and turkic tribes 2 % , and others 2 % ( such as armenians , talysh , georgians , circassians , assyrians ) .
stars , planets , and moons keep their atmospheres by gravitational attraction , and as such , atmospheres have no clearly delineated boundary : the density of atmospheric gas simply decreases with distance from the object . the earth 's atmospheric pressure drops to about 6998320000000000000 ♠ 3.2 × 10 − 2 pa at 100 kilometres ( 62 mi ) of altitude , the karman line , which is a common definition of the boundary with outer space . beyond this line , isotropic gas pressure rapidly becomes insignificant when compared to radiation pressure from the sun and the dynamic pressure of the solar winds , so the definition of pressure becomes difficult to interpret . the thermosphere in this range has large gradients of pressure , temperature and composition , and varies greatly due to space weather . astrophysicists prefer to use number density to describe these environments , in units of particles per cubic centimetre .
the banks in effect borrow cash and must pay it back ; the short durations allow interest rates to be adjusted continually . when the repo notes come due the participating banks bid again . an increase in the quantity of notes offered at auction allows an increase in liquidity in the economy . a decrease has the contrary effect . the contracts are carried on the asset side of the european central bank 's balance sheet and the resulting deposits in member banks are carried as a liability . in layman terms , the liability of the central bank is money , and an increase in deposits in member banks , carried as a liability by the central bank , means that more money has been put into the economy .

wpxd channel 31 , an affiliate of the ion television network , is licensed to the city . whtv channel 18 , a mynetworktv-affiliated station for the lansing market , broadcasts from a transmitter in lyndon township , west of ann arbor . community television network ( ctn ) is a city-provided cable television channel with production facilities open to city residents and nonprofit organizations . detroit and toledo-area radio and television stations also serve ann arbor , and stations from lansing and windsor , ontario , can be heard in parts of the area .
early research into circadian rhythms suggested that most people preferred a day closer to 25 hours when isolated from external stimuli like daylight and timekeeping . however , this research was faulty because it failed to shield the participants from artificial light . although subjects were shielded from time cues ( like clocks ) and daylight , the researchers were not aware of the phase-delaying effects of indoor electric lights . [ dubious - discuss ] the subjects were allowed to turn on light when they were awake and to turn it off when they wanted to sleep . electric light in the evening delayed their circadian phase . [ citation needed ] a more stringent study conducted in 1999 by harvard university estimated the natural human rhythm to be closer to 24 hours , 11 minutes : much closer to the solar day but still not perfectly in sync .
both the qing viceroy and the taiping king resided in buildings that would later be known as the presidential palace . when qing forces led by zeng guofan retook the city in 1864 , a massive slaughter occurred in the city with over 100,000 estimated to have committed suicide or fought to the death . since the taiping rebellion began , qing forces allowed no rebels speaking its dialect to surrender . this policy of mass murder of civilians occurred in nanjing .
islam arrived 1,400 years ago in zhejiang . today islam is practiced by a small number of people including virtually all the hui chinese living in zhejiang . another religion present in the province is she shamanism ( practiced by she ethnic minority ) .
in the united states , august vollmer introduced other reforms , including education requirements for police officers . o.w. wilson , a student of vollmer , helped reduce corruption and introduce professionalism in wichita , kansas , and later in the chicago police department . strategies employed by o.w. wilson included rotating officers from community to community to reduce their vulnerability to corruption , establishing of a non-partisan police board to help govern the police force , a strict merit system for promotions within the department , and an aggressive recruiting drive with higher police salaries to attract professionally qualified officers . during the professionalism era of policing , law enforcement agencies concentrated on dealing with felonies and other serious crime , rather than broader focus on crime prevention .
mach argued that , in effect , the water experiment in an otherwise empty universe would remain flat . but if another object were introduced into this universe , perhaps a distant star , there would now be something relative to which the bucket could be seen as rotating . the water inside the bucket could possibly have a slight curve . to account for the curve that we observe , an increase in the number of objects in the universe also increases the curvature in the water . mach argued that the momentum of an object , whether angular or linear , exists as a result of the sum of the effects of other objects in the universe ( mach 's principle ) .
southampton 's largest retail centre , and 35th largest in the uk , is the westquay shopping centre , which opened in september 2000 and hosts major high street stores including john lewis and marks and spencer . the centre was phase two of the west quay development of the former pirelli undersea cables factory ; the first phase of this was the west quay retail park , while the third phase ( watermark westquay ) was put on hold due to the recession . work is has resumed in 2015 , with plans for this third stage including shops , housing , an hotel and a public piazza alongside the town walls on western esplanade . southampton has also been granted a licence for a large casino . a further part of the redevelopment of the west quay site resulted in a new store , opened on 12 february 2009 , for swedish home products retailer ikea . marlands is a smaller shopping centre , built in the 1990s and located close to the northern side of westquay . southampton currently has two disused shopping centres : the 1970s eaststreet mall , and the 1980s bargate centre . neither of these were ever commercially successful ; the former has been earmarked for redevelopment as a morrison 's supermarket , while the future of the latter is uncertain . there is also the east street area which has been designated for speciality shopping , with the aim of promoting smaller retailers , alongside the chain store debenhams . in 2007 , southampton was ranked 13th for shopping in the uk .
american idol is an american singing competition series created by simon fuller and produced by 19 entertainment , and is distributed by fremantlemedia north america . it began airing on fox on june 11 , 2002 , as an addition to the idols format based on the british series pop idol and has since become one of the most successful shows in the history of american television . the concept of the series is to find new solo recording artists , with the winner being determined by the viewers in america . winners chosen by viewers through telephone , internet , and sms text voting were kelly clarkson , ruben studdard , fantasia barrino , carrie underwood , taylor hicks , jordin sparks , david cook , kris allen , lee dewyze , scotty mccreery , phillip phillips , candice glover , caleb johnson , and nick fradiani .
in mark 15 : 25 crucifixion takes place at the third hour ( 9 a.m. ) and jesus ' death at the ninth hour ( 3 p.m. ) . however , in john 19 : 14 jesus is still before pilate at the sixth hour . scholars have presented a number of arguments to deal with the issue , some suggesting a reconciliation , e.g. , based on the use of roman timekeeping in john but not in mark , yet others have rejected the arguments . several notable scholars have argued that the modern precision of marking the time of day should not be read back into the gospel accounts , written at a time when no standardization of timepieces , or exact recording of hours and minutes was available , and time was often approximated to the closest three-hour period .
during the 1960s , the ceremony of assenting by commission was discontinued and is now only employed once a year , at the end of the annual parliamentary session . in 1960 , the gentleman usher of the black rod arrived to summon the house of commons during a heated debate and several members protested against the disruption by refusing to attend the ceremony . the debacle was repeated in 1965 ; this time , when the speaker left the chair to go to the house of lords , some members continued to make speeches . as a result , the royal assent act 1967 was passed , creating an additional form for the granting of royal assent . as the attorney-general explained , " there has been a good deal of resentment not only at the loss of parliamentary time that has been involved but at the breaking of the thread of a possibly eloquent speech and the disruption of a debate that may be caused . " the granting of assent by the monarch in person , or by commission , is still possible , but this third form is used on a day-to-day basis .
since the 1979 revolution , to overcome foreign embargoes , iran has developed its own military industry , produced its own tanks , armored personnel carriers , guided missiles , submarines , military vessels , guided missile destroyer , radar systems , helicopters and fighter planes . in recent years , official announcements have highlighted the development of weapons such as the hoot , kowsar , zelzal , fateh-110 , shahab-3 and sejjil missiles , and a variety of unmanned aerial vehicles ( uavs ) . the fajr-3 ( mirv ) is currently iran 's most advanced ballistic missile , it is a liquid fuel missile with an undisclosed range which was developed and produced domestically .
paris in its early history had only the seine and bievre rivers for water . from 1809 , the canal de l 'ourcq provided paris with water from less-polluted rivers to the north-east of the capital . from 1857 , the civil engineer eugene belgrand , under napoleon iii , oversaw the construction of a series of new aqueducts that brought water from locations all around the city to several reservoirs built atop the capital 's highest points of elevation . from then on , the new reservoir system became paris ' principal source of drinking water , and the remains of the old system , pumped into lower levels of the same reservoirs , were from then on used for the cleaning of paris ' streets . this system is still a major part of paris ' modern water-supply network . today paris has more than 2,400 km ( 1,491 mi ) of underground passageways dedicated to the evacuation of paris ' liquid wastes .
because of its relative isolation from other spanish-speaking areas over most of its 400-year existence , new mexico spanish , and in particular the spanish of northern new mexico and colorado has retained many elements of 16th- and 17th-century spanish and has developed its own vocabulary . in addition , it contains many words from nahuatl , the language spoken by the ancient aztecs of mexico . new mexican spanish also contains loan words from the pueblo languages of the upper rio grande valley , mexican-spanish words ( mexicanismos ) , and borrowings from english . grammatical changes include the loss of the second person verb form , changes in verb endings , particularly in the preterite , and partial merging of the second and third conjugations .
currents induced into this winding provide the rotor magnetic field . the shape of the rotor bars determines the speed-torque characteristics . at low speeds , the current induced in the squirrel cage is nearly at line frequency and tends to be in the outer parts of the rotor cage . as the motor accelerates , the slip frequency becomes lower , and more current is in the interior of the winding . by shaping the bars to change the resistance of the winding portions in the interior and outer parts of the cage , effectively a variable resistance is inserted in the rotor circuit . however , the majority of such motors have uniform bars .
in may 1948 , following the british withdrawal , king farouk sent the egyptian army into palestine , with nasser serving in the 6th infantry battalion . during the war , he wrote of the egyptian army 's unpreparedness , saying " our soldiers were dashed against fortifications . " nasser was deputy commander of the egyptian forces that secured the faluja pocket . on 12 july , he was lightly wounded in the fighting . by august , his brigade was surrounded by the israeli army . appeals for help from jordan 's arab legion went unheeded , but the brigade refused to surrender . negotiations between israel and egypt finally resulted in the ceding of faluja to israel . according to veteran journalist eric margolis , the defenders of faluja , " including young army officer gamal abdel nasser , became national heroes " for enduring israeli bombardment while isolated from their command .
nigeria is divided into thirty-six states and one federal capital territory , which are further sub-divided into 774 local government areas ( lgas ) . the plethora of states , of which there were only three at independence , reflect the country 's tumultuous history and the difficulties of managing such a heterogeneous national entity at all levels of government . in some contexts , the states are aggregated into six geopolitical zones : north west , north east , north central , south east , south south , and south west .
originally , the hardware architecture was so closely tied to the mac os operating system that it was impossible to boot an alternative operating system . the most common workaround , is to boot into mac os and then to hand over control to a mac os-based bootloader application . used even by apple for a / ux and mklinux , this technique is no longer necessary since the introduction of open firmware-based pci macs , though it was formerly used for convenience on many old world rom systems due to bugs in the firmware implementation . [ citation needed ] now , mac hardware boots directly from open firmware in most powerpc-based macs or efi in all intel-based macs .
suleiman the magnificent ( 1520-1566 ) captured belgrade in 1521 , conquered the southern and central parts of the kingdom of hungary as part of the ottoman-hungarian wars , [ not in citation given ] and , after his historical victory in the battle of mohacs in 1526 , he established turkish rule in the territory of present-day hungary ( except the western part ) and other central european territories . he then laid siege to vienna in 1529 , but failed to take the city . in 1532 , he made another attack on vienna , but was repulsed in the siege of guns . transylvania , wallachia and , intermittently , moldavia , became tributary principalities of the ottoman empire . in the east , the ottoman turks took baghdad from the persians in 1535 , gaining control of mesopotamia and naval access to the persian gulf . in 1555 , the caucasus became officially partitioned for the first time between the safavids and the ottomans , a status quo that would remain until the end of the russo-turkish war ( 1768-74 ) . by this partitioning of the caucasus as signed in the peace of amasya , western armenia , and western georgia fell into ottoman hands , while dagestan , eastern armenia , eastern georgia , and azerbaijan remained persian .
interstate 26 begins in downtown charleston , with exits to the septima clark expressway , the arthur ravenel , jr . bridge and meeting street . heading northwest , it connects the city to north charleston , the charleston international airport , interstate 95 , and columbia . the arthur ravenel , jr . bridge and septima clark expressway are part of u.s. highway 17 , which travels east-west through the cities of charleston and mount pleasant . the mark clark expressway , or interstate 526 , is the bypass around the city and begins and ends at u.s. highway 17 . u.s. highway 52 is meeting street and its spur is east bay street , which becomes morrison drive after leaving the east side . this highway merges with king street in the city 's neck area ( industrial district ) . u.s. highway 78 is king street in the downtown area , eventually merging with meeting street .
during the period of north-south division , nanjing remained the capital of the southern dynasties for more than two and a half centuries . during this time , nanjing was the international hub of east asia . based on historical documents , the city had 280,000 registered households . assuming an average nanjing household had about 5.1 people at that time , the city had more than 1.4 million residents .
several boutique and chain hotels have opened in recent years in the south bronx ; in addition , a la quinta inn that has been proposed for the mott haven waterfront . the kingsbridge armory , often cited as the largest armory in the world , is scheduled for redevelopment as the kingsbridge national ice center . under consideration for future development is the construction of a platform over the new york city subway 's concourse yard adjacent to lehman college . the construction would permit approximately 2,000,000 square feet ( 190,000 m2 ) of development and would cost us $ 350-500 million .
the 19th century also saw the use of red in art to create specific emotions , not just to imitate nature . it saw the systematic study of color theory , and particularly the study of how complementary colors such as red and green reinforced each other when they were placed next to each other . these studies were avidly followed by artists such as vincent van gogh . describing his painting , the night cafe , to his brother theo in 1888 , van gogh wrote : " i sought to express with red and green the terrible human passions . the hall is blood red and pale yellow , with a green billiard table in the center , and four lamps of lemon yellow , with rays of orange and green . everywhere it is a battle and antithesis of the most different reds and greens . "
the bank is based in frankfurt , the largest financial centre in the eurozone . its location in the city is fixed by the amsterdam treaty . the bank moved to new purpose-built headquarters in 2014 which were designed a vienna-based architectural office named coop himmelbau . the building is approximately 180 metres ( 591 ft ) tall and will be accompanied with other secondary buildings on a landscaped site on the site of the former wholesale market in the eastern part of frankfurt am main . the main construction began in october 2008 , and it was expected that the building will become an architectural symbol for europe . while it was designed to accommodate double the number of staff who operate in the former eurotower , that building has been retained since the ecb took responsibility for banking supervision and more space was hence required .
since the canons of criticism are highly susceptible to interpretation , and at times even contradict each other , they may be employed to justify a result that fits the textual critic 's aesthetic or theological agenda . starting in the 19th century , scholars sought more rigorous methods to guide editorial judgment . best-text editing ( a complete rejection of eclecticism ) became one extreme . stemmatics and copy-text editing - while both eclectic , in that they permit the editor to select readings from multiple sources - sought to reduce subjectivity by establishing one or a few witnesses presumably as being favored by " objective " criteria . [ citation needed ] the citing of sources used , and alternate readings , and the use of original text and images helps readers and other critics determine to an extent the depth of research of the critic , and to independently verify their work .
the formula defining the hdi is promulgated by the united nations development programme ( undp ) . in general , to transform a raw variable , say , into a unit-free index between 0 and 1 ( which allows different indices to be added together ) , the following formula is used :
three other efforts to improve regulation of international pesticide trade are the united nations london guidelines for the exchange of information on chemicals in international trade and the united nations codex alimentarius commission . [ citation needed ] the former seeks to implement procedures for ensuring that prior informed consent exists between countries buying and selling pesticides , while the latter seeks to create uniform standards for maximum levels of pesticide residues among participating countries . both initiatives operate on a voluntary basis .
in season eight , latin grammy award-nominated singer-songwriter and record producer kara dioguardi was added as a fourth judge . she stayed for two seasons and left the show before season ten . paula abdul left the show before season nine after failing to agree terms with the show producers . emmy award-winning talk show host ellen degeneres replaced paula abdul for that season , but left after just one season . on january 11 , 2010 , simon cowell announced that he was leaving the show to pursue introducing the american version of his show the x factor to the usa for 2011 . jennifer lopez and steven tyler joined the judging panel in season ten , but both left after two seasons . they were replaced by three new judges , mariah carey , nicki minaj and keith urban , who joined randy jackson in season 12 . however both carey and minaj left after one season , and randy jackson also announced that he would depart the show after twelve seasons as a judge but would return as a mentor . urban is the only judge from season 12 to return in season 13 . he was joined by previous judge jennifer lopez and former mentor harry connick , jr .. lopez , urban and connick , jr. all returned as judges for the show 's fourteenth and fifteenth seasons .
the first sky television rights agreement was worth £ 304 million over five seasons . the next contract , negotiated to start from the 1997-98 season , rose to £ 670 million over four seasons . the third contract was a £ 1.024 billion deal with bskyb for the three seasons from 2001-02 to 2003-04 . the league brought in £ 320 million from the sale of its international rights for the three-year period from 2004-05 to 2006-07 . it sold the rights itself on a territory-by-territory basis . sky 's monopoly was broken from august 2006 when setanta sports was awarded rights to show two out of the six packages of matches available . this occurred following an insistence by the european commission that exclusive rights should not be sold to one television company . sky and setanta paid a total of £ 1.7 billion , a two-thirds increase which took many commentators by surprise as it had been widely assumed that the value of the rights had levelled off following many years of rapid growth . setanta also hold rights to a live 3 pm match solely for irish viewers . the bbc has retained the rights to show highlights for the same three seasons ( on match of the day ) for £ 171.6 million , a 63 per cent increase on the £ 105 million it paid for the previous three-year period . sky and bt have agreed to jointly pay £ 84.3 million for delayed television rights to 242 games ( that is the right to broadcast them in full on television and over the internet ) in most cases for a period of 50 hours after 10 pm on matchday . overseas television rights fetched £ 625 million , nearly double the previous contract . the total raised from these deals is more than £ 2.7 billion , giving premier league clubs an average media income from league games of around £ 40 million-a-year from 2007 to 2010 .
in 1654 , otto von guericke invented the first vacuum pump and conducted his famous magdeburg hemispheres experiment , showing that teams of horses could not separate two hemispheres from which the air had been partially evacuated . robert boyle improved guericke 's design and with the help of robert hooke further developed vacuum pump technology . thereafter , research into the partial vacuum lapsed until 1850 when august toepler invented the toepler pump and heinrich geissler invented the mercury displacement pump in 1855 , achieving a partial vacuum of about 10 pa ( 0.1 torr ) . a number of electrical properties become observable at this vacuum level , which renewed interest in further research .
hayek never produced the book-length treatment of " the dynamics of capital " that he had promised in the pure theory of capital . after 1941 , he continued to publish works on the economics of information , political philosophy , the theory of law , and psychology , but seldom on macroeconomics . at the university of chicago , hayek was not part of the economics department and did not influence the rebirth of neoclassical theory which took place there ( see chicago school of economics ) . when , in 1974 , he shared the nobel memorial prize in economics with gunnar myrdal , the latter complained about being paired with an " ideologue . " milton friedman declared himself " an enormous admirer of hayek , but not for his economics . i think prices and production is a very flawed book . i think his [ pure theory of capital ] is unreadable . on the other hand , the road to serfdom is one of the great books of our time . "
beyonce further expanded her acting career , starring as blues singer etta james in the 2008 musical biopic , cadillac records . her performance in the film received praise from critics , and she garnered several nominations for her portrayal of james , including a satellite award nomination for best supporting actress , and a naacp image award nomination for outstanding supporting actress . beyonce donated her entire salary from the film to phoenix house , an organization of rehabilitation centers for heroin addicts around the country . on january 20 , 2009 , beyonce performed james ' " at last " at the first couple 's first inaugural ball . beyonce starred opposite ali larter and idris elba in the thriller , obsessed . she played sharon charles , a mother and wife who learns of a woman 's obsessive behavior over her husband . although the film received negative reviews from critics , the movie did well at the us box office , grossing $ 68 million - $ 60 million more than cadillac records - on a budget of $ 20 million . the fight scene finale between sharon and the character played by ali larter also won the 2010 mtv movie award for best fight .
israeli cuisine includes local dishes as well as dishes brought to the country by jewish immigrants from the diaspora . since the establishment of the state in 1948 , and particularly since the late 1970s , an israeli fusion cuisine has developed . roughly half of the israeli-jewish population attests to keeping kosher at home . kosher restaurants , though rare in the 1960s , make up around 25 % of the total as of 2015 [ update ] , perhaps reflecting the largely secular values of those who dine out . hotel restaurants are much more likely to serve kosher food . the non-kosher retail market was traditionally sparse , but grew rapidly and considerably following the influx of immigrants from eastern europe and russia during the 1990s . together with non-kosher fish , rabbits and ostriches , pork - often called " white meat " in israel - is produced and consumed , though it is forbidden by both judaism and islam .
madonna 's italian-catholic background and her relationship with her parents are reflected in the album like a prayer . it was an evocation of the impact religion had on her career . her video for the title track contains catholic symbolism , such as the stigmata . during the virgin tour , she wore a rosary and prayed with it in the music video for " la isla bonita . " the " open your heart " video sees her boss scolding her in the italian language . on the who 's that girl world tour , she dedicated the song " papa don 't preach " to pope john paul ii .
compass-m1 transmits in 3 bands : e2 , e5b , and e6 . in each frequency band two coherent sub-signals have been detected with a phase shift of 90 degrees ( in quadrature ) . these signal components are further referred to as " i " and " q. " the " i " components have shorter codes and are likely to be intended for the open service . the " q " components have much longer codes , are more interference resistive , and are probably intended for the restricted service . iq modulation has been the method in both wired and wireless digital modulation since morsetting carrier signal 100 years ago .
the critic joseph bedier ( 1864-1938 ) launched a particularly withering attack on stemmatics in 1928 . he surveyed editions of medieval french texts that were produced with the stemmatic method , and found that textual critics tended overwhelmingly to produce trees divided into just two branches . he concluded that this outcome was unlikely to have occurred by chance , and that therefore , the method was tending to produce bipartite stemmas regardless of the actual history of the witnesses . he suspected that editors tended to favor trees with two branches , as this would maximize the opportunities for editorial judgment ( as there would be no third branch to " break the tie " whenever the witnesses disagreed ) . he also noted that , for many works , more than one reasonable stemma could be postulated , suggesting that the method was not as rigorous or as scientific as its proponents had claimed .
the traditional greek homelands have been the greek peninsula and the aegean sea , the southern italy ( magna graecia ) , the black sea , the ionian coasts of asia minor and the islands of cyprus and sicily . in plato 's phaidon , socrates remarks , " we ( greeks ) live around a sea like frogs around a pond " when describing to his friends the greek cities of the aegean . this image is attested by the map of the old greek diaspora , which corresponded to the greek world until the creation of the greek state in 1832 . the sea and trade were natural outlets for greeks since the greek peninsula is rocky and does not offer good prospects for agriculture .
the 1973 oil embargo and 1979 energy crisis caused a reorganization of energy policies around the world and brought renewed attention to developing solar technologies . deployment strategies focused on incentive programs such as the federal photovoltaic utilization program in the us and the sunshine program in japan . other efforts included the formation of research facilities in the us ( seri , now nrel ) , japan ( nedo ) , and germany ( fraunhofer institute for solar energy systems ise ) .
on 11 june 2009 , four uyghurs who had been held in the united states guantanamo bay detention camp , in cuba , were transferred to bermuda . the four men were among 22 uyghurs who claimed to be refugees , who were captured in 2001 in pakistan after fleeing the american aerial bombardment of afghanistan . they were accused of training to assist the taliban 's military . they were cleared as safe for release from guantanamo in 2005 or 2006 , but us domestic law prohibited deporting them back to china , their country of citizenship , because the us government determined that china was likely to violate their human rights .
in the case of the united states where a one-hour shift occurs at 02 : 00 local time , in spring the clock jumps forward from the last moment of 01 : 59 standard time to 03 : 00 dst and that day has 23 hours , whereas in autumn the clock jumps backward from the last moment of 01 : 59 dst to 01 : 00 standard time , repeating that hour , and that day has 25 hours . a digital display of local time does not read 02 : 00 exactly at the shift to summer time , but instead jumps from 01 : 59 : 59.9 forward to 03 : 00 : 00.0 .
in january 1917 , the watch tower society 's legal representative , joseph franklin rutherford , was elected as its next president . his election was disputed , and members of the board of directors accused him of acting in an autocratic and secretive manner . the divisions between his supporters and opponents triggered a major turnover of members over the next decade . in june 1917 , he released the finished mystery as a seventh volume of russell 's studies in the scriptures series . the book , published as the posthumous work of russell , was a compilation of his commentaries on the bible books of ezekiel and revelation , plus numerous additions by bible students clayton woodworth and george fisher . it strongly criticized catholic and protestant clergy and christian involvement in the great war . as a result , watch tower society directors were jailed for sedition under the espionage act in 1918 and members were subjected to mob violence ; charges against the directors were dropped in 1920 .
most ingested uranium is excreted during digestion . only 0.5 % is absorbed when insoluble forms of uranium , such as its oxide , are ingested , whereas absorption of the more soluble uranyl ion can be up to 5 % . however , soluble uranium compounds tend to quickly pass through the body , whereas insoluble uranium compounds , especially when inhaled by way of dust into the lungs , pose a more serious exposure hazard . after entering the bloodstream , the absorbed uranium tends to bioaccumulate and stay for many years in bone tissue because of uranium 's affinity for phosphates . uranium is not absorbed through the skin , and alpha particles released by uranium cannot penetrate the skin .
the british - by inclination as well as for practical reasons - had tended to avoid large-scale commitments of troops on the continent . they sought to offset the disadvantage of this in europe by allying themselves with one or more continental powers whose interests were antithetical to those of their enemies , particularly france . : 15-16 by subsidising the armies of continental allies , britain could turn london 's enormous financial power to military advantage . in the seven years ' war , the british chose as their principal partner the greatest general of the day , frederick the great of prussia , then the rising power in central europe , and paid frederick substantial subsidies for his campaigns . : 106 this was accomplished in the diplomatic revolution of 1756 , in which britain ended its long-standing alliance with austria in favor of prussia , leaving austria to side with france . in marked contrast to france , britain strove to prosecute the war actively in the colonies , taking full advantage of its naval power . : 64-66 the british pursued a dual strategy - naval blockade and bombardment of enemy ports , and rapid movement of troops by sea . they harassed enemy shipping and attacked enemy colonies , frequently using colonists from nearby british colonies in the effort .
in texas , english is the state 's de facto official language ( though it lacks de jure status ) and is used in government . however , the continual influx of spanish-speaking immigrants increased the import of spanish in texas . texas 's counties bordering mexico are mostly hispanic , and consequently , spanish is commonly spoken in the region . the government of texas , through section 2054.116 of the government code , mandates that state agencies provide information on their websites in spanish to assist residents who have limited english proficiency .
many sanskrit dramas also indicate that the language coexisted with prakrits , spoken by multilingual speakers with a more extensive education . sanskrit speakers were almost always multilingual . in the medieval era , sanskrit continued to be spoken and written , particularly by learned brahmins for scholarly communication . this was a thin layer of indian society , but covered a wide geography . centres like varanasi , paithan , pune and kanchipuram had a strong presence of teaching and debating institutions , and high classical sanskrit was maintained until british times .
on august 23 , after the failure of gkchp , in the presence of gorbachev , yeltsin signed a decree suspending all activity by the communist party of the russian sfsr in the territory of russia . on november 6 , he went further , banning the communist parties of the ussr and the rsfsr from the territory of the rsfsr .
the rediscovery of aristotle 's works-more than 3000 pages of it would eventually be translated -fuelled a spirit of inquiry into natural processes that had already begun to emerge in the 12th century . some scholars believe that these works represented one of the most important document discoveries in western intellectual history . richard dales , for instance , calls the discovery of aristotle 's works " a turning point in the history of western thought . " after aristotle re-emerged , a community of scholars , primarily communicating in latin , accelerated the process and practice of attempting to reconcile the thoughts of greek antiquity , and especially ideas related to understanding the natural world , with those of the church . the efforts of this " scholasticism " were focused on applying aristotelian logic and thoughts about natural processes to biblical passages and attempting to prove the viability of those passages through reason . this became the primary mission of lecturers , and the expectation of students .
in early 2009 , spielberg shot the first film in a planned trilogy of motion capture films based on the adventures of tintin , written by belgian artist herge , with peter jackson . the adventures of tintin : the secret of the unicorn , was not released until october 2011 , due to the complexity of the computer animation involved . the world premiere took place on october 22 , 2011 in brussels , belgium . the film was released in north american theaters on december 21 , 2011 , in digital 3d and imax . it received generally positive reviews from critics , and grossed over $ 373 million worldwide . the adventures of tintin won the award for best animated feature film at the golden globe awards that year . it is the first non-pixar film to win the award since the category was first introduced . jackson has been announced to direct the second film .
the city planning commission , tasked with guiding growth and development of the city , has divided the city into 18 planning districts as part of the philadelphia2035 physical development plan . much of the city 's 1980 zoning code was overhauled from 2007-2012 as part of a joint effort between former mayors john f. street and michael nutter . the zoning changes were intended to rectify incorrect zoning mapping that would streamline future community preferences and development , which the city forecasts an additional 100,000 residents and 40,000 jobs to be added to philadelphia in 2035 .
the denomination with the longest history of objection to freemasonry is the roman catholic church . the objections raised by the roman catholic church are based on the allegation that masonry teaches a naturalistic deistic religion which is in conflict with church doctrine . a number of papal pronouncements have been issued against freemasonry . the first was pope clement xii 's in eminenti apostolatus , 28 april 1738 ; the most recent was pope leo xiii 's ab apostolici , 15 october 1890 . the 1917 code of canon law explicitly declared that joining freemasonry entailed automatic excommunication , and banned books favouring freemasonry .
sicily fell under the control of the holy roman empire in 1194 . palermo was the preferred city of the emperor frederick ii . muslims of palermo emigrated or were expelled during holy roman rule . after an interval of angevin rule ( 1266-1282 ) , sicily came under control of the aragon and barcelona dynasties . by 1330 , palermo 's population had declined to 51,000 . from 1479 until 1713 palermo was ruled by the kingdom of spain , and again between 1717 and 1718 . palermo was also under savoy control between 1713 and 1717 and 1718-1720 as a result of the treaty of utrecht . it was also ruled by austria between 1720 and 1734 .
the use of time is an important issue in understanding human behavior , education , and travel behavior . time-use research is a developing field of study . the question concerns how time is allocated across a number of activities ( such as time spent at home , at work , shopping , etc . ) . time use changes with technology , as the television or the internet created new opportunities to use time in different ways . however , some aspects of time use are relatively stable over long periods of time , such as the amount of time spent traveling to work , which despite major changes in transport , has been observed to be about 20-30 minutes one-way for a large number of cities over a long period .
in 1664 , peter stuyvesant , the director-general of the colony of new netherland , surrendered new amsterdam to the english without bloodshed . the english promptly renamed the fledgling city " new york " after the duke of york ( later king james ii ) .
greece has universal compulsory military service for males , while females are exempted from conscription but may otherwise serve in the military . as of 2009 [ update ] , mandatory military service is nine months for male citizens between the ages of 19 and 45 . additionally , greek males between the age of 18 and 60 who live in strategically sensitive areas may be required to serve part-time in the national guard . however , as the military has sought to become a completely professional force , the government has promised to reduce mandatory military service or abolish it completely .
several subsets of unicode are standardized : microsoft windows since windows nt 4.0 supports wgl-4 with 652 characters , which is considered to support all contemporary european languages using the latin , greek , or cyrillic script . other standardized subsets of unicode include the multilingual european subsets : mes-1 ( latin scripts only , 335 characters ) , mes-2 ( latin , greek and cyrillic 1062 characters ) and mes-3a & mes-3b ( two larger subsets , not shown here ) . note that mes-2 includes every character in mes-1 and wgl-4 .
the above " history of economics " reflects modern economic textbooks and this means that the last stage of a science is represented as the culmination of its history ( kuhn , 1962 ) . the " invisible hand " mentioned in a lost page in the middle of a chapter in the middle of the to " wealth of nations , " 1776 , advances as smith 's central message . [ clarification needed ] it is played down that this " invisible hand " acts only " frequently " and that it is " no part of his [ the individual 's ] intentions " because competition leads to lower prices by imitating " his " invention . that this " invisible hand " prefers " the support of domestic to foreign industry " is cleansed - often without indication that part of the citation is truncated . the opening passage of the " wealth " containing smith 's message is never mentioned as it cannot be integrated into modern theory : " wealth " depends on the division of labour which changes with market volume and on the proportion of productive to unproductive labor .
the reinforcement type defines two major classes of materials - woven and non-woven . woven reinforcements are cheaper , but the high dielectric constant of glass may not be favorable for many higher-frequency applications . the spatially nonhomogeneous structure also introduces local variations in electrical parameters , due to different resin / glass ratio at different areas of the weave pattern . nonwoven reinforcements , or materials with low or no reinforcement , are more expensive but more suitable for some rf / analog applications .
ann arbor has a typically midwestern humid continental climate ( koppen dfa ) , which is influenced by the great lakes . there are four distinct seasons : winters are cold with moderate to heavy snowfall , while summers are very warm and humid , and spring and autumn are short but mild . the area experiences lake effect weather , primarily in the form of increased cloudiness during late fall and early winter . the monthly daily average temperature in july is 72.6 ° f ( 22.6 ° c ) , while the same figure for january is 24.5 ° f ( − 4.2 ° c ) . temperatures reach or exceed 90 ° f ( 32 ° c ) on 10 days , and drop to or below 0 ° f ( − 18 ° c ) on 4.6 nights . precipitation tends to be the heaviest during the summer months , but most frequent during winter . snowfall , which normally occurs from november to april but occasionally starts in october , averages 58 inches ( 147 cm ) per season . the lowest recorded temperature was − 23 ° f ( − 31 ° c ) on 11 february 1885 and the highest recorded temperature was 105 ° f ( 41 ° c ) on 24 july 1934 .
mosaic has a long history , starting in mesopotamia in the 3rd millennium bc . pebble mosaics were made in tiryns in mycenean greece ; mosaics with patterns and pictures became widespread in classical times , both in ancient greece and ancient rome . early christian basilicas from the 4th century onwards were decorated with wall and ceiling mosaics . mosaic art flourished in the byzantine empire from the 6th to the 15th centuries ; that tradition was adopted by the norman kingdom in sicily in the 12th century , by eastern-influenced venice , and among the rus in ukraine . mosaic fell out of fashion in the renaissance , though artists like raphael continued to practise the old technique . roman and byzantine influence led jews to decorate 5th and 6th century synagogues in the middle east with floor mosaics .
pesticides can be classified based upon their biological mechanism function or application method . most pesticides work by poisoning pests . a systemic pesticide moves inside a plant following absorption by the plant . with insecticides and most fungicides , this movement is usually upward ( through the xylem ) and outward . increased efficiency may be a result . systemic insecticides , which poison pollen and nectar in the flowers [ citation needed ] , may kill bees and other needed pollinators [ citation needed ] .
the battle secured the beachheads of the u.s. sixth army on leyte against attack from the sea , broke the back of japanese naval power and opened the way for an advance to the ryukyu islands in 1945 . the only significant japanese naval operation afterwards was the disastrous operation ten-go in april 1945 . kurita 's force had begun the battle with five battleships ; when he returned to japan , only yamato was combat-worthy . nishimura 's sunken yamashiro was the last battleship in history to engage another in combat .
process theology typically stresses god 's relational nature . rather than seeing god as impassive or emotionless , process theologians view god as " the fellow sufferer who understands , " and as the being who is supremely affected by temporal events . hartshorne points out that people would not praise a human ruler who was unaffected by either the joys or sorrows of his followers - so why would this be a praise-worthy quality in god ? instead , as the being who is most affected by the world , god is the being who can most appropriately respond to the world . however , process theology has been formulated in a wide variety of ways . c. robert mesle , for instance , advocates a " process naturalism , " i.e. a process theology without god .
the most popular available tourist destinations in myanmar include big cities such as yangon and mandalay ; religious sites in mon state , pindaya , bago and hpa-an ; nature trails in inle lake , kengtung , putao , pyin oo lwin ; ancient cities such as bagan and mrauk-u ; as well as beaches in nabule , ngapali , ngwe-saung , mergui . nevertheless , much of the country is off-limits to tourists , and interactions between foreigners and the people of myanmar , particularly in the border regions , are subject to police scrutiny . they are not to discuss politics with foreigners , under penalty of imprisonment and , in 2001 , the myanmar tourism promotion board issued an order for local officials to protect tourists and limit " unnecessary contact " between foreigners and ordinary burmese people .
the required beliefs of these clauses include belief in a supreme being and belief in a future state of rewards and punishments . ( tennessee constitution article ix , section 2 is one such example . ) some of these same states specify that the oath of office include the words " so help me god . " in some cases these beliefs ( or oaths ) were historically required of jurors and witnesses in court . at one time , such restrictions were allowed under the doctrine of states ' rights ; today they are deemed to be in violation of the federal first amendment , as applied to the states via the 14th amendment , and hence unconstitutional and unenforceable .
the site of richmond had been an important village of the powhatan confederacy , and was briefly settled by english colonists from jamestown in 1609 , and in 1610-1611 . the present city of richmond was founded in 1737 . it became the capital of the colony and dominion of virginia in 1780 . during the revolutionary war period , several notable events occurred in the city , including patrick henry 's " give me liberty or give me death " speech in 1775 at st. john 's church , and the passage of the virginia statute for religious freedom written by thomas jefferson . during the american civil war , richmond served as the capital of the confederate states of america . the city entered the 20th century with one of the world 's first successful electric streetcar systems , as well as a national hub of african-american commerce and culture , the jackson ward neighborhood .
towards the end of the republic , religious and political offices became more closely intertwined ; the office of pontifex maximus became a de facto consular prerogative . augustus was personally vested with an extraordinary breadth of political , military and priestly powers ; at first temporarily , then for his lifetime . he acquired or was granted an unprecedented number of rome 's major priesthoods , including that of pontifex maximus ; as he invented none , he could claim them as traditional honours . his reforms were represented as adaptive , restorative and regulatory , rather than innovative ; most notably his elevation ( and membership ) of the ancient arvales , his timely promotion of the plebeian compitalia shortly before his election and his patronage of the vestals as a visible restoration of roman morality . augustus obtained the pax deorum , maintained it for the rest of his reign and adopted a successor to ensure its continuation . this remained a primary religious and social duty of emperors .
in 1996 , marvel had some of its titles participate in " heroes reborn , " a crossover that allowed marvel to relaunch some of its flagship characters such as the avengers and the fantastic four , and outsource them to the studios of two of the former marvel artists turned image comics founders , jim lee and rob liefeld . the relaunched titles , which saw the characters transported to a parallel universe with a history distinct from the mainstream marvel universe , were a solid success amidst a generally struggling industry , but marvel discontinued the experiment after a one-year run and returned the characters to the marvel universe proper . in 1998 , the company launched the imprint marvel knights , taking place within marvel continuity ; helmed by soon-to-become editor-in-chief joe quesada , it featured tough , gritty stories showcasing such characters as the inhumans , black panther and daredevil .
in consequence to the reform war , the federal government was bankrupt and could not pay its foreign debts to spain , england , and france . on july 17 , 1861 , president juarez decreed a moratorium on payment to foreign debtors for a period of two years . spain , england , and france did not accept the moratorium by mexico ; they united at the convention of the triple alliance on october 31 , 1861 in which they agreed to take possession of several custom stations within mexico as payment . a delegation of the triple alliance arrived in veracruz in december 1861 . president juarez immediately sent his foreign affairs minister , manuel doblado , who is able to reduce the debts through the pacto de soledad ( soledad pact ) . general juan prim of spain persuaded the english delegation to accept the terms of the pacto de soledad , but the french delegation refused .
near the end of the nes 's lifespan , upon the release of the av famicom and the top-loading nes 2 , the design of the game controllers was modified slightly . though the original button layout was retained , the redesigned device abandoned the brick shell in favor of a dog bone shape . in addition , the av famicom joined its international counterpart and dropped the hardwired controllers in favor of detachable controller ports . however , the controllers included with the famicom av had cables which were 90 cm ( 3 feet ) long , as opposed to the standard 180 cm ( 6 feet ) of nes controllers .
madonna 's use of sexual imagery has benefited her career and catalyzed public discourse on sexuality and feminism . as roger chapman documents in culture wars : an encyclopedia of issues , viewpoints , and voices , volume 1 ( 2010 ) , she has drawn frequent condemnation from religious organizations , social conservatives and parental watchdog groups for her use of explicit , sexual imagery and lyrics , religious symbolism , and otherwise " irreverent " behavior in her live performances . the times wrote that she had " started a revolution amongst women in music ... her attitudes and opinions on sex , nudity , style and sexuality forced the public to sit up and take notice . " professor john fiske noted that the sense of empowerment that madonna offers is inextricably connected with the pleasure of exerting some control over the meanings of self , of sexuality , and of one 's social relations . in doing gender in media , art and culture ( 2009 ) , the authors noted that madonna , as a female celebrity , performer , and pop icon , is able to unsettle standing feminist reflections and debates . according to lesbian feminist sheila jeffreys , madonna represents woman 's occupancy of what monique wittig calls the category of sex , as powerful , and appears to gleefully embrace the performance of the sexual corvee allotted to women . professor sut jhally has referred to madonna as " an almost sacred feminist icon . "
boston is an intellectual , technological , and political center but has lost some important regional institutions , including the acquisition of the boston globe by the new york times , and the loss to mergers and acquisitions of local financial institutions such as fleetboston financial , which was acquired by charlotte-based bank of america in 2004 . boston-based department stores jordan marsh and filene 's have both been merged into the cincinnati-based macy 's . boston has experienced gentrification in the latter half of the 20th century , with housing prices increasing sharply since the 1990s . living expenses have risen , and boston has one of the highest costs of living in the united states , and was ranked the 129th most expensive major city in the world in a 2011 survey of 214 cities . despite cost of living issues , boston ranks high on livability ratings , ranking 36th worldwide in quality of living in 2011 in a survey of 221 major cities .
the labour party 's origins lie in the late 19th century , when it became apparent that there was a need for a new political party to represent the interests and needs of the urban proletariat , a demographic which had increased in number and had recently been given franchise . some members of the trades union movement became interested in moving into the political field , and after further extensions of the voting franchise in 1867 and 1885 , the liberal party endorsed some trade-union sponsored candidates . the first lib-lab candidate to stand was george odger in the southwark by-election of 1870 . in addition , several small socialist groups had formed around this time , with the intention of linking the movement to political policies . among these were the independent labour party , the intellectual and largely middle-class fabian society , the marxist social democratic federation and the scottish labour party .
audio data compression , not to be confused with dynamic range compression , has the potential to reduce the transmission bandwidth and storage requirements of audio data . audio compression algorithms are implemented in software as audio codecs . lossy audio compression algorithms provide higher compression at the cost of fidelity and are used in numerous audio applications . these algorithms almost all rely on psychoacoustics to eliminate less audible or meaningful sounds , thereby reducing the space required to store or transmit them .
research focusing on sexual orientation uses scales of assessment to identify who belongs in which sexual population group . it is assumed that these scales will be able to reliably identify and categorize people by their sexual orientation . however , it is difficult to determine an individual 's sexual orientation through scales of assessment , due to ambiguity regarding the definition of sexual orientation . generally , there are three components of sexual orientation used in assessment . their definitions and examples of how they may be assessed are as follows :
stephen hawking and co-author leonard mlodinow state in their book , the grand design , that it is reasonable to ask who or what created the universe , but if the answer is god , then the question has merely been deflected to that of who created god . both authors claim however , that it is possible to answer these questions purely within the realm of science , and without invoking any divine beings . neuroscientist michael nikoletseas has proposed that questions of the existence of god are no different from questions of natural sciences . following a biological comparative approach , he concludes that it is highly probable that god exists , and , although not visible , it is possible that we know some of his attributes .
in 1982 , regis mckenna was brought in to shape the marketing and launch of the macintosh . later the regis mckenna team grew to include jane anderson , katie cadigan and andy cunningham , who eventually led the apple account for the agency . cunningham and anderson were the primary authors of the macintosh launch plan . the launch of the macintosh pioneered many different tactics that are used today in launching technology products , including the " multiple exclusive , " event marketing ( credited to john sculley , who brought the concept over from pepsi ) , creating a mystique around a product and giving an inside look into a product 's creation .
in some design instances , materials used on walls and furniture play a key role in the lighting effect < for example dark paint tends to absorb light , making the room appear smaller and more dim than it is , whereas light paint does the opposite . in addition to paint , reflective surfaces also have an effect on lighting design .
in britain , william paley 's natural theology saw adaptation as evidence of beneficial " design " by the creator acting through natural laws . all naturalists in the two english universities ( oxford and cambridge ) were church of england clergymen , and science became a search for these laws . geologists adapted catastrophism to show repeated worldwide annihilation and creation of new fixed species adapted to a changed environment , initially identifying the most recent catastrophe as the biblical flood . some anatomists such as robert grant were influenced by lamarck and geoffroy , but most naturalists regarded their ideas of transmutation as a threat to divinely appointed social order .
according to the 2010 census , 53.5 % of bronx 's population was of hispanic , latino , or spanish origin ( they may be of any race ) ; 30.1 % non-hispanic black or african american , 10.9 % of the population was non-hispanic white , 3.4 % non-hispanic asian , 0.6 % from some other race ( non-hispanic ) and 1.2 % of two or more races ( non-hispanic ) . the u.s. census considers the bronx to be the most diverse area in the country . there is an 89.7 percent chance that any two residents , chosen at random , would be of different race or ethnicity .
the university first offered graduate degrees , in the form of a master of arts ( ma ) , in the 1854-1855 academic year . the program expanded to include master of laws ( ll.m. ) and master of civil engineering in its early stages of growth , before a formal graduate school education was developed with a thesis not required to receive the degrees . this changed in 1924 with formal requirements developed for graduate degrees , including offering doctorate ( phd ) degrees . today each of the five colleges offer graduate education . most of the departments from the college of arts and letters offer phd programs , while a professional master of divinity ( m.div. ) program also exists . all of the departments in the college of science offer phd programs , except for the department of pre-professional studies . the school of architecture offers a master of architecture , while each of the departments of the college of engineering offer phd programs . the college of business offers multiple professional programs including mba and master of science in accountancy programs . it also operates facilities in chicago and cincinnati for its executive mba program . additionally , the alliance for catholic education program offers a master of education program where students study at the university during the summer and teach in catholic elementary schools , middle schools , and high schools across the southern united states for two school years .
the ban on figurative depiction was not taken so seriously by the jews living in byzantine gaza . in 1966 remains of a synagogue were found in the ancient harbour area . its mosaic floor depicts king david as orpheus , identified by his name in hebrew letters . near him were lion cubs , a giraffe and a snake listening to him playing a lyre . a further portion of the floor was divided by medallions formed by vine leaves , each of which contains an animal : a lioness suckling her cub , a giraffe , peacocks , panthers , bears , a zebra and so on . the floor was paved in 508 / 509 . it is very similar to that of the synagogue at maon ( menois ) and the christian church at shellal , suggesting that the same artist most probably worked at all three places .
the state of tennessee is rooted in the watauga association , a 1772 frontier pact generally regarded as the first constitutional government west of the appalachians . what is now tennessee was initially part of north carolina , and later part of the southwest territory . tennessee was admitted to the union as the 16th state on june 1 , 1796 . tennessee was the last state to leave the union and join the confederacy at the outbreak of the u.s. civil war in 1861 . occupied by union forces from 1862 , it was the first state to be readmitted to the union at the end of the war .
in 1967 tom and jerry cartoons first aired on bbc one , with around 2 episodes shown every evening at 17 : 00 , with occasional morning showings on cbbc . the bbc stopped airing the famous cartoon duo in 2000 .
geneva and the nearby french department of ain co-host the world 's largest laboratory , cern , dedicated to particle physics research . another important research center is the paul scherrer institute . notable inventions include lysergic acid diethylamide ( lsd ) , the scanning tunneling microscope ( nobel prize ) and velcro . some technologies enabled the exploration of new worlds such as the pressurized balloon of auguste piccard and the bathyscaphe which permitted jacques piccard to reach the deepest point of the world 's oceans .
drug discovery and development is very expensive ; of all compounds investigated for use in humans only a small fraction are eventually approved in most nations by government appointed medical institutions or boards , who have to approve new drugs before they can be marketed in those countries . in 2010 18 nmes ( new molecular entities ) were approved and three biologics by the fda , or 21 in total , which is down from 26 in 2009 and 24 in 2008 . on the other hand , there were only 18 approvals in total in 2007 and 22 back in 2006 . since 2001 , the center for drug evaluation and research has averaged 22.9 approvals a year . this approval comes only after heavy investment in pre-clinical development and clinical trials , as well as a commitment to ongoing safety monitoring . drugs which fail part-way through this process often incur large costs , while generating no revenue in return . if the cost of these failed drugs is taken into account , the cost of developing a successful new drug ( new chemical entity , or nce ) , has been estimated at about 1.3 billion usd ( not including marketing expenses ) . professors light and lexchin reported in 2012 , however , that the rate of approval for new drugs has been a relatively stable average rate of 15 to 25 for decades .
the collateralized debt obligation in particular enabled financial institutions to obtain investor funds to finance subprime and other lending , extending or increasing the housing bubble and generating large fees . this essentially places cash payments from multiple mortgages or other debt obligations into a single pool from which specific securities draw in a specific sequence of priority . those securities first in line received investment-grade ratings from rating agencies . securities with lower priority had lower credit ratings but theoretically a higher rate of return on the amount invested .
on 29 may 1842 , victoria was riding in a carriage along the mall , london , when john francis aimed a pistol at her but the gun did not fire ; he escaped . the following day , victoria drove the same route , though faster and with a greater escort , in a deliberate attempt to provoke francis to take a second aim and catch him in the act . as expected , francis shot at her , but he was seized by plain-clothes policemen , and convicted of high treason . on 3 july , two days after francis 's death sentence was commuted to transportation for life , john william bean also tried to fire a pistol at the queen , but it was loaded only with paper and tobacco and had too little charge . edward oxford felt that the attempts were encouraged by his acquittal in 1840 . bean was sentenced to 18 months in jail . in a similar attack in 1849 , unemployed irishman william hamilton fired a powder-filled pistol at victoria 's carriage as it passed along constitution hill , london . in 1850 , the queen did sustain injury when she was assaulted by a possibly insane ex-army officer , robert pate . as victoria was riding in a carriage , pate struck her with his cane , crushing her bonnet and bruising her forehead . both hamilton and pate were sentenced to seven years ' transportation .
jethro burns , best known as half of the comedy duo homer and jethro , was also the first important jazz mandolinist . tiny moore popularized the mandolin in western swing music . he initially played an 8-string gibson but switched after 1952 to a 5-string solidbody electric instrument built by paul bigsby . modern players david grisman , sam bush , and mike marshall , among others , have worked since the early 1970s to demonstrate the mandolin 's versatility for all styles of music . chris thile of california is a well-known player , and has accomplished many feats of traditional bluegrass , classical , contemporary pop and rock ; the band nickel creek featured his playing in its blend of traditional and pop styles , and he now plays in his band punch brothers . most commonly associated with bluegrass , mandolin has been used a lot in country music over the years . some well-known players include marty stuart , vince gill , and ricky skaggs .
the cubs had no official physical mascot prior to clark , though a man in a ' polar bear ' looking outfit , called " the bear-man " ( or beeman ) , which was mildly popular with the fans , paraded the stands briefly in the early 1990s . there is no record of whether or not he was just a fan in a costume or employed by the club . through the 2013 season , there were " cubbie-bear " mascots outside of wrigley on game day , but none are employed by the team . they pose for pictures with fans for tips . the most notable of these was " billy cub " who worked outside of the stadium until for over 6 years until july 2013 , when the club asked him to stop . billy cub , who is played by fan john paul weier , had unsuccessfully petitioned the team to become the official mascot .
in november 2012 , a referendum resulted in 54 percent of respondents voting to reject the current status under the territorial clause of the u.s. constitution , while a second question resulted in 61 percent of voters identifying statehood as the preferred alternative to the current territorial status . the 2012 referendum was by far the most successful referendum for statehood advocates and support for statehood has risen in each successive popular referendum . however , more than one in four voters abstained from answering the question on the preferred alternative status . statehood opponents have argued that the statehood option garnered only 45 percent of the votes if abstentions are included . if abstentions are considered , the result of the referendum is much closer to 44 percent for statehood , a number that falls under the 50 percent majority mark .
much of the early colonial art stemmed from the codices ( aztec illustrated books ) , aiming to recover and preserve some aztec and other amerindian iconography and history . from then , artistic expressions in mexico were mostly religious in theme . the metropolitan cathedral still displays works by juan de rojas , juan correa and an oil painting whose authorship has been attributed to murillo . secular works of art of this period include the equestrian sculpture of charles iv of spain , locally known as el caballito ( " the little horse " ) . this piece , in bronze , was the work of manuel tolsa and it has been placed at the plaza tolsa , in front of the palacio de mineria ( mining palace ) . directly in front of this building is the beautiful museo nacional de arte ( munal ) ( the national museum of art ) .
on september 23 , 1908 , the cubs and new york giants were involved in a tight pennant race . the two clubs were tied in the bottom of the ninth inning at the polo grounds , and n.y. had runners on first and third and two outs when al bridwell singled , scoring moose mccormick from third with the giants ' apparent winning run , but the runner on first base , rookie fred merkle , left the field without touching second base . as fans swarmed the field , cub infielder johnny evers retrieved the ball and touched second . since there were two outs , a forceout was called at second base , ending the inning and the game . because of the tie the giants and cubs ended up tied for first place . the giants lost the ensuing one-game playoff and the cubs went on to the world series .
the end of medieval drama came about due to a number of factors , including the weakening power of the catholic church , the protestant reformation and the banning of religious plays in many countries . elizabeth i forbid all religious plays in 1558 and the great cycle plays had been silenced by the 1580s . similarly , religious plays were banned in the netherlands in 1539 , the papal states in 1547 and in paris in 1548 . the abandonment of these plays destroyed the international theatre that had thereto existed and forced each country to develop its own form of drama . it also allowed dramatists to turn to secular subjects and the reviving interest in greek and roman theatre provided them with the perfect opportunity .
impermanence ( pali : anicca ) expresses the buddhist notion that all compounded or conditioned phenomena ( all things and experiences ) are inconstant , unsteady , and impermanent . everything we can experience through our senses is made up of parts , and its existence is dependent on external conditions . everything is in constant flux , and so conditions and the thing itself are constantly changing . things are constantly coming into being , and ceasing to be . since nothing lasts , there is no inherent or fixed nature to any object or experience . according to the doctrine of impermanence , life embodies this flux in the aging process , the cycle of rebirth ( samsara ) , and in any experience of loss . the doctrine asserts that because things are impermanent , attachment to them is futile and leads to suffering ( dukkha ) .
the power of parliament to pass bills was often thwarted by monarchs . charles i dissolved parliament in 1629 , after it passed motions critical of and bills seeking to restrict his arbitrary exercise of power . during the eleven years of personal rule that followed , charles performed legally dubious actions , such as raising taxes without parliament 's approval . after the english civil war , it was accepted that parliament should be summoned to meet regularly , but it was still commonplace for monarchs to refuse royal assent to bills . in 1678 , charles ii withheld his assent from a bill " for preserving the peace of the kingdom by raising the militia , and continuing them in duty for two and forty days , " suggesting that he , not parliament , should control the militia . the last stuart monarch , anne , similarly withheld on 11 march 1708 , on the advice of her ministers , her assent from a bill for the settling of militia in scotland . no monarch has since withheld royal assent on a bill passed by the british parliament .
new haven 's economy originally was based in manufacturing , but the postwar period brought rapid industrial decline ; the entire northeast was affected , and medium-sized cities with large working-class populations , like new haven , were hit particularly hard . simultaneously , the growth and expansion of yale university further affected the economic shift . today , over half ( 56 % ) of the city 's economy is now made up of services , in particular education and health care ; yale is the city 's largest employer , followed by yale - new haven hospital . other large employers include st. raphael hospital , smilow cancer hospital , southern connecticut state university , assa abloy manufacturing , the knights of columbus headquarters , higher one , alexion pharmaceuticals , covidien and united illuminating . yale and yale-new haven are also among the largest employers in the state , and provide more $ 100,000 + -salaried positions than any other employer in connecticut .

the discovery of infrared radiation is ascribed to william herschel , the astronomer , in the early 19th century . herschel published his results in 1800 before the royal society of london . herschel used a prism to refract light from the sun and detected the infrared , beyond the red part of the spectrum , through an increase in the temperature recorded on a thermometer . he was surprised at the result and called them " calorific rays . " the term ' infrared ' did not appear until late in the 19th century .
the strategic defence and security review 2015 included £ 178 billion investment in new equipment and capabilities . the review set a defence policy with four primary missions for the armed forces :
due to its large size and wide range of geographic features , the united states contains examples of nearly every global climate . the climate is temperate in most areas , subtropical in the southern united states , tropical in hawaii and southern florida , polar in alaska , semiarid in the great plains west of the 100th meridian , mediterranean in coastal california and arid in the great basin . its comparatively favorable agricultural climate contributed ( in part ) to the country 's rise as a world power , with infrequent severe drought in the major agricultural regions , a general lack of widespread flooding , and a mainly temperate climate that receives adequate precipitation .
during the early 2000s , the usaf fumbled several high profile aircraft procurement projects , such as the missteps on the kc-x program . winslow wheeler has written that this pattern represents " failures of intellect and - much more importantly - ethics . " as a result , the usaf fleet is setting new records for average aircraft age and needs to replace its fleets of fighters , bombers , airborne tankers , and airborne warning aircraft , in an age of restrictive defense budgets . finally in the midst of scandal and failure in maintaining its nuclear arsenal , the civilian and military leaders of the air force were replaced in 2008 .
yale seniors at graduation smash clay pipes underfoot to symbolize passage from their " bright college years , " though in recent history the pipes have been replaced with " bubble pipes . " ( " bright college years , " the university 's alma mater , was penned in 1881 by henry durand , class of 1881 , to the tune of die wacht am rhein . ) yale 's student tour guides tell visitors that students consider it good luck to rub the toe of the statue of theodore dwight woolsey on old campus . actual students rarely do so . in the second half of the 20th century bladderball , a campus-wide game played with a large inflatable ball , became a popular tradition but was banned by administration due to safety concerns . in spite of administration opposition , students revived the game in 2009 , 2011 , and 2014 , but its future remains uncertain .
in an attempt to provide general descriptions that may facilitate the job of law enforcement officers seeking to apprehend suspects , the united states fbi employs the term " race " to summarize the general appearance ( skin color , hair texture , eye shape , and other such easily noticed characteristics ) of individuals whom they are attempting to apprehend . from the perspective of law enforcement officers , it is generally more important to arrive at a description that will readily suggest the general appearance of an individual than to make a scientifically valid categorization by dna or other such means . thus , in addition to assigning a wanted individual to a racial category , such a description will include : height , weight , eye color , scars and other distinguishing characteristics .
during the dutch golden age in the late 16th century onward , the dutch republic dominated world trade in the 17th century , conquering a vast colonial empire and operating the largest fleet of merchantmen of any nation . the county of holland was the wealthiest and most urbanized region in the world .
the discovery of new maritime trade routes by western european states allowed them to avoid the ottoman trade monopoly . the portuguese discovery of the cape of good hope in 1488 initiated a series of ottoman-portuguese naval wars in the indian ocean throughout the 16th century . the somali muslim ajuran empire , allied with the ottomans , defied the portuguese economic monopoly in the indian ocean by employing a new coinage which followed the ottoman pattern , thus proclaiming an attitude of economic independence in regard to the portuguese .
hayek was one of the leading academic critics of collectivism in the 20th century . hayek argued that all forms of collectivism ( even those theoretically based on voluntary co-operation ) could only be maintained by a central authority of some kind . in hayek 's view , the central role of the state should be to maintain the rule of law , with as little arbitrary intervention as possible . in his popular book , the road to serfdom ( 1944 ) and in subsequent academic works , hayek argued that socialism required central economic planning and that such planning in turn leads towards totalitarianism .
hydrogen is highly soluble in many rare earth and transition metals and is soluble in both nanocrystalline and amorphous metals . hydrogen solubility in metals is influenced by local distortions or impurities in the crystal lattice . these properties may be useful when hydrogen is purified by passage through hot palladium disks , but the gas 's high solubility is a metallurgical problem , contributing to the embrittlement of many metals , complicating the design of pipelines and storage tanks .
after a lengthy period of formal racial segregation in the former confederacy following the reconstruction era , and bans on interracial marriage in various parts of the country , more people are openly forming interracial unions . in addition , social conditions have changed and many multiracial people do not believe it is socially advantageous to try to " pass " as white . diverse immigration has brought more mixed-race people into the united states , such as the large population of hispanics identifying as mestizos . since the 1980s , the united states has had a growing multiracial identity movement ( cf . loving day ) . because more americans have insisted on being allowed to acknowledge their mixed racial origins , the 2000 census for the first time allowed residents to check more than one ethno-racial identity and thereby identify as multiracial . in 2008 barack obama was elected as the first multiracial president of the united states ; he acknowledges both sides of his family and identifies as african american .
her diamond jubilee in 2012 marked 60 years on the throne , and celebrations were held throughout her realms , the wider commonwealth , and beyond . in a message released on accession day , she stated : " in this special year , as i dedicate myself anew to your service , i hope we will all be reminded of the power of togetherness and the convening strength of family , friendship and good neighbourliness ... i hope also that this jubilee year will be a time to give thanks for the great advances that have been made since 1952 and to look forward to the future with clear head and warm heart . " she and her husband undertook an extensive tour of the united kingdom , while her children and grandchildren embarked on royal tours of other commonwealth states on her behalf . on 4 june , jubilee beacons were lit around the world . on 18 december , she became the first british sovereign to attend a peacetime cabinet meeting since george iii in 1781 .

the oldest known fossil among the eutheria ( " true beasts " ) is the small shrewlike juramaia sinensis , or " jurassic mother from china , " dated to 160 million years ago in the late jurassic . a later eutherian , eomaia , dated to 125 million years ago in the early cretaceous , possessed some features in common with the marsupials but not with the placentals , evidence that these features were present in the last common ancestor of the two groups but were later lost in the placental lineage . in particular :
yaroslav , known as " the wise , " struggled for power with his brothers . a son of vladimir the great , he was vice-regent of novgorod at the time of his father 's death in 1015 . subsequently , his eldest surviving brother , svyatopolk the accursed , killed three of his other brothers and seized power in kiev . yaroslav , with the active support of the novgorodians and the help of viking mercenaries , defeated svyatopolk and became the grand prince of kiev in 1019 . although he first established his rule over kiev in 1019 , he did not have uncontested rule of all of kievan rus ' until 1036 . like vladimir , yaroslav was eager to improve relations with the rest of europe , especially the byzantine empire . yaroslav 's granddaughter , eupraxia the daughter of his son vsevolod i , prince of kiev , was married to henry iii , holy roman emperor . yaroslav also arranged marriages for his sister and three daughters to the kings of poland , france , hungary and norway . yaroslav promulgated the first east slavic law code , russkaya pravda ; built saint sophia cathedral in kiev and saint sophia cathedral in novgorod ; patronized local clergy and monasticism ; and is said to have founded a school system . yaroslav 's sons developed the great kiev pechersk lavra ( monastery ) , which functioned in kievan rus ' as an ecclesiastical academy .
by the 12th century , romanesque architecture ( termed norman architecture in england because of its association with the norman invasion ) , was established throughout europe and provided the basic architectural forms and units that were to remain in evolution throughout the medieval period . the important categories of building : the cathedral church , the parish church , the monastery , the castle , the palace , the great hall , the gatehouse , the civic building , had been established in the romanesque period .
municipalities ( gemeinden ) : every rural district and every amt is subdivided into municipalities , while every urban district is a municipality in its own right . there are ( as of 6 march 2009 [ update ] ) 12,141 municipalities , which are the smallest administrative units in germany . cities and towns are municipalities as well , also having city rights or town rights ( stadtrechte ) . nowadays , this is mostly just the right to be called a city or town . however , in former times there were many other privileges , including the right to impose local taxes or to allow industry only within city limits .
the bengali renaissance refers to a social reform movement during the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries in the bengal region of india during the period of british rule dominated by english educated bengali hindus . the bengal renaissance can be said to have started with raja ram mohan roy ( 1772-1833 ) and ended with rabindranath tagore ( 1861-1941 ) , although many stalwarts thereafter continued to embody particular aspects of the unique intellectual and creative output of the region . nineteenth century bengal was a unique blend of religious and social reformers , scholars , literary giants , journalists , patriotic orators , and scientists , all merging to form the image of a renaissance , and marked the transition from the ' medieval ' to the ' modern ' .
in may 1955 , mccarthy threatened to issue subpoenas to white house personnel . eisenhower was furious , and issued an order as follows : " it is essential to efficient and effective administration that employees of the executive branch be in a position to be completely candid in advising with each other on official matters ... it is not in the public interest that any of their conversations or communications , or any documents or reproductions , concerning such advice be disclosed . " this was an unprecedented step by eisenhower to protect communication beyond the confines of a cabinet meeting , and soon became a tradition known as executive privilege . ike 's denial of mccarthy 's access to his staff reduced mccarthy 's hearings to rants about trivial matters , and contributed to his ultimate downfall .
the overcrowded conditions of the library was one of the reasons why the riba moved from 9 conduit street to larger premises at 66 portland place in 1934 . the library remained open throughout world war two and was able to shelter the archives of modernist architect adolf loos during the war .

some independent stereo manufacturers including jvc , pioneer , kenwood , alpine , sony , and harman kardon also have ipod-specific integration solutions . alternative connection methods include adapter kits ( that use the cassette deck or the cd changer port ) , audio input jacks , and fm transmitters such as the itrip - although personal fm transmitters are illegal in some countries . many car manufacturers have added audio input jacks as standard .
tiberius ' brother gaius was elected tribune in 123 bc . gaius gracchus ' ultimate goal was to weaken the senate and to strengthen the democratic forces . in the past , for example , the senate would eliminate political rivals either by establishing special judicial commissions or by passing a senatus consultum ultimum ( " ultimate decree of the senate " ) . both devices would allow the senate to bypass the ordinary due process rights that all citizens had . gaius outlawed the judicial commissions , and declared the senatus consultum ultimum to be unconstitutional . gaius then proposed a law which would grant citizenship rights to rome 's italian allies . this last proposal was not popular with the plebeians and he lost much of his support . he stood for election to a third term in 121 bc , but was defeated and then murdered by representatives of the senate with 3,000 of his supporters on capitoline hill in rome . though the senate retained control , the gracchi had strengthened the political influence of the plebeians .
all of the executions which have taken place since the 1936 hanging of bethea in owensboro have been conducted within a wall or enclosure . for example , fred adams was legally hanged in kennett , missouri , on april 2 , 1937 , within a 10-foot ( 3 m ) wooden stockade . roscoe " red " jackson was hanged within a stockade in galena , missouri , on may 26 , 1937 . two kentucky hangings were conducted after galena in which numerous persons were present within a wooden stockade , that of john " peter " montjoy in covington , kentucky on december 17 , 1937 , and that of harold van venison in covington on june 3 , 1938 . an estimated 400 witnesses were present for the hanging of lee simpson in ryegate , montana , on december 30 , 1939 . the execution of timothy mcveigh on june 11 , 2001 was witnessed by some 300 people , some by closed-circuit television .
in 1845 , ireland was hit by a potato blight . in the next four years over a million irish people died and another million emigrated in what became known as the great famine . in ireland , victoria was labelled " the famine queen . " she personally donated £ 2,000 to famine relief , more than any other individual donor , and also supported the maynooth grant to a roman catholic seminary in ireland , despite protestant opposition . the story that she donated only £ 5 in aid to the irish , and on the same day gave the same amount to battersea dogs home , was a myth generated towards the end of the 19th century .
" in 1727 the to-min or ' idle people ' of cheh kiang province ( a ningpo name still existing ) , the yoh-hu or ' music people ' of shanxi province , the si-min or ' small people ' of kiang su ( jiangsu ) province , and the tanka people or ' egg-people ' of canton ( to this day the boat population there ) , were all freed from their social disabilities , and allowed to count as free men . " " cheh kiang " is another romanization for zhejiang . the duomin ( chinese : 惰民 ; pinyin : duo min ; wade-giles : to-min ) are a caste of outcasts in this province .
the development of skyscrapers over 300 feet ( 91 m ) in san diego is attributed to the construction of the el cortez hotel in 1927 , the tallest building in the city from 1927 to 1963 . as time went on multiple buildings claimed the title of san diego 's tallest skyscraper , including the union bank of california building and symphony towers . currently the tallest building in san diego is one america plaza , standing 500 feet ( 150 m ) tall , which was completed in 1991 . the downtown skyline contains no super-talls , as a regulation put in place by the federal aviation administration in the 1970s set a 500 feet ( 152 m ) limit on the height of buildings due to the proximity of san diego international airport . an iconic description of the skyline includes its skyscrapers being compared to the tools of a toolbox .
rejecting offers to direct jaws 2 , king kong and superman , spielberg and actor richard dreyfuss re-convened to work on a film about ufos , which became close encounters of the third kind ( 1977 ) . one of the rare films both written and directed by spielberg , close encounters was a critical and box office hit , giving spielberg his first best director nomination from the academy as well as earning six other academy awards nominations . it won oscars in two categories ( cinematography , vilmos zsigmond , and a special achievement award for sound effects editing , frank e. warner ) . this second blockbuster helped to secure spielberg 's rise . his next film , 1941 , a big-budgeted world war ii farce , was not nearly as successful and though it grossed over $ 92.4 million worldwide ( and did make a small profit for co-producing studios columbia and universal ) it was seen as a disappointment , mainly with the critics .
an influx of interstate and overseas migrants , particularly irish , german and chinese , saw the development of slums including a temporary " tent city " established on the southern banks of the yarra . chinese migrants founded the melbourne chinatown in 1851 , which remains the longest continuous chinese settlement in the western world . in the aftermath of the eureka stockade , mass public support for the plight of the miners resulted in major political changes to the colony , including changes to working conditions across local industries including mining , agriculture and manufacturing . the nationalities involved in the eureka revolt and burke and wills expedition gave an indication of immigration flows in the second half of the nineteenth century .
in 1906 , precipitation hardening alloys were discovered by alfred wilm . precipitation hardening alloys , such as certain alloys of aluminium , titanium , and copper , are heat-treatable alloys that soften when quenched ( cooled quickly ) , and then harden over time . after quenching a ternary alloy of aluminium , copper , and magnesium , wilm discovered that the alloy increased in hardness when left to age at room temperature . although an explanation for the phenomenon was not provided until 1919 , duralumin was one of the first " age hardening " alloys to be used , and was soon followed by many others . because they often exhibit a combination of high strength and low weight , these alloys became widely used in many forms of industry , including the construction of modern aircraft .
the earliest extant samples of connected ( north ) estonian are the so-called kullamaa prayers dating from 1524 and 1528 . in 1525 the first book published in the estonian language was printed . the book was a lutheran manuscript , which never reached the reader and was destroyed immediately after publication .
melbourne 's live performance institutions date from the foundation of the city , with the first theatre , the pavilion , opening in 1841 . the city 's east end theatre district includes theatres that similarly date from 1850s to the 1920s , including the princess theatre , regent theatre , her majesty 's theatre , forum theatre , comedy theatre , and the athenaeum theatre . the melbourne arts precinct in southbank is home to arts centre melbourne , which includes the state theatre , hamer hall , the playhouse and the fairfax studio . the melbourne recital centre and southbank theatre ( principal home of the mtc , which includes the sumner and lawler performance spaces ) are also located in southbank . the sidney myer music bowl , which dates from 1955 , is located in the gardens of kings domain ; and the palais theatre is a feature of the st kilda beach foreshore .
one major difference between baroque music and the classical era that followed it is that the types of instruments used in ensembles were much less standardized . whereas a classical era string quartet consists almost exclusively of two violins , a viola and a cello , a baroque group accompanying a soloist or opera could include one of several different types of keyboard instruments ( e.g. , pipe organ , harpsichord , or clavichord ) , additional stringed chordal instruments ( e.g. , a lute ) and an unspecified number of bass instruments performing the basso continuo bassline , including bowed strings , woodwinds and brass instruments ( e.g. , a cello , contrabass , viol , bassoon , serpent , etc . ) .
in 1852 , elisha otis introduced the safety elevator , which prevented the fall of the cab if the cable broke . the design of the otis safety elevator is somewhat similar to one type still used today . a governor device engages knurled roller ( s ) , locking the elevator to its guides should the elevator descend at excessive speed . he demonstrated it at the new york exposition in the crystal palace in a dramatic , death-defying presentation in 1854 , and the first such passenger elevator was installed at 488 broadway in new york city on march 23 , 1857 .
paul vi revolutionized papal elections by ordering that only cardinals below the age of eighty might participate in future conclaves . in ecclesiae sanctae , his motu proprio of 6 august 1966 , he further invited all bishops to offer their retirement to the pontiff no later than the completion of their 75th year of age . this requirement was extended to all cardinals of the catholic church on 21 november 1970 . with these two stipulations , the pope filled several positions with younger bishops and cardinals , and further internationalized the roman curia in light of several resignations due to age .
copyright holders frequently refer to copyright infringement as theft . in copyright law , infringement does not refer to theft of physical objects that take away the owner 's possession , but an instance where a person exercises one of the exclusive rights of the copyright holder without authorization . courts have distinguished between copyright infringement and theft . for instance , the united states supreme court held in dowling v. united states ( 1985 ) that bootleg phonorecords did not constitute stolen property . instead , " interference with copyright does not easily equate with theft , conversion , or fraud . the copyright act even employs a separate term of art to define one who misappropriates a copyright : ' [ ... ] an infringer of the copyright . ' " the court said that in the case of copyright infringement , the province guaranteed to the copyright holder by copyright law - certain exclusive rights - is invaded , but no control , physical or otherwise , is taken over the copyright , nor is the copyright holder wholly deprived of using the copyrighted work or exercising the exclusive rights held .
this boom in innovative financial products went hand in hand with more complexity . it multiplied the number of actors connected to a single mortgage ( including mortgage brokers , specialized originators , the securitizers and their due diligence firms , managing agents and trading desks , and finally investors , insurances and providers of repo funding ) . with increasing distance from the underlying asset these actors relied more and more on indirect information ( including fico scores on creditworthiness , appraisals and due diligence checks by third party organizations , and most importantly the computer models of rating agencies and risk management desks ) . instead of spreading risk this provided the ground for fraudulent acts , misjudgments and finally market collapse . in 2005 a group of computer scientists built a computational model for the mechanism of biased ratings produced by rating agencies , which turned out to be adequate to what actually happened in 2006-2008 .

the slovenian countryside displays a variety of disguised groups and individual characters among which the most popular and characteristic is the kurent ( plural : kurenti ) , a monstrous and demon-like , but fluffy figure . the most significant festival is held in ptuj ( see : kurentovanje ) . its special feature are the kurents themselves , magical creatures from another world , who visit major events throughout the country , trying to banish the winter and announce spring 's arrival , fertility , and new life with noise and dancing . the origin of the kurent is a mystery , and not much is known of the times , beliefs , or purposes connected with its first appearance . the origin of the name itself is obscure .
lamps designed for different voltages have different luminous efficacy . for example , a 100-watt , 120-volt lamp will produce about 17.1 lumens per watt . a lamp with the same rated lifetime but designed for 230 v would produce only around 12.8 lumens per watt , and a similar lamp designed for 30 volts ( train lighting ) would produce as much as 19.8 lumens per watt . lower voltage lamps have a thicker filament , for the same power rating . they can run hotter for the same lifetime before the filament evaporates .
portuguese wines have enjoyed international recognition since the times of the romans , who associated portugal with their god bacchus . today , the country is known by wine lovers and its wines have won several international prizes . some of the best portuguese wines are : vinho verde , vinho alvarinho , vinho do douro , vinho do alentejo , vinho do dao , vinho da bairrada and the sweet : port wine , madeira wine , the moscatel from setubal and favaios . port and madeira are particularly appreciated in a wide range of places around the world .

this multilevel construct is consistent with dasmann and lovejoy . an explicit definition consistent with this interpretation was first given in a paper by bruce a. wilcox commissioned by the international union for the conservation of nature and natural resources ( iucn ) for the 1982 world national parks conference . wilcox 's definition was " biological diversity is the variety of life forms ... at all levels of biological systems ( i.e. , molecular , organismic , population , species and ecosystem ) .... " the 1992 united nations earth summit defined " biological diversity " as " the variability among living organisms from all sources , including , ' inter alia ' , terrestrial , marine , and other aquatic ecosystems , and the ecological complexes of which they are part : this includes diversity within species , between species and of ecosystems . " this definition is used in the united nations convention on biological diversity .
victoria later described her childhood as " rather melancholy . " her mother was extremely protective , and victoria was raised largely isolated from other children under the so-called " kensington system , " an elaborate set of rules and protocols devised by the duchess and her ambitious and domineering comptroller , sir john conroy , who was rumoured to be the duchess 's lover . the system prevented the princess from meeting people whom her mother and conroy deemed undesirable ( including most of her father 's family ) , and was designed to render her weak and dependent upon them . the duchess avoided the court because she was scandalised by the presence of king william 's bastard children , and perhaps prompted the emergence of victorian morality by insisting that her daughter avoid any appearance of sexual impropriety . victoria shared a bedroom with her mother every night , studied with private tutors to a regular timetable , and spent her play-hours with her dolls and her king charles spaniel , dash . her lessons included french , german , italian , and latin , but she spoke only english at home .
the bronx is almost entirely situated on the north american mainland . the hudson river separates the bronx on the west from alpine , tenafly and englewood cliffs in bergen county , new jersey ; the harlem river separates it from the island of manhattan to the southwest ; the east river separates it from queens to the southeast ; and to the east , long island sound separates it from nassau county in western long island . directly north of the bronx are ( from west to east ) the adjoining westchester county communities of yonkers , mount vernon , pelham manor and new rochelle . ( there is also a short southern land boundary with marble hill in the borough of manhattan , over the filled-in former course of the spuyten duyvil creek . marble hill 's postal zip code , telephonic area code and fire service , however , are shared with the bronx and not manhattan . )
the areas that are not arid and receive high precipitation experience periodic flooding from rapid snowmelt and runoff . the mean precipitation in the alps ranges from a low of 2,600 mm ( 100 in ) per year to 3,600 mm ( 140 in ) per year , with the higher levels occurring at high altitudes . at altitudes between 1,000 and 3,000 m ( 3,281 and 9,843 ft ) , snowfall begins in november and accumulates through to april or may when the melt begins . snow lines vary from 2,400 to 3,000 m ( 7,874 to 9,843 ft ) , above which the snow is permanent and the temperatures hover around the freezing point even july and august . high-water levels in streams and rivers peak in june and july when the snow is still melting at the higher altitudes .
annelids ' cuticles are made of collagen fibers , usually in layers that spiral in alternating directions so that the fibers cross each other . these are secreted by the one-cell deep epidermis ( outermost skin layer ) . a few marine annelids that live in tubes lack cuticles , but their tubes have a similar structure , and mucus-secreting glands in the epidermis protect their skins . under the epidermis is the dermis , which is made of connective tissue , in other words a combination of cells and non-cellular materials such as collagen . below this are two layers of muscles , which develop from the lining of the coelom ( body cavity ) : circular muscles make a segment longer and slimmer when they contract , while under them are longitudinal muscles , usually four distinct strips , whose contractions make the segment shorter and fatter . some annelids also have oblique internal muscles that connect the underside of the body to each side .
nigeria is a federal republic modelled after the united states , with executive power exercised by the president . it is influenced by the westminster system model [ citation needed ] in the composition and management of the upper and lower houses of the bicameral legislature . the president presides as both head of state and head of the national executive ; the leader is elected by popular vote to a maximum of two 4-year terms . in the march 28 , 2015 presidential election , general muhammadu buhari emerged victorious to become the federal president of nigeria , defeating then incumbent goodluck jonathan .
clovis the frank , the first king of the merovingian dynasty , made the city his capital from 508 . a gradual immigration by the franks also occurred in paris in the beginning of the frankish domination of gaul which created the parisian francien dialects . fortification of the ile-de-france failed to prevent sacking by vikings in 845 but paris ' strategic importance - with its bridges preventing ships from passing - was established by successful defence in the siege of paris ( 885-86 ) . in 987 hugh capet , count of paris ( comte de paris ) , duke of the franks ( duc des francs ) was elected king of the franks ( roi des franks ) . under the rule of the capetian kings , paris gradually became the largest and most prosperous city in france .
sociocultural anthropology draws together the principle axes of cultural anthropology and social anthropology . cultural anthropology is the comparative study of the manifold ways in which people make sense of the world around them , while social anthropology is the study of the relationships among persons and groups . cultural anthropology is more related to philosophy , literature and the arts ( how one 's culture affects experience for self and group , contributing to more complete understanding of the people 's knowledge , customs , and institutions ) , while social anthropology is more related to sociology and history. in that it helps develop understanding of social structures , typically of others and other populations ( such as minorities , subgroups , dissidents , etc . ) . there is no hard-and-fast distinction between them , and these categories overlap to a considerable degree .
federalism is one of the entrenched constitutional principles of germany . according to the german constitution ( called grundgesetz or in english basic law ) , some topics , such as foreign affairs and defense , are the exclusive responsibility of the federation ( i.e. , the federal level ) , while others fall under the shared authority of the states and the federation ; the states retain residual legislative authority for all other areas , including " culture , " which in germany includes not only topics such as financial promotion of arts and sciences , but also most forms of education and job training . though international relations including international treaties are primarily the responsibility of the federal level , the constituent states have certain limited powers in this area : in matters that affect them directly , the states defend their interests at the federal level through the bundesrat ( literally federal council , the upper house of the german federal parliament ) and in areas where they have legislative authority they have limited powers to conclude international treaties " with the consent of the federal government . "
the golden boot is awarded to the top premier league scorer at the end of each season . former blackburn rovers and newcastle united striker alan shearer holds the record for most premier league goals with 260 . twenty-four players have reached the 100-goal mark . since the first premier league season in 1992-93 , 14 different players from 10 different clubs have won or shared the top scorers title . thierry henry won his fourth overall scoring title by scoring 27 goals in the 2005-06 season . andrew cole and alan shearer hold the record for most goals in a season ( 34 ) - for newcastle and blackburn respectively . ryan giggs of manchester united holds the record for scoring goals in consecutive seasons , having scored in the first 21 seasons of the league .
like maradona , ronaldo only stayed a short time before he left for internazionale . however , new heroes emerged , such as luis figo , patrick kluivert , luis enrique and rivaldo , and the team won a copa del rey and la liga double in 1998 . in 1999 , the club celebrated its centenari , winning the primera division title , and rivaldo became the fourth barcelona player to be awarded european footballer of the year . despite this domestic success , the failure to emulate real madrid in the champions league led to van gaal and nunez resigning in 2000 .
schwarzenegger 's official height of 6 ' 2 " ( 1.88 m ) has been brought into question by several articles . in his bodybuilding days in the late 1960s , he was measured to be 6 ' 1.5 " ( 1.87 m ) , a height confirmed by his fellow bodybuilders . however , in 1988 both the daily mail and time out magazine mentioned that schwarzenegger appeared noticeably shorter . prior to running for governor , schwarzenegger 's height was once again questioned in an article by the chicago reader . as governor , schwarzenegger engaged in a light-hearted exchange with assemblyman herb wesson over their heights . at one point , wesson made an unsuccessful attempt to , in his own words , " settle this once and for all and find out how tall he is " by using a tailor 's tape measure on the governor . schwarzenegger retaliated by placing a pillow stitched with the words " need a lift ? " on the five-foot-five inch ( 165 cm ) wesson 's chair before a negotiating session in his office . bob mulholland also claimed schwarzenegger was 5 ' 10 " ( 1.78 m ) and that he wore risers in his boots . in 1999 , men 's health magazine stated his height was 5 ' 10 . "
in spite of their flaws , such as the lack of portability , records still have enthusiastic supporters . vinyl records continue to be manufactured and sold today , especially by independent rock bands and labels , although record sales are considered to be a niche market composed of audiophiles , collectors , and djs . old records and out-of-print recordings in particular are in much demand by collectors the world over . ( see record collecting . ) many popular new albums are given releases on vinyl records and older albums are also given reissues , sometimes on audiophile-grade vinyl .
describing his sixth studio album yeezus ( 2013 ) as " a protest to music , " west embraced an abrasive style that incorporated industrial music , acid house , dancehall , punk , electro , and chicago drill . inspired by the minimalist design of le corbusier and primarily electronic in nature , the album features distorted drum machines and " synthesizers that sound like they 're malfunctioning , low-resolution samplers that add a pixelated digital aura to the most analog sounds . " to this end , the album incorporates glitches reminiscent of cd skips or corrupted mp3 's , and auto-tuned vocals are modulated to a point in which they are difficult to decipher . it also continues west 's practice of eclectic samples : he employs a sample of nina simone 's " strange fruit , " an obscure hindi sample on " i am a god , " and a sample of 1970s hungarian rock group omega on " new slaves . " " on sight " interpolates a melody from " sermon ( he 'll give us what we really need ) " by the holy name of mary choral family . rolling stone called the album a " brilliant , obsessive-compulsive career auto-correct . "
in a united states geological survey ( usgs ) study , preliminary rupture models of the earthquake indicated displacement of up to 9 meters along a fault approximately 240 km long by 20 km deep . the earthquake generated deformations of the surface greater than 3 meters and increased the stress ( and probability of occurrence of future events ) at the northeastern and southwestern ends of the fault . on may 20 , usgs seismologist tom parsons warned that there is " high risk " of a major m > 7 aftershock over the next weeks or months .
in the spring of 1834 , chopin attended the lower rhenish music festival in aix-la-chapelle with hiller , and it was there that chopin met felix mendelssohn . after the festival , the three visited dusseldorf , where mendelssohn had been appointed musical director . they spent what mendelssohn described as " a very agreeable day , " playing and discussing music at his piano , and met friedrich wilhelm schadow , director of the academy of art , and some of his eminent pupils such as lessing , bendemann , hildebrandt and sohn . in 1835 chopin went to carlsbad , where he spent time with his parents ; it was the last time he would see them . on his way back to paris , he met old friends from warsaw , the wodzinskis . he had made the acquaintance of their daughter maria in poland five years earlier , when she was eleven . this meeting prompted him to stay for two weeks in dresden , when he had previously intended to return to paris via leipzig . the sixteen-year-old girl 's portrait of the composer is considered , along with delacroix 's , as among chopin 's best likenesses . in october he finally reached leipzig , where he met schumann , clara wieck and felix mendelssohn , who organised for him a performance of his own oratorio st. paul , and who considered him " a perfect musician . " in july 1836 chopin travelled to marienbad and dresden to be with the wodzinski family , and in september he proposed to maria , whose mother countess wodzinska approved in principle . chopin went on to leipzig , where he presented schumann with his g minor ballade . at the end of 1836 he sent maria an album in which his sister ludwika had inscribed seven of his songs , and his 1835 nocturne in c-sharp minor , op. 27 , no. 1 . the anodyne thanks he received from maria proved to be the last letter he was to have from her .
although it had equipment capable of doing serious damage , the problem for the luftwaffe was its unclear strategy and poor intelligence . okl had not been informed that britain was to be considered a potential opponent until early 1938 . it had no time to gather reliable intelligence on britain 's industries . moreover , okl could not settle on an appropriate strategy . german planners had to decide whether the luftwaffe should deliver the weight of its attacks against a specific segment of british industry such as aircraft factories , or against a system of interrelated industries such as britain 's import and distribution network , or even in a blow aimed at breaking the morale of the british population . the luftwaffe 's strategy became increasingly aimless over the winter of 1940-1941 . disputes among the okl staff revolved more around tactics than strategy . this method condemned the offensive over britain to failure before it began .
after a series of test transmissions and special broadcasts that began in august , regular bbc television broadcasts officially resumed on 1 october 1936 , from a converted wing of alexandra palace in london , which housed two studios , various scenery stores , make-up areas , dressing rooms , offices , and the transmitter itself , now broadcasting on the vhf band . bbc television initially used two systems , on alternate weeks : the 240-line baird intermediate film system and the 405-line marconi-emi system , each making the bbc the world 's first regular high-definition television service , broadcasting monday to saturday from 15 : 00 to 16 : 00 and 21 : 00 to 22 : 00 .
boston has been a noted religious center from its earliest days . the roman catholic archdiocese of boston serves nearly 300 parishes and is based in the cathedral of the holy cross ( 1875 ) in the south end , while the episcopal diocese of massachusetts , with the cathedral church of st. paul ( 1819 ) as its episcopal seat , serves just under 200 congregations . unitarian universalism has its headquarters on beacon hill . the christian scientists are headquartered in back bay at the mother church ( 1894 ) . the oldest church in boston is first church in boston , founded in 1630 . king 's chapel , the city 's first anglican church , was founded in 1686 and converted to unitarianism in 1785 . other churches include christ church ( better known as old north church , 1723 ) , the oldest church building in the city , trinity church ( 1733 ) , park street church ( 1809 ) , old south church ( 1874 ) , jubilee christian church and basilica and shrine of our lady of perpetual help on mission hill ( 1878 ) .

alexis de tocqueville described the french revolution as the inevitable result of the radical opposition created in the 18th century between the monarchy and the men of letters of the enlightenment . these men of letters constituted a sort of " substitute aristocracy that was both all-powerful and without real power . " this illusory power came from the rise of " public opinion , " born when absolutist centralization removed the nobility and the bourgeoisie from the political sphere . the " literary politics " that resulted promoted a discourse of equality and was hence in fundamental opposition to the monarchical regime . de tocqueville " clearly designates ... the cultural effects of transformation in the forms of the exercise of power . " nevertheless , it took another century before cultural approach became central to the historiography , as typified by robert darnton , the business of enlightenment : a publishing history of the encyclopedie , 1775-1800 ( 1979 ) .
after a tentative creation of several smaller suburban cemeteries , the prefect nicholas frochot under napoleon bonaparte provided a more definitive solution in the creation of three massive parisian cemeteries outside the city limits . open from 1804 , these were the cemeteries of pere lachaise , montmartre , montparnasse , and later passy ; these cemeteries became inner-city once again when paris annexed all neighbouring communes to the inside of its much larger ring of suburban fortifications in 1860 . new suburban cemeteries were created in the early 20th century : the largest of these are the cimetiere parisien de saint-ouen , the cimetiere parisien de pantin ( also known as cimetiere parisien de pantin-bobigny , the cimetiere parisien d 'ivry , and the cimetiere parisien de bagneux ) . [ citation needed ] some of the most famous people in the world are buried in parisian cemeteries .
while textual criticism developed into a discipline of thorough analysis of the bible - both the hebrew bible and the new testament - scholars also use it to determine the original content of classic texts , such as plato 's republic . there are far fewer witnesses to classical texts than to the bible , so scholars can use stemmatics and , in some cases , copy text editing . however , unlike the new testament where the earliest witnesses are within 200 years of the original , the earliest existing manuscripts of most classical texts were written about a millennium after their composition . all things being equal , textual scholars expect that a larger time gap between an original and a manuscript means more changes in the text .
in the next two years , the company established its first factory in south india in the town of machilipatnam on the coromandel coast of the bay of bengal . the high profits reported by the company after landing in india initially prompted king james i to grant subsidiary licences to other trading companies in england . but in 1609 he renewed the charter given to the company for an indefinite period , including a clause that specified that the charter would cease to be in force if the trade turned unprofitable for three consecutive years .
during the post-world war i period ski-lifts were built in swiss and austrian towns to accommodate winter visitors , but summer tourism continued to be important ; by the mid-20th century the popularity of downhill skiing increased greatly as it became more accessible and in the 1970s several new villages were built in france devoted almost exclusively to skiing , such as les menuires . until this point austria and switzerland had been the traditional and more popular destinations for winter sports , but by the end of the 20th century and into the early 21st century , france , italy and the tyrol began to see increases in winter visitors . from 1980 to the present , ski-lifts have been modernized and snow-making machines installed at many resorts , leading to concerns regarding the loss of traditional alpine culture and questions regarding sustainable development as the winter ski industry continues to develop quickly and the number of summer tourists decline .
the foreign and commonwealth office of united kingdom recognises a middle east and north africa region , but not a near east . their original middle east consumed the near east as far as the red sea , ceded india to the asia and oceania region , and went into partnership with north africa as far as the atlantic .
in 1853 , victoria gave birth to her eighth child , leopold , with the aid of the new anaesthetic , chloroform . victoria was so impressed by the relief it gave from the pain of childbirth that she used it again in 1857 at the birth of her ninth and final child , beatrice , despite opposition from members of the clergy , who considered it against biblical teaching , and members of the medical profession , who thought it dangerous . victoria may have suffered from post-natal depression after many of her pregnancies . letters from albert to victoria intermittently complain of her loss of self-control . for example , about a month after leopold 's birth albert complained in a letter to victoria about her " continuance of hysterics " over a " miserable trifle . "
in the last two decades , photovoltaics ( pv ) , also known as solar pv , has evolved from a pure niche market of small scale applications towards becoming a mainstream electricity source . a solar cell is a device that converts light directly into electricity using the photoelectric effect . the first solar cell was constructed by charles fritts in the 1880s . in 1931 a german engineer , dr bruno lange , developed a photo cell using silver selenide in place of copper oxide . although the prototype selenium cells converted less than 1 % of incident light into electricity , both ernst werner von siemens and james clerk maxwell recognized the importance of this discovery . following the work of russell ohl in the 1940s , researchers gerald pearson , calvin fuller and daryl chapin created the crystalline silicon solar cell in 1954 . these early solar cells cost 286 usd / watt and reached efficiencies of 4.5-6 % . by 2012 available efficiencies exceed 20 % and the maximum efficiency of research photovoltaics is over 40 % .
there is a variety of annual events , beginning with the relatively new new year 's day parade , fireworks display at the london eye , the world 's second largest street party , the notting hill carnival is held during the late august bank holiday each year . traditional parades include november 's lord mayor 's show , a centuries-old event celebrating the annual appointment of a new lord mayor of the city of london with a procession along the streets of the city , and june 's trooping the colour , a formal military pageant performed by regiments of the commonwealth and british armies to celebrate the queen 's official birthday .
the languages have not undergone the deliberate highlighting of minor linguistic differences in the name of nationalism as has occurred in the bosnian , serbian and croatian standards of serbo-croatian . however , most slavic languages ( including czech ) have been distanced in this way from russian influences because of widespread public resentment against the former soviet union ( which occupied czechoslovakia in 1968 ) . czech and slovak form a dialect continuum , with great similarity between neighboring czech and slovak dialects . ( see " dialects " below . )
the palacio taranco is located in front of the plaza zabala , in the heart of ciudad vieja . it was erected in the early 20th century as the residence of the ortiz taranco brothers on the ruins of montevideo 's first theatre ( of 1793 ) , during a period in which the architectural style was influenced by french architecture . the palace was designed by french architects charles louis girault and jules chifflot leon who also designed the petit palais and the arc de triomphe in paris . it passed to the city from the heirs of the tarancos in 1943 , along with its precious collection of uruguayan furniture and draperies and was deemed by the city as an ideal place for a museum ; in 1972 it became the museum of decorative arts of montevideo and in 1975 it became a national heritage site . the decorative arts museum has an important collection of european paintings and decorative arts , ancient greek and roman art and islamic ceramics of the 10th-18th century from the area of present-day iran . the palace is often used as a meeting place by the uruguayan government .

there is evidence of induced copper deficiency in those taking 100-300 mg of zinc daily . a 2007 trial observed that elderly men taking 80 mg daily were hospitalized for urinary complications more often than those taking a placebo . the usda rda is 11 and 8 mg zn / day for men and women , respectively . levels of 100-300 mg may interfere with the utilization of copper and iron or adversely affect cholesterol . levels of zinc in excess of 500 ppm in soil interfere with the ability of plants to absorb other essential metals , such as iron and manganese . there is also a condition called the zinc shakes or " zinc chills " that can be induced by the inhalation of freshly formed zinc oxide formed during the welding of galvanized materials . zinc is a common ingredient of denture cream which may contain between 17 and 38 mg of zinc per gram . there have been claims of disability , and even death , due to excessive use of these products .
the term pewter covers a variety of alloys consisting primarily of tin . as a pure metal , tin was much too soft to be used for any practical purpose . however , in the bronze age , tin was a rare metal and , in many parts of europe and the mediterranean , was often valued higher than gold . to make jewelry , forks and spoons , or other objects from tin , it was usually alloyed with other metals to increase its strength and hardness . these metals were typically lead , antimony , bismuth or copper . these solutes sometimes were added individually in varying amounts , or added together , making a wide variety of things , ranging from practical items , like dishes , surgical tools , candlesticks or funnels , to decorative items such as ear rings and hair clips .
this format often includes dance-pop ( such as upbeat songs by madonna , cher , gloria estefan and kylie minogue ) , power pops ( mainly by boybands such as backstreet boys and westlife ) , and adult-oriented soft rock music that are ballad-driven ( typically by aerosmith [ citation needed ] , the eagles , sting , toto and the moody blues ) . generally , hot ac radio stations target their music output towards the 18-54 age group and a demographic audience of both men and women .
sweet desserts such as galaktoboureko , and drinks such as ouzo , metaxa and a variety of wines including retsina . greek cuisine differs widely from different parts of the mainland and from island to island . it uses some flavorings more often than other mediterranean cuisines : oregano , mint , garlic , onion , dill and bay laurel leaves . other common herbs and spices include basil , thyme and fennel seed . many greek recipes , especially in the northern parts of the country , use " sweet " spices in combination with meat , for example cinnamon and cloves in stews .
the other large cemeteries are the cementerio del buceo , cementerio del cerro , and cementerio paso molino . the british cemetery montevideo ( cementerio britanico ) is another of the oldest cemeteries in uruguay , located in the buceo neighborhood . many noblemen and eminent persons are buried there . the cemetery originated when the englishman mr. thomas samuel hood purchased a plot of land in the name of the english residents in 1828 . however , in 1884 the government compensated the british by moving the cemetery to buceo to accommodate city growth . a section of the cemetery , known as british cemetery montevideo soldiers and sailors , contains the graves of quite a number of sailors of different nationalities , although the majority are of british descent . one united states marine , henry de costa , is buried here .
according to author michael carrithers , while there are good reasons to doubt the traditional account , " the outline of the life must be true : birth , maturity , renunciation , search , awakening and liberation , teaching , death . " in writing her biography of the buddha , karen armstrong noted , " it is obviously difficult , therefore , to write a biography of the buddha that meets modern criteria , because we have very little information that can be considered historically sound ... [ but ] we can be reasonably confident siddhatta gotama did indeed exist and that his disciples preserved the memory of his life and teachings as well as they could . " [ dubious - discuss ]
between ad 300 and 1300 in the northern part of the state along the wide , fertile valley on the san miguel river the casas grandes ( big houses ) culture developed into an advanced civilization . the casas grandes civilization is part of a major prehistoric archaeological culture known as mogollon which is related to the ancestral pueblo culture . paquime was the center of the casas grandes civilization . extensive archaeological evidence shows commerce , agriculture , and hunting at paquime and cuarenta casas ( forty houses ) .
burke claimed that bolingbroke 's arguments against revealed religion could apply to all social and civil institutions as well . lord chesterfield and bishop warburton ( and others ) initially thought that the work was genuinely by bolingbroke rather than a satire . all the reviews of the work were positive , with critics especially appreciative of burke 's quality of writing . some reviewers failed to notice the ironic nature of the book , which led to burke stating in the preface to the second edition ( 1757 ) that it was a satire .
cycling is popular in tucson due to its flat terrain and dry climate . tucson and pima county maintain an extensive network of marked bike routes , signal crossings , on-street bike lanes , mountain-biking trails , and dedicated shared-use paths . the loop is a network of seven linear parks comprising over 100 mi ( 160 km ) of paved , vehicle-free trails that encircles the majority of the city with links to marana and oro valley . the tucson-pima county bicycle advisory committee ( tpcbac ) serves in an advisory capacity to local governments on issues relating to bicycle recreation , transportation , and safety . tucson was awarded a gold rating for bicycle-friendliness by the league of american bicyclists in 2006 .

united states of america : the torch relay 's north american leg occurred in san francisco , california on april 9 . on the day of the relay officials diverted the torch run to an unannounced route . the start was at mccovey cove , where norman bellingham of the u.s. olympic committee gave the torch to the first torchbearer , chinese 1992 olympic champion swimmer lin li . the planned closing ceremony at justin herman plaza was cancelled and instead , a ceremony was held at san francisco international airport , where the torch was to leave for buenos aires . the route changes allowed the run to avoid large numbers of china supporters and protesters against china . as people found out there would be no closing ceremony at justin herman plaza , there were angry reactions . one demonstrator was quoted as saying that the route changes were an effort to " thwart any organized protest that had been planned . " san francisco board of supervisors president aaron peskin , a critic of mayor gavin newsom , said that it was a " cynical plan to please the bush state department and the chinese government because of the incredible influence of money . " newsom , on the other hand , said he felt it was in " everyone 's best interest " and that he believed people had been " afforded the right to protest and support the torch " despite the route changes . peter ueberroth , head of the u.s. olympic committee , praised the route changes , saying , " the city of san francisco , from a global perspective , will be applauded . " people who saw the torch were surprised and cheered as shown from live video of cbs and nbc . the cost to the city for hosting the event was reported to be usd $ 726,400 , nearly half of which has been recovered by private fundraising . mayor gavin newsom said that " exponential " costs associated with mass arrests were avoided by his decision to change the route in consultation with police chief heather fong .
the ottoman navy vastly contributed to the expansion of the empire 's territories on the european continent . it initiated the conquest of north africa , with the addition of algeria and egypt to the ottoman empire in 1517 . starting with the loss of greece in 1821 and algeria in 1830 , ottoman naval power and control over the empire 's distant overseas territories began to decline . sultan abdulaziz ( reigned 1861-1876 ) attempted to reestablish a strong ottoman navy , building the largest fleet after those of britain and france . the shipyard at barrow , england , built its first submarine in 1886 for the ottoman empire .
in the 15th century the dome was added and the naves extended back of the choir , uniting the building to the tower and forming a main entrance . archbishop luis alfonso de los cameros began the building of the main chapel in 1674 ; the walls were decorated with marbles and bronzes in the baroque style of that period . at the beginning of the 18th century the german conrad rudolphus built the facade of the main entrance . the other two doors lead into the transept ; one , that of the apostles in pure pointed gothic , dates from the 14th century , the other is that of the palau . the additions made to the back of the cathedral detract from its height . the 18th-century restoration rounded the pointed arches , covered the gothic columns with corinthian pillars , and redecorated the walls . the dome has no lantern , its plain ceiling being pierced by two large side windows . there are four chapels on either side , besides that at the end and those that open into the choir , the transept , and the sanctuary . it contains many paintings by eminent artists . a silver reredos , which was behind the altar , was carried away in the war of 1808 , and converted into coin to meet the expenses of the campaign . there are two paintings by francisco goya in the san francesco chapel . behind the chapel of the blessed sacrament is a small renaissance chapel built by calixtus iii . beside the cathedral is the chapel dedicated to the our lady of the forsaken ( virgen de los desamparados or mare de deu dels desamparats ) .

the ability of birds to return to precise locations across vast distances has been known for some time ; in an experiment conducted in the 1950s a manx shearwater released in boston returned to its colony in skomer , wales , within 13 days , a distance of 5,150 km ( 3,200 mi ) . birds navigate during migration using a variety of methods . for diurnal migrants , the sun is used to navigate by day , and a stellar compass is used at night . birds that use the sun compensate for the changing position of the sun during the day by the use of an internal clock . orientation with the stellar compass depends on the position of the constellations surrounding polaris . these are backed up in some species by their ability to sense the earth 's geomagnetism through specialised photoreceptors .
the word " police " was borrowed from french into the english language in the 18th century , but for a long time it applied only to french and continental european police forces . the word , and the concept of police itself , were " disliked as a symbol of foreign oppression " ( according to britannica 1911 ) . before the 19th century , the first use of the word " police " recorded in government documents in the united kingdom was the appointment of commissioners of police for scotland in 1714 and the creation of the marine police in 1798 .
the persian gulf war was a conflict between iraq and a coalition force of 34 nations led by the united states . the lead up to the war began with the iraqi invasion of kuwait in august 1990 which was met with immediate economic sanctions by the united nations against iraq . the coalition commenced hostilities in january 1991 , resulting in a decisive victory for the u.s. led coalition forces , which drove iraqi forces out of kuwait with minimal coalition deaths . despite the low death toll , over 180,000 us veterans would later be classified as " permanently disabled " according to the us department of veterans affairs ( see gulf war syndrome ) . the main battles were aerial and ground combat within iraq , kuwait and bordering areas of saudi arabia . land combat did not expand outside of the immediate iraq / kuwait / saudi border region , although the coalition bombed cities and strategic targets across iraq , and iraq fired missiles on israeli and saudi cities .
on leaving the university of oxford , in 1676 , edmond halley visited saint helena and set up an astronomical observatory with a 7.3-metre-long ( 24 ft ) aerial telescope with the intention of studying stars from the southern hemisphere . the site of this telescope is near saint mathew 's church in hutt 's gate , in the longwood district . the 680-metre ( 2,230 ft ) high hill there is named for him and is called halley 's mount .
in 1937 , the empire of japan started a full-scale invasion of china after invading manchuria in 1931 , beginning the second sino-japanese war ( often considered a theatre of world war ii ) . their troops occupied nanjing in december and carried out the systematic and brutal nanking massacre ( the " rape of nanking " ) . even children , the elderly , and nuns are reported to have suffered at the hands of the imperial japanese army . the total death toll , including estimates made by the international military tribunal for the far east and the nanjing war crimes tribunal , was between 300,000 and 350,000 . the city itself was also severely damaged during the massacre . the nanjing massacre memorial hall was built in 1985 to commemorate this event .
while nasser was increasingly criticized by egyptian intellectuals following the six-day war and his death in 1970 , the general public was persistently sympathetic both during and after nasser 's life . according to political scientist mahmoud hamad , writing in 2008 , " nostalgia for nasser is easily sensed in egypt and all arab countries today . " general malaise in egyptian society , particularly during the mubarak era , augmented nostalgia for nasser 's presidency , which increasingly became associated with the ideals of national purpose , hope , social cohesion , and vibrant culture .
glass remained a luxury material , and the disasters that overtook late bronze age civilizations seem to have brought glass-making to a halt . indigenous development of glass technology in south asia may have begun in 1730 bce . in ancient china , though , glassmaking seems to have a late start , compared to ceramics and metal work . the term glass developed in the late roman empire . it was in the roman glassmaking center at trier , now in modern germany , that the late-latin term glesum originated , probably from a germanic word for a transparent , lustrous substance . glass objects have been recovered across the roman empire in domestic , industrial and funerary contexts .

from the middle of the 3rd century germanic tribes regularly invaded the roman territories . around 275 the romans could no longer maintain the northern border and utrecht was abandoned . little is known about the next period 270-650 . utrecht is first spoken of again several centuries after the romans left . under the influence of the growing realms of the franks , during dagobert i 's reign in the 7th century , a church was built within the walls of the roman fortress . in ongoing border conflicts with the frisians this first church was destroyed .
nonverbal communication describes the process of conveying meaning in the form of non-word messages . examples of nonverbal communication include haptic communication , chronemic communication , gestures , body language , facial expression , eye contact , and how one dresses . nonverbal communication also relates to intent of a message . examples of intent are voluntary , intentional movements like shaking a hand or winking , as well as involuntary , such as sweating . speech also contains nonverbal elements known as paralanguage , e.g. rhythm , intonation , tempo , and stress . there may even be a pheromone component . research has shown that up to 55 % of human communication may occur through non-verbal facial expressions , and a further 38 % through paralanguage . it affects communication most at the subconscious level and establishes trust . likewise , written texts include nonverbal elements such as handwriting style , spatial arrangement of words and the use of emoticons to convey emotion .
" digimon " are " digital monsters . " according to the stories , they are inhabitants of the " digiworld , " a manifestation of earth 's communication network . the stories tell of a group of mostly pre-teens , who accompany special digimon born to defend their world ( and ours ) from various evil forces . to help them surmount the most difficult obstacles found within both realms , the digimon have the ability to evolve ( digivolve ) in this process , the digimon change appearance and become much stronger , often changing in personality as well . the group of children who come in contact with the digital world changes from series to series .
in a series of emergency meetings that lasted from 2-5 october , chinese leaders debated whether to send chinese troops into korea . there was considerable resistance among many leaders , including senior military leaders , to confronting the u.s. in korea . mao strongly supported intervention , and zhou was one of the few chinese leaders who firmly supported him . after lin biao politely refused mao 's offer to command chinese forces in korea ( citing his upcoming medical treatment ) , mao decided that peng dehuai would be the commander of the chinese forces in korea after peng agreed to support mao 's position . mao then asked peng to speak in favor of intervention to the rest of the chinese leaders . after peng made the case that if u.s. troops conquered korea and reached the yalu they might cross it and invade china the politburo agreed to intervene in korea . later , the chinese claimed that us bombers had violated prc national airspace on three separate occasions and attacked chinese targets before china intervened . on 8 october 1950 , mao zedong redesignated the pla north east frontier force as the chinese people 's volunteer army ( pva ) .
around 66 bc , a movement to use constitutional , or at least peaceful , means to address the plight of various classes began . after several failures , the movement 's leaders decided to use any means that were necessary to accomplish their goals . the movement coalesced under an aristocrat named lucius sergius catilina . the movement was based in the town of faesulae , which was a natural hotbed of agrarian agitation . the rural malcontents were to advance on rome , and be aided by an uprising within the city . after assassinating the consuls and most of the senators , catiline would be free to enact his reforms . the conspiracy was set in motion in 63 bc . the consul for the year , marcus tullius cicero , intercepted messages that catiline had sent in an attempt to recruit more members . as a result , the top conspirators in rome ( including at least one former consul ) were executed by authorisation ( of dubious constitutionality ) of the senate , and the planned uprising was disrupted . cicero then sent an army , which cut catiline 's forces to pieces .
in 1936 the us patent office declared bell first on its list of the country 's greatest inventors , leading to the us post office issuing a commemorative stamp honoring bell in 1940 as part of its ' famous americans series ' . the first day of issue ceremony was held on october 28 in boston , massachusetts , the city where bell spent considerable time on research and working with the deaf . the bell stamp became very popular and sold out in little time . the stamp became , and remains to this day , the most valuable one of the series .
euro1080 , a division of the former and now bankrupt belgian tv services company alfacam , broadcast hdtv channels to break the pan-european stalemate of " no hd broadcasts mean no hd tvs bought means no hd broadcasts ... " and kick-start hdtv interest in europe . the hd1 channel was initially free-to-air and mainly comprised sporting , dramatic , musical and other cultural events broadcast with a multi-lingual soundtrack on a rolling schedule of 4 or 5 hours per day .
during mutualistic symbioses , the host cell lacks some of the nutrients , which are provided by the endosymbiont . as a result , the host favors endosymbiont 's growth processes within itself by producing some specialized cells . these cells affect the genetic composition of the host in order to regulate the increasing population of the endosymbionts and ensuring that these genetic changes are passed onto the offspring via vertical transmission ( heredity ) .
in the early 1900s , james j. hill of the great northern began promoting settlement in the montana prairie to fill his trains with settlers and goods . other railroads followed suit . in 1902 , the reclamation act was passed , allowing irrigation projects to be built in montana 's eastern river valleys . in 1909 , congress passed the enlarged homestead act that expanded the amount of free land from 160 to 320 acres ( 0.6 to 1.3 km2 ) per family and in 1912 reduced the time to " prove up " on a claim to three years . in 1916 , the stock-raising homestead act allowed homesteads of 640 acres in areas unsuitable for irrigation . this combination of advertising and changes in the homestead act drew tens of thousands of homesteaders , lured by free land , with world war i bringing particularly high wheat prices . in addition , montana was going through a temporary period of higher-than-average precipitation . homesteaders arriving in this period were known as " honyockers , " or " scissorbills . " though the word " honyocker , " possibly derived from the ethnic slur " hunyak , " was applied in a derisive manner at homesteaders as being " greenhorns , " " new at his business " or " unprepared , " the reality was that a majority of these new settlers had previous farming experience , though there were also many who did not .
by the 12th century , romanesque architecture ( termed norman architecture in england because of its association with the norman invasion ) , was established throughout europe and provided the basic architectural forms and units that were to remain in evolution throughout the medieval period . the important categories of building : the cathedral church , the parish church , the monastery , the castle , the palace , the great hall , the gatehouse , the civic building , had been established in the romanesque period .

in 1996 , billboard created a new chart called adult top 40 , which reflects programming on radio stations that exists somewhere between " adult contemporary " music and " pop " music . although they are sometimes mistaken for each other , the adult contemporary chart and the adult top 40 chart are separate charts , and songs reaching one chart might not reach the other . in addition , hot ac is another subgenre of radio programming that is distinct from the hot adult contemporary tracks chart as it exists today , despite the apparent similarity in name .
opponents argue that the death penalty is not an effective means of deterring crime , risks the execution of the innocent , is unnecessarily barbaric in nature , cheapens human life , and puts a government on the same base moral level as those criminals involved in murder . furthermore , some opponents argue that the arbitrariness with which it is administered and the systemic influence of racial , socio-economic , geographic , and gender bias on determinations of desert make the current practice of capital punishment immoral and illegitimate .
game players were not the only ones to notice the violence in this game ; us senators herb kohl and joe lieberman convened a congressional hearing on december 9 , 1993 to investigate the marketing of violent video games to children . [ e ] while nintendo took the high ground with moderate success , the hearings led to the creation of the interactive digital software association and the entertainment software rating board , and the inclusion of ratings on all video games . with these ratings in place , nintendo decided its censorship policies were no longer needed .
in modern-day germany , the holy roman empire continued to rule , but the elective nature of the imperial crown meant there was no enduring dynasty around which a strong state could form . further east , the kingdoms of poland , hungary , and bohemia grew powerful . in iberia , the christian kingdoms continued to gain land from the muslim kingdoms of the peninsula ; portugal concentrated on expanding overseas during the 15th century , while the other kingdoms were riven by difficulties over royal succession and other concerns . after losing the hundred years ' war , england went on to suffer a long civil war known as the wars of the roses , which lasted into the 1490s and only ended when henry tudor ( r . 1485-1509 as henry vii ) became king and consolidated power with his victory over richard iii ( r . 1483-85 ) at bosworth in 1485 . in scandinavia , margaret i of denmark ( r. in denmark 1387-1412 ) consolidated norway , denmark , and sweden in the union of kalmar , which continued until 1523 . the major power around the baltic sea was the hanseatic league , a commercial confederation of city states that traded from western europe to russia . scotland emerged from english domination under robert the bruce ( r . 1306-29 ) , who secured papal recognition of his kingship in 1328 .
at the 2004 summer olympics , bermuda competed in sailing , athletics , swimming , diving , triathlon and equestrian events . in those olympics , bermuda 's katura horton-perinchief made history by becoming the first black female diver to compete in the olympic games . bermuda has had one olympic medallist , clarence hill , who won a bronze medal in boxing . bermuda also competed in men 's skeleton at the 2006 winter olympics in turin , italy . patrick singleton placed 19th , with a final time of 1 : 59.81 . jillian teceira competed in the beijing olympics in 2008 . it is tradition for bermuda to march in the opening ceremony in bermuda shorts , regardless of the summer or winter olympic celebration . bermuda also competes in the biennial island games , which it hosted in 2013 .
the football league was founded in 1888 , 16 years after the first fa cup competition . since the creation of the football league , tottenham hotspur is the only non-league " giant-killer " to win the cup , taking the 1901 fa cup with a victory over reigning league runners-up sheffield united : although at that time , there were only two divisions and 36 clubs in the football league , and spurs were champions of the next lowest football tier - the southern league and probably already good enough for the first division ( as was shown when they joined the second division in 1908 and immediately won promotion to the first . ) only two other actual non-league clubs have even reached the final since the founding of the league : sheffield wednesday in 1890 ( champions of the football alliance , a rival league which was already effectively the second division , which it formally became in 1892 - wednesday being let straight into the first division ) , and southampton in 1900 and 1902 ( in which years they were also southern league champions , proving the strength of that league : again , they were probably of equivalent standard to a first division club at the time , but southampton 's form subsequently faded and they did not join the league till 1920 and the formation of the third division . )
rapid environmental changes typically cause mass extinctions . more than 99 percent of all species , amounting to over five billion species , that ever lived on earth are estimated to be extinct . estimates on the number of earth 's current species range from 10 million to 14 million , of which about 1.2 million have been documented and over 86 percent have not yet been described . the total amount of related dna base pairs on earth is estimated at 5.0 x 1037 , and weighs 50 billion tonnes . in comparison , the total mass of the biosphere has been estimated to be as much as 4 ttc ( trillion tons of carbon ) .
the city of oklahoma city has operated under a council-manager form of city government since 1927 . mick cornett serves as mayor , having first been elected in 2004 , and re-elected in 2006 , 2010 , and 2014 . eight councilpersons represent each of the eight wards of oklahoma city . city manager jim couch was appointed in late 2000 . couch previously served as assistant city manager , metropolitan area projects plan ( maps ) director and utilities director prior to his service as city manager .
flower evolution continues to the present day ; modern flowers have been so profoundly influenced by humans that some of them cannot be pollinated in nature . many modern domesticated flower species were formerly simple weeds , which sprouted only when the ground was disturbed . some of them tended to grow with human crops , perhaps already having symbiotic companion plant relationships with them , and the prettiest did not get plucked because of their beauty , developing a dependence upon and special adaptation to human affection .
an article in science suggested that the construction and filling of the zipingpu dam may have triggered the earthquake . the chief engineer of the sichuan geology and mineral bureau said that the sudden shift of a huge quantity of water into the region could have relaxed the tension between the two sides of the fault , allowing them to move apart , and could have increased the direct pressure on it , causing a violent rupture . the effect was " 25 times more " than a year 's worth of natural stress from tectonic movement . the government had disregarded warnings about so many large-scale dam projects in a seismically active area . researchers have been denied access to seismological and geological data to examine the cause of the quake further .
the 1960s was a significant decade for iranian cinema , with 25 commercial films produced annually on average throughout the early 60s , increasing to 65 by the end of the decade . the majority of production focused on melodrama and thrillers . with the screening of the films kaiser and the cow , directed by masoud kimiai and dariush mehrjui respectively in 1969 , alternative films established their status in the film industry . attempts to organize a film festival that had begun in 1954 within the framework of the golrizan festival , bore fruits in the form of the sepas festival in 1969 . the endeavors also resulted in the formation of the tehran world festival in 1973 .
predominantly christian , the population of st. john 's was once divided along sectarian ( catholic / protestant ) lines . in recent years , this sectarianism has declined significantly , and is no longer a commonly acknowledged facet of life in st. john 's . st. john 's is the seat of the roman catholic archbishop of st. john 's , and the anglican bishop of eastern newfoundland and labrador . all major christian sects showed a decline from 2001-2011 with a large increase in those with no religion from 3.9 % to 11.1 % .
grey-box testing ( american spelling : gray-box testing ) involves having knowledge of internal data structures and algorithms for purposes of designing tests , while executing those tests at the user , or black-box level . the tester is not required to have full access to the software 's source code . [ not in citation given ] manipulating input data and formatting output do not qualify as grey-box , because the input and output are clearly outside of the " black box " that we are calling the system under test . this distinction is particularly important when conducting integration testing between two modules of code written by two different developers , where only the interfaces are exposed for test .
modern geology , like modern chemistry , gradually evolved during the 18th and early 19th centuries . benoit de maillet and the comte de buffon saw the earth as much older than the 6,000 years envisioned by biblical scholars . jean-etienne guettard and nicolas desmarest hiked central france and recorded their observations on some of the first geological maps . aided by chemical experimentation , naturalists such as scotland 's john walker , sweden 's torbern bergman , and germany 's abraham werner created comprehensive classification systems for rocks and minerals - a collective achievement that transformed geology into a cutting edge field by the end of the eighteenth century . these early geologists also proposed a generalized interpretations of earth history that led james hutton , georges cuvier and alexandre brongniart , following in the steps of steno , to argue that layers of rock could be dated by the fossils they contained : a principle first applied to the geology of the paris basin . the use of index fossils became a powerful tool for making geological maps , because it allowed geologists to correlate the rocks in one locality with those of similar age in other , distant localities . over the first half of the 19th century , geologists such as charles lyell , adam sedgwick , and roderick murchison applied the new technique to rocks throughout europe and eastern north america , setting the stage for more detailed , government-funded mapping projects in later decades .
in han government , the emperor was the supreme judge and lawgiver , the commander-in-chief of the armed forces and sole designator of official nominees appointed to the top posts in central and local administrations ; those who earned a 600-dan salary-rank or higher . theoretically , there were no limits to his power . however , state organs with competing interests and institutions such as the court conference ( tingyi 廷議 ) - where ministers were convened to reach majority consensus on an issue - pressured the emperor to accept the advice of his ministers on policy decisions . if the emperor rejected a court conference decision , he risked alienating his high ministers . nevertheless , emperors sometimes did reject the majority opinion reached at court conferences .
the fbi director is responsible for the day-to-day operations at the fbi . along with his deputies , the director makes sure cases and operations are handled correctly . the director also is in charge of making sure the leadership in any one of the fbi field offices is manned with qualified agents . before the intelligence reform and terrorism prevention act was passed in the wake of the september 11 attacks , the fbi director would directly brief the president of the united states on any issues that arise from within the fbi . since then , the director now reports to the director of national intelligence ( dni ) , who in turn reports to the president .
because most injuries sustained by adolescents are related to risky behavior ( car crashes , alcohol , unprotected sex ) , a great deal of research has been done on the cognitive and emotional processes underlying adolescent risk-taking . in addressing this question , it is important to distinguish whether adolescents are more likely to engage in risky behaviors ( prevalence ) , whether they make risk-related decisions similarly or differently than adults ( cognitive processing perspective ) , or whether they use the same processes but value different things and thus arrive at different conclusions . the behavioral decision-making theory proposes that adolescents and adults both weigh the potential rewards and consequences of an action . however , research has shown that adolescents seem to give more weight to rewards , particularly social rewards , than do adults .
in 1938 the nazis altered about one-third of the toponyms of the area , eliminating , germanizing , or simplifying a number of old prussian names , as well as those polish or lithuanian names originating from colonists and refugees to prussia during and after the protestant reformation . more than 1,500 places were ordered to be renamed by 16 july 1938 following a decree issued by gauleiter and oberprasident erich koch and initiated by adolf hitler . many who would not cooperate with the rulers of nazi germany were sent to concentration camps and held prisoner there until their death or liberation .
charlemagne 's expansion of the frankish empire around 800 , including northern italy and rome , brought on a brief period of stability and unity in francia . this created opportunities for jewish merchants to settle again north of the alps . charlemagne granted the jews freedoms similar to those once enjoyed under the roman empire . in addition , jews from southern italy , fleeing religious persecution , began to move into central europe . [ citation needed ] returning to frankish lands , many jewish merchants took up occupations in finance and commerce , including money lending , or usury . ( church legislation banned christians from lending money in exchange for interest . ) from charlemagne 's time to the present , jewish life in northern europe is well documented . by the 11th century , when rashi of troyes wrote his commentaries , jews in what came to be known as " ashkenaz " were known for their halakhic learning , and talmudic studies . they were criticized by sephardim and other jewish scholars in islamic lands for their lack of expertise in jewish jurisprudence ( dinim ) and general ignorance of hebrew linguistics and literature . yiddish emerged as a result of language contact with various high german vernaculars in the medieval period . it was written with hebrew letters , and heavily influenced by hebrew and aramaic .
years later , kaunitz kept trying to establish france 's alliance with austria . he tried as hard as he could for austria to not get entangled in hanover 's political affairs , and was even willing to trade austrian netherlands for france 's aid in recapturing silesia . frustrated by this decision and by the dutch republic 's insistence on neutrality , britain soon turned to russia . on september 30 , 1755 , britain pledged financial aid to russia in order to station 50,000 troops on the livonian-lithunian border , so they could defend britain 's interests in hanover immediately . besthuzev , assuming the preparation was directed against prussia , was more than happy to obey the request of the british . unbeknownst to the other powers , king george ii also made overtures to the prussian king ; frederick , who began fearing the austro-russian intentions , and was excited to welcome a rapprochement with britain . on january 16 , 1756 , the convention of westminster was signed wherein britain and prussia promised to aid one another in order to achieve lasting peace and stability in europe .
in addition to the dead and wounded , government leaders feared mass psychological trauma from aerial attack and a resulting collapse of civil society . a committee of psychiatrists reported to the government in 1938 that there would be three times as many mental as physical casualties from aerial bombing , implying three to four million psychiatric patients . winston churchill told parliament in 1934 , " we must expect that , under the pressure of continuous attack upon london , at least three or four million people would be driven out into the open country around the metropolis . " panicked reactions during the munich crisis , such as the migration by 150,000 to wales , contributed to fear of societal chaos .

"
most copper is mined or extracted as copper sulfides from large open pit mines in porphyry copper deposits that contain 0.4 to 1.0 % copper . examples include chuquicamata in chile , bingham canyon mine in utah , united states and el chino mine in new mexico , united states . according to the british geological survey , in 2005 , chile was the top mine producer of copper with at least one-third world share followed by the united states , indonesia and peru . copper can also be recovered through the in-situ leach process . several sites in the state of arizona are considered prime candidates for this method . the amount of copper in use is increasing and the quantity available is barely sufficient to allow all countries to reach developed world levels of usage .
there are many hokkien speakers among overseas chinese in southeast asia as well as in the united states . many ethnic han chinese emigrants to the region were hoklo from southern fujian , and brought the language to what is now burma ( myanmar ) , indonesia ( the former dutch east indies ) and present day malaysia and singapore ( formerly malaya and the british straits settlements ) . many of the hokkien dialects of this region are highly similar to taiwanese and amoy . hokkien is reportedly the native language of up to 98.5 % of the chinese filipino in the philippines , among which is known locally as lan-nang or lan-lang-oe ( " our people 's language " ) . hokkien speakers form the largest group of chinese in singapore , malaysia and indonesia .

for nearly 2000 years , sanskrit was the language of a cultural order that exerted influence across south asia , inner asia , southeast asia , and to a certain extent east asia . a significant form of post-vedic sanskrit is found in the sanskrit of indian epic poetry - the ramayana and mahabharata . the deviations from panini in the epics are generally considered to be on account of interference from prakrits , or innovations , and not because they are pre-paninian . traditional sanskrit scholars call such deviations arsa ( आर  ष ) , meaning ' of the rsis ' , the traditional title for the ancient authors . in some contexts , there are also more " prakritisms " ( borrowings from common speech ) than in classical sanskrit proper . buddhist hybrid sanskrit is a literary language heavily influenced by the middle indo-aryan languages , based on early buddhist prakrit texts which subsequently assimilated to the classical sanskrit standard in varying degrees .
others have rejected that the doctrine of immaculate conception exists in islam , the quranic account does not confirm the immaculate conception exclusively for mary as in islam every human child is born pure and immaculate , her sinless birth is thus independent of the christian docrtrine of original sin as no such doctrine exists in islam . moreover , hannah 's prayer in the quran for her child to remain protected from satan ( shaytan ) was said after it had already been born , not before and expresses a natural concern any righteous parent would have . the muslim tradition or hadith , which states that the only children born without the " touch of satan , " were mary and jesus. should therefore not be taken in isolation from the quran , and is to be interpreted within the specific context of exonerating mary and her child from the charges that were made against them and is not a general statement . the specific mention of mary and jesus in this hadith may also be taken to represent a class of people , in keeping with the arabic language and the quranic verse [ o satan ] surely thou shalt have no power over my servants , except such of the erring ones as choose to follow thee ( 15 : 42 )

the administrator of prussia , the grandmaster of the teutonic order maximilian iii , son of emperor maximilian ii died in 1618 . when maximilian died , albert 's line died out , and the duchy of prussia passed to the electors of brandenburg , forming brandenburg-prussia . taking advantage of the swedish invasion of poland in 1655 , and instead of fulfilling his vassal 's duties towards the polish kingdom , by joining forces with the swedes and subsequent treaties of wehlau , labiau , and oliva , elector and duke frederick william succeeded in revoking king of poland 's sovereignty over the duchy of prussia in 1660 . the absolutist elector also subdued the noble estates of prussia .
by 1990 , the census bureau included more than a dozen ethnic / racial categories on the census , reflecting not only changing social ideas about ethnicity , but the wide variety of immigrants who had come to reside in the united states due to changing historical forces and new immigration laws in the 1960s . with a changing society , more citizens have begun to press for acknowledging multiracial ancestry . the census bureau changed its data collection by allowing people to self-identify as more than one ethnicity . some ethnic groups are concerned about the potential political and economic effects , as federal assistance to historically underserved groups has depended on census data . according to the census bureau , as of 2002 , over 75 % of all african americans had multiracial ancestries .
beginning in the late 1950s and 1960s , architectural phenomenology emerged as an important movement in the early reaction against modernism , with architects like charles moore in the usa , christian norberg-schulz in norway , and ernesto nathan rogers and vittorio gregotti in italy , who collectively popularized an interest in a new contemporary architecture aimed at expanding human experience using historical buildings as models and precedents . postmodernism produced a style that combined contemporary building technology and cheap materials , with the aesthetics of older pre-modern and non-modern styles , from high classical architecture to popular or vernacular regional building styles . robert venturi famously defined postmodern architecture as a " decorated shed " ( an ordinary building which is functionally designed inside and embellished on the outside ) , and upheld it against modernist and brutalist " ducks " ( buildings with unnecessarily expressive tectonic forms ) .
there are a number of radio news agencies based in somalia . established during the colonial period , radio mogadishu initially broadcast news items in both somali and italian . the station was modernized with russian assistance following independence in 1960 , and began offering home service in somali , amharic and oromo . after closing down operations in the early 1990s due to the civil war , the station was officially re-opened in the early 2000s by the transitional national government . in the late 2000s , radio mogadishu also launched a complementary website of the same name , with news items in somali , arabic and english .
miami is noted as " the only major city in the united states conceived by a woman , julia tuttle , " a local citrus grower and a wealthy cleveland native . the miami area was better known as " biscayne bay country " in the early years of its growth . in the late 19th century , reports described the area as a promising wilderness . the area was also characterized as " one of the finest building sites in florida . " the great freeze of 1894-95 hastened miami 's growth , as the crops of the miami area were the only ones in florida that survived . julia tuttle subsequently convinced henry flagler , a railroad tycoon , to expand his florida east coast railway to the region , for which she became known as " the mother of miami . " miami was officially incorporated as a city on july 28 , 1896 with a population of just over 300 . it was named for the nearby miami river , derived from mayaimi , the historic name of lake okeechobee .
article 10 of the berne convention mandates that national laws provide for limitations to copyright , so that copyright protection does not extend to certain kinds of uses that fall under what the treaty calls " fair practice , " including but not limited to minimal quotations used in journalism and education . the laws implementing these limitations and exceptions for uses that would otherwise be infringing broadly fall into the categories of either fair use or fair dealing . in common law systems , these fair practice statutes typically enshrine principles underlying many earlier judicial precedents , and are considered essential to freedom of speech .
the zipingpu hydropower plant ( simplified chinese : 紫坪铺水库 ; traditional chinese : 紫坪鋪水庫 ) located 20 km east of the epicenter was damaged . a recent inspection indicated that the damage was less severe than initially feared , and it remains structurally stable and safe . the tulong reservoir upstream is in danger of collapse . about 2,000 troops have been allocated to zipingpu , trying to release the pressure through spillway . in total , 391 dams , most of them small , were reported damaged by the quake .
at the start of her reign victoria was popular , but her reputation suffered in an 1839 court intrigue when one of her mother 's ladies-in-waiting , lady flora hastings , developed an abdominal growth that was widely rumoured to be an out-of-wedlock pregnancy by sir john conroy . victoria believed the rumours . she hated conroy , and despised " that odious lady flora , " because she had conspired with conroy and the duchess of kent in the kensington system . at first , lady flora refused to submit to a naked medical examination , until in mid-february she eventually agreed , and was found to be a virgin . conroy , the hastings family and the opposition tories organised a press campaign implicating the queen in the spreading of false rumours about lady flora . when lady flora died in july , the post-mortem revealed a large tumour on her liver that had distended her abdomen . at public appearances , victoria was hissed and jeered as " mrs. melbourne . "

migrating birds can lose their way and appear outside their normal ranges . this can be due to flying past their destinations as in the " spring overshoot " in which birds returning to their breeding areas overshoot and end up further north than intended . certain areas , because of their location , have become famous as watchpoints for such birds . examples are the point pelee national park in canada , and spurn in england .
there has been a football tournament at every summer olympic games since 1900 , except at the 1932 games in los angeles . before the inception of the world cup , the olympics ( especially during the 1920s ) had the same status as the world cup . originally , the event was for amateurs only ; however , since the 1984 summer olympics , professional players have been permitted , albeit with certain restrictions which prevent countries from fielding their strongest sides . the olympic men 's tournament is played at under-23 level . in the past the olympics have allowed a restricted number of over-age players per team . a women 's tournament was added in 1996 ; in contrast to the men 's event , full international sides without age restrictions play the women 's olympic tournament .
after the capitulation of axis forces in north africa , eisenhower oversaw the highly successful invasion of sicily . once mussolini , the italian leader , had fallen in italy , the allies switched their attention to the mainland with operation avalanche . but while eisenhower argued with president roosevelt and british prime minister churchill , who both insisted on unconditional terms of surrender in exchange for helping the italians , the germans pursued an aggressive buildup of forces in the country - making the job more difficult , by adding 19 divisions and initially outnumbering the allied forces 2 to 1 ; nevertheless , the invasion of italy was highly successful .
the first half of the 14th century saw much important scientific work being done , largely within the framework of scholastic commentaries on aristotle 's scientific writings . william of ockham introduced the principle of parsimony : natural philosophers should not postulate unnecessary entities , so that motion is not a distinct thing but is only the moving object and an intermediary " sensible species " is not needed to transmit an image of an object to the eye . scholars such as jean buridan and nicole oresme started to reinterpret elements of aristotle 's mechanics . in particular , buridan developed the theory that impetus was the cause of the motion of projectiles , which was a first step towards the modern concept of inertia . the oxford calculators began to mathematically analyze the kinematics of motion , making this analysis without considering the causes of motion .
during the 1950s and 1960s , fbi officials became increasingly concerned about the influence of civil rights leaders , whom they believed had communist ties or were unduly influenced by them . in 1956 , for example , hoover sent an open letter denouncing dr. t.r.m. howard , a civil rights leader , surgeon , and wealthy entrepreneur in mississippi who had criticized fbi inaction in solving recent murders of george w. lee , emmett till , and other blacks in the south . the fbi carried out controversial domestic surveillance in an operation it called the cointelpro , which was short for " counter-intelligence program . " it was to investigate and disrupt the activities of dissident political organizations within the united states , including both militant and non-violent organizations . among its targets was the southern christian leadership conference , a leading civil rights organization with clergy leadership .
the emergence of resistance of bacteria to antibiotics is a common phenomenon . emergence of resistance often reflects evolutionary processes that take place during antibiotic therapy . the antibiotic treatment may select for bacterial strains with physiologically or genetically enhanced capacity to survive high doses of antibiotics . under certain conditions , it may result in preferential growth of resistant bacteria , while growth of susceptible bacteria is inhibited by the drug . for example , antibacterial selection for strains having previously acquired antibacterial-resistance genes was demonstrated in 1943 by the luria-delbruck experiment . antibiotics such as penicillin and erythromycin , which used to have a high efficacy against many bacterial species and strains , have become less effective , due to the increased resistance of many bacterial strains .
the road to yorktown and america 's independence from great britain led through north carolina . as the british army moved north from victories in charleston and camden , south carolina , the southern division of the continental army and local militia prepared to meet them . following general daniel morgan 's victory over the british cavalry commander banastre tarleton at the battle of cowpens on january 17 , 1781 , southern commander nathanael greene led british lord charles cornwallis across the heartland of north carolina , and away from the latter 's base of supply in charleston , south carolina . this campaign is known as " the race to the dan " or " the race for the river . "
youtube relies on its users to flag the content of videos as inappropriate , and a youtube employee will view a flagged video to determine whether it violates the site 's terms of service . in july 2008 , the culture and media committee of the house of commons of the united kingdom stated that it was " unimpressed " with youtube 's system for policing its videos , and argued that " proactive review of content should be standard practice for sites hosting user-generated content . " youtube responded by stating :
the assumption that black-body radiation is thermal leads to an accurate prediction : the total amount of emitted energy goes up with the temperature according to a definite rule , the stefan-boltzmann law ( 1879-84 ) . but it was also known that the colour of the light given off by a hot object changes with the temperature , so that " white hot " is hotter than " red hot . " nevertheless , wilhelm wien discovered the mathematical relationship between the peaks of the curves at different temperatures , by using the principle of adiabatic invariance . at each different temperature , the curve is moved over by wien 's displacement law ( 1893 ) . wien also proposed an approximation for the spectrum of the object , which was correct at high frequencies ( short wavelength ) but not at low frequencies ( long wavelength ) . it still was not clear why the spectrum of a hot object had the form that it has ( see diagram ) .
ipods have won several awards ranging from engineering excellence , [ not in citation given ] to most innovative audio product , to fourth best computer product of 2006. ipods often receive favorable reviews ; scoring on looks , clean design , and ease of use . pc world says that ipod line has " altered the landscape for portable audio players . " several industries are modifying their products to work better with both the ipod line and the aac audio format . examples include cd copy-protection schemes , and mobile phones , such as phones from sony ericsson and nokia , which play aac files rather than wma .
the easternmost section , about 10 miles ( 16 km ) in width , consists of hilly land that runs along the western bank of the tennessee river . to the west of this narrow strip of land is a wide area of rolling hills and streams that stretches all the way to the mississippi river ; this area is called the tennessee bottoms or bottom land . in memphis , the tennessee bottoms end in steep bluffs overlooking the river . to the west of the tennessee bottoms is the mississippi alluvial plain , less than 300 feet ( 90 m ) above sea level . this area of lowlands , flood plains , and swamp land is sometimes referred to as the delta region . memphis is the economic center of west tennessee and the largest city in the state .
nearly all beer includes barley malt as the majority of the starch . this is because its fibrous hull remains attached to the grain during threshing . after malting , barley is milled , which finally removes the hull , breaking it into large pieces . these pieces remain with the grain during the mash , and act as a filter bed during lautering , when sweet wort is separated from insoluble grain material . other malted and unmalted grains ( including wheat , rice , oats , and rye , and less frequently , corn and sorghum ) may be used . some brewers have produced gluten-free beer , made with sorghum with no barley malt , for those who cannot consume gluten-containing grains like wheat , barley , and rye .
the aeronautics branch was renamed the bureau of air commerce in 1934 to reflect its enhanced status within the department . as commercial flying increased , the bureau encouraged a group of airlines to establish the first three centers for providing air traffic control ( atc ) along the airways . in 1936 , the bureau itself took over the centers and began to expand the atc system . the pioneer air traffic controllers used maps , blackboards , and mental calculations to ensure the safe separation of aircraft traveling along designated routes between cities .
economic sanctions against iran , such as the embargo against iranian crude oil , have affected the economy . sanctions have led to a steep fall in the value of the rial , and as of april 2013 one us dollar is worth 36,000 rial , compared with 16,000 in early 2012 . following a successful implementation of the 2015 nuclear and sanctions relief deal , the resulting benefits might not be distributed evenly across the iranian economy as political elites such as the islamic revolutionary guard corps have garnered more resources and economic interests .
double fertilization refers to a process in which two sperm cells fertilize cells in the ovary . this process begins when a pollen grain adheres to the stigma of the pistil ( female reproductive structure ) , germinates , and grows a long pollen tube . while this pollen tube is growing , a haploid generative cell travels down the tube behind the tube nucleus . the generative cell divides by mitosis to produce two haploid ( n ) sperm cells . as the pollen tube grows , it makes its way from the stigma , down the style and into the ovary . here the pollen tube reaches the micropyle of the ovule and digests its way into one of the synergids , releasing its contents ( which include the sperm cells ) . the synergid that the cells were released into degenerates and one sperm makes its way to fertilize the egg cell , producing a diploid ( 2n ) zygote . the second sperm cell fuses with both central cell nuclei , producing a triploid ( 3n ) cell . as the zygote develops into an embryo , the triploid cell develops into the endosperm , which serves as the embryo 's food supply . the ovary now will develop into fruit and the ovule will develop into seed .
in addition to singing words , some a cappella singers also emulate instrumentation by reproducing instrumental sounds with their vocal cords and mouth . one of the earliest 20th century practitioners of this method were the mills brothers whose early recordings of the 1930s clearly stated on the label that all instrumentation was done vocally . more recently , " twilight zone " by 2 unlimited was sung a cappella to the instrumentation on the comedy television series tompkins square . another famous example of emulating instrumentation instead of singing the words is the theme song for the new addams family series on fox family channel ( now abc family ) . groups such as vocal sampling and undivided emulate latin rhythms a cappella . in the 1960s , the swingle singers used their voices to emulate musical instruments to baroque and classical music . vocal artist bobby mcferrin is famous for his instrumental emulation . a cappella group naturally seven recreates entire songs using vocal tones for every instrument .
during the hundred years ' war , the army of the duke of burgundy and a force of about two hundred english soldiers occupied paris from may 1420 until 1436 . they repelled an attempt by joan of arc to liberate the city in 1429 . a century later , during the french wars of religion , paris was a stronghold of the catholic league . on 24 august 1572 , paris was the site of the st. bartholomew 's day massacre , when thousands of french protestants were killed . the last of these wars , the eighth one , ended in 1594 , after henri iv had converted to catholicism and was finally able to enter paris as he supposedly declared paris vaut bien une messe ( " paris is well worth a mass " ) . the city had been neglected for decades ; by the time of his assassination in 1610 , henry iv had rebuilt the pont neuf , the first paris bridge with sidewalks and not lined with buildings , linked with a new wing the louvre to the tuileries palace , and created the first paris residential square , the place royale , now place des vosges .
the salivary glands ( element 30 in numbered diagram ) in an insect 's mouth produce saliva . the salivary ducts lead from the glands to the reservoirs and then forward through the head to an opening called the salivarium , located behind the hypopharynx . by moving its mouthparts ( element 32 in numbered diagram ) the insect can mix its food with saliva . the mixture of saliva and food then travels through the salivary tubes into the mouth , where it begins to break down . some insects , like flies , have extra-oral digestion . insects using extra-oral digestion expel digestive enzymes onto their food to break it down . this strategy allows insects to extract a significant proportion of the available nutrients from the food source . : 31 the gut is where almost all of insects ' digestion takes place . it can be divided into the foregut , midgut and hindgut .
men typically wore a toga , and women a stola . the woman 's stola differed in looks from a toga , and was usually brightly coloured . the cloth and the dress distinguished one class of people from the other class . the tunic worn by plebeians , or common people , like shepherds and slaves , was made from coarse and dark material , whereas the tunic worn by patricians was of linen or white wool . a knight or magistrate would wear an augusticlavus , a tunic bearing small purple studs . senators wore tunics with broad red stripes , called tunica laticlavia . military tunics were shorter than the ones worn by civilians . boys , up until the festival of liberalia , wore the toga praetexta , which was a toga with a crimson or purple border . the toga virilis , ( or toga pura ) was worn by men over the age of 16 to signify their citizenship in rome . the toga picta was worn by triumphant generals and had embroidery of their skill on the battlefield . the toga pulla was worn when in mourning .

several prominent american literary figures lived in new york during the 1830s and 1840s , including william cullen bryant , washington irving , herman melville , rufus wilmot griswold , john keese , nathaniel parker willis , and edgar allan poe . public-minded members of the contemporaneous business elite lobbied for the establishment of central park , which in 1857 became the first landscaped park in an american city .
korean presbyterian denominations are active in evangelism and many of its missionaries are being sent overseas , being the second biggest missionary sender in the world after the united states . gsm , the missionary body of the " hapdong " general assembly of presbyterian churches of korea , is the single largest presbyterian missionary organization in korea . in addition there are many korean-american presbyterians in the united states , either with their own church sites or sharing space in pre-existing churches as is the case in australia , new zealand and even muslim countries such as saudi arabia with korean immigration .
in india , the longest constitutional text in the history of the world has governed that country since 1950 . although the constitution of india may have been intended to provide details that would limit the opportunity for judicial discretion , the more text there is in a constitution the greater opportunity the judiciary may have to exercise judicial review . according to indian journalist harish khare , " the rule of law or rather the constitution [ is ] in danger of being supplanted by the rule of judges . "
the alma-ata protocol also addressed other issues , including un membership . notably , russia was authorized to assume the soviet union 's un membership , including its permanent seat on the security council . the soviet ambassador to the un delivered a letter signed by russian president yeltsin to the un secretary-general dated december 24 , 1991 , informing him that by virtue of the alma-ata protocol , russia was the successor state to the ussr . after being circulated among the other un member states , with no objection raised , the statement was declared accepted on the last day of the year , december 31 , 1991 .
early civilisations in myanmar included the tibeto-burman-speaking pyu city-states in upper burma and the mon kingdoms in lower burma . in the 9th century , the bamar people entered the upper irrawaddy valley and , following the establishment of the pagan kingdom in the 1050s , the burmese language , culture and theravada buddhism slowly became dominant in the country . the pagan kingdom fell due to the mongol invasions and several warring states emerged . in the 16th century , reunified by the taungoo dynasty , the country was for a brief period the largest empire in the history of southeast asia . the early 19th century konbaung dynasty ruled over an area that included modern myanmar and briefly controlled manipur and assam as well . the british conquered myanmar after three anglo-burmese wars in the 19th century and the country became a british colony . myanmar became an independent nation in 1948 , initially as a democratic nation and then , following a coup d 'etat in 1962 , a military dictatorship .
estonia has pursued the development of the e-state and e-government . internet voting is used in elections in estonia . the first internet voting took place in the 2005 local elections and the first in a parliamentary election was made available for the 2007 elections , in which 30,275 individuals voted over the internet . voters have a chance to invalidate their electronic vote in traditional elections , if they wish to . in 2009 in its eighth worldwide press freedom index , reporters without borders ranked estonia sixth out of 175 countries . in the first ever state of world liberty index report , estonia was ranked first out of 159 countries .
jesuit missionary eusebio francisco kino visited the santa cruz river valley in 1692 , and founded the mission san xavier del bac in 1700 about 7 mi ( 11 km ) upstream from the site of the settlement of tucson . a separate convento settlement was founded downstream along the santa cruz river , near the base of what is now " a " mountain . hugo o 'conor , the founding father of the city of tucson , arizona authorized the construction of a military fort in that location , presidio san agustin del tucson , on august 20 , 1775 ( near the present downtown pima county courthouse ) . during the spanish period of the presidio , attacks such as the second battle of tucson were repeatedly mounted by apaches . eventually the town came to be called " tucson " and became a part of sonora after mexico gained independence from spain in 1821 .
this is not to say that whitehead 's thought was widely accepted or even well-understood . his philosophical work is generally considered to be among the most difficult to understand in all of the western canon . even professional philosophers struggled to follow whitehead 's writings . one famous story illustrating the level of difficulty of whitehead 's philosophy centers around the delivery of whitehead 's gifford lectures in 1927-28 - following arthur eddington 's lectures of the year previous - which whitehead would later publish as process and reality :
in theravada buddhism , the cause of human existence and suffering is identified as craving , which carries with it the various defilements . these various defilements are traditionally summed up as greed , hatred and delusion . these are believed deeply rooted afflictions of the mind that create suffering and stress . to be free from suffering and stress , these defilements must be permanently uprooted through internal investigation , analyzing , experiencing , and understanding of the true nature of those defilements by using jhana , a technique of the noble eightfold path . it then leads the meditator to realize the four noble truths , enlightenment and nibbana . nibbana is the ultimate goal of theravadins .

sociocultural anthropology draws together the principle axes of cultural anthropology and social anthropology . cultural anthropology is the comparative study of the manifold ways in which people make sense of the world around them , while social anthropology is the study of the relationships among persons and groups . cultural anthropology is more related to philosophy , literature and the arts ( how one 's culture affects experience for self and group , contributing to more complete understanding of the people 's knowledge , customs , and institutions ) , while social anthropology is more related to sociology and history. in that it helps develop understanding of social structures , typically of others and other populations ( such as minorities , subgroups , dissidents , etc . ) . there is no hard-and-fast distinction between them , and these categories overlap to a considerable degree .
in june 2007 , youtube began trials of a system for automatic detection of uploaded videos that infringe copyright . google ceo eric schmidt regarded this system as necessary for resolving lawsuits such as the one from viacom , which alleged that youtube profited from content that it did not have the right to distribute . the system , which became known as content id , creates an id file for copyrighted audio and video material , and stores it in a database . when a video is uploaded , it is checked against the database , and flags the video as a copyright violation if a match is found .
the crusaders consolidated their conquests into crusader states . during the 12th and 13th centuries , there were a series of conflicts between those states and the surrounding islamic states . appeals from those states to the papacy led to further crusades , such as the third crusade , called to try to regain jerusalem , which had been captured by saladin ( d . 1193 ) in 1187 . [ z ] in 1203 , the fourth crusade was diverted from the holy land to constantinople , and captured the city in 1204 , setting up a latin empire of constantinople and greatly weakening the byzantine empire . the byzantines recaptured the city in 1261 , but never regained their former strength . by 1291 all the crusader states had been captured or forced from the mainland , although a titular kingdom of jerusalem survived on the island of cyprus for several years afterwards .
xalwo ( halva ) is a popular confection eaten during festive occasions , such as eid celebrations or wedding receptions . it is made from sugar , corn starch , cardamom powder , nutmeg powder and ghee . peanuts are also sometimes added to enhance texture and flavor . after meals , homes are traditionally perfumed using frankincense ( lubaan ) or incense ( cuunsi ) , which is prepared inside an incense burner referred to as a dabqaad .
traditional willow growing and weaving ( such as basket weaving ) is not as extensive as it used to be but is still carried out on the somerset levels and is commemorated at the willows and wetlands visitor centre . fragments of willow basket were found near the glastonbury lake village , and it was also used in the construction of several iron age causeways . the willow was harvested using a traditional method of pollarding , where a tree would be cut back to the main stem . during the 1930s more than 3,600 hectares ( 8,900 acres ) of willow were being grown commercially on the levels . largely due to the displacement of baskets with plastic bags and cardboard boxes , the industry has severely declined since the 1950s . by the end of the 20th century only about 140 hectares ( 350 acres ) were grown commercially , near the villages of burrowbridge , westonzoyland and north curry . the somerset levels is now the only area in the uk where basket willow is grown commercially .
on 22 september 2003 the newspaper appeared to misjudge the public mood surrounding mental health , as well as its affection for former world heavyweight champion boxer frank bruno , who had been admitted to hospital , when the headline " bonkers bruno locked up " appeared on the front page of early editions . the adverse reaction , once the paper had hit the streets on the evening of 21 september , led to the headline being changed for the paper 's second edition to the more sympathetic " sad bruno in mental home . "
paraplegia , the loss of sensation and voluntary motor control after serious spinal cord damage , may be accompanied by girdle pain at the level of the spinal cord damage , visceral pain evoked by a filling bladder or bowel , or , in five to ten per cent of paraplegics , phantom body pain in areas of complete sensory loss . this phantom body pain is initially described as burning or tingling but may evolve into severe crushing or pinching pain , or the sensation of fire running down the legs or of a knife twisting in the flesh . onset may be immediate or may not occur until years after the disabling injury . surgical treatment rarely provides lasting relief .
the last glacial period of the current ice age ended about 10,000 years ago . ice melt caused world sea levels to rise about 35 metres ( 115 ft ) in the early part of the holocene . in addition , many areas above about 40 degrees north latitude had been depressed by the weight of the pleistocene glaciers and rose as much as 180 metres ( 591 ft ) over the late pleistocene and holocene , and are still rising today . the sea level rise and temporary land depression allowed temporary marine incursions into areas that are now far from the sea . holocene marine fossils are known from vermont , quebec , ontario and michigan . other than higher latitude temporary marine incursions associated with glacial depression , holocene fossils are found primarily in lakebed , floodplain and cave deposits . holocene marine deposits along low-latitude coastlines are rare because the rise in sea levels during the period exceeds any likely upthrusting of non-glacial origin . post-glacial rebound in scandinavia resulted in the emergence of coastal areas around the baltic sea , including much of finland . the region continues to rise , still causing weak earthquakes across northern europe . the equivalent event in north america was the rebound of hudson bay , as it shrank from its larger , immediate post-glacial tyrrell sea phase , to near its present boundaries .
incandescent light bulbs consist of an air-tight glass enclosure ( the envelope , or bulb ) with a filament of tungsten wire inside the bulb , through which an electric current is passed . contact wires and a base with two ( or more ) conductors provide electrical connections to the filament . incandescent light bulbs usually contain a stem or glass mount anchored to the bulb 's base that allows the electrical contacts to run through the envelope without air or gas leaks . small wires embedded in the stem in turn support the filament and its lead wires .
the allied disaster at austerlitz significantly shook the faith of emperor francis in the british-led war effort . france and austria agreed to an armistice immediately and the treaty of pressburg followed shortly after on 26 december . pressburg took austria out of both the war and the coalition while reinforcing the earlier treaties of campo formio and of luneville between the two powers . the treaty confirmed the austrian loss of lands to france in italy and bavaria , and lands in germany to napoleon 's german allies . it also imposed an indemnity of 40 million francs on the defeated habsburgs and allowed the fleeing russian troops free passage through hostile territories and back to their home soil . napoleon went on to say , " the battle of austerlitz is the finest of all i have fought . " frank mclynn suggests that napoleon was so successful at austerlitz that he lost touch with reality , and what used to be french foreign policy became a " personal napoleonic one . " vincent cronin disagrees , stating that napoleon was not overly ambitious for himself , " he embodied the ambitions of thirty million frenchmen . "
opponents argue that actual energy savings are inconclusive , that dst increases health risks such as heart attack , that dst can disrupt morning activities , and that the act of changing clocks twice a year is economically and socially disruptive and cancels out any benefit . farmers have tended to oppose dst .
at the end of the war , the victorious powers sought to divide up the ottoman empire . signed between the allied and associated powers and ottoman empire at sevres on 10 august 1920 , the treaty of sevres promised to maintain the existence of the armenian republic and to attach the former territories of ottoman armenia to it . because the new borders of armenia were to be drawn by united states president woodrow wilson , ottoman armenia was also referred to as " wilsonian armenia . " in addition , just days prior , on 5 august 1920 , mihran damadian of the armenian national union , the de facto armenian administration in cilicia , declared the independence of cilicia as an armenian autonomous republic under french protectorate .
in 1936 , wever was killed in an air crash . the failure to implement his vision for the new luftwaffe was largely attributable to his immediate successors . ex-army personnel albert kesselring and hans-jurgen stumpff are usually blamed for the turning away from strategic planning and focusing on close air support . however , it would seem the two most prominent enthusiasts for the focus on ground-support operations ( direct or indirect ) were actually hugo sperrle and hans jeschonnek . these men were long-time professional airmen involved in german air services since early in their careers . the luftwaffe was not pressured into ground support operations because of pressure from the army , or because it was led by ex-army personnel . it was instead a mission that suited the luftwaffe 's existing approach to warfare ; a culture of joint inter-service operations , rather than independent strategic air campaigns .
the cold war drew to a close in the late 1980s and the early 1990s . the united states under president ronald reagan increased diplomatic , military , and economic pressure on the soviet union , which was already suffering from severe economic stagnation . in the second half of the 1980s , newly appointed soviet leader mikhail gorbachev introduced the perestroika and glasnost reforms . the soviet union collapsed in 1991 , leaving the united states as the dominant military power , though russia retained much of the massive soviet nuclear arsenal .
in the 19th century , southern and central european sport hunters often pursued game only for a trophy , usually the head or pelt of an animal , which was then displayed as a sign of prowess . the rest of the animal was typically discarded . some cultures , however , disapprove of such waste . in nordic countries , hunting for trophies was - and still is - frowned upon . hunting in north america in the 19th century was done primarily as a way to supplement food supplies , although it is now undertaken mainly for sport . [ citation needed ] the safari method of hunting was a development of sport hunting that saw elaborate travel in africa , india and other places in pursuit of trophies . in modern times , trophy hunting persists and is a significant industry in some areas .

ronald inden writes that by the 8th century ce symbols of hindu gods " replaced the buddha at the imperial centre and pinnacle of the cosmo-political system , the image or symbol of the hindu god comes to be housed in a monumental temple and given increasingly elaborate imperial-style puja worship . " although buddhism did not disappear from india for several centuries after the eighth , royal proclivities for the cults of vishnu and shiva weakened buddhism 's position within the sociopolitical context and helped make possible its decline .
although some indigenous peoples of the americas were traditionally hunter-gatherers - and many , especially in amazonia , still are - many groups practiced aquaculture and agriculture . the impact of their agricultural endowment to the world is a testament to their time and work in reshaping and cultivating the flora indigenous to the americas . although some societies depended heavily on agriculture , others practiced a mix of farming , hunting , and gathering . in some regions the indigenous peoples created monumental architecture , large-scale organized cities , chiefdoms , states , and empires .
though queen , as an unmarried young woman victoria was required by social convention to live with her mother , despite their differences over the kensington system and her mother 's continued reliance on conroy . her mother was consigned to a remote apartment in buckingham palace , and victoria often refused to see her . when victoria complained to melbourne that her mother 's close proximity promised " torment for many years , " melbourne sympathised but said it could be avoided by marriage , which victoria called a " schocking [ sic ] alternative . " she showed interest in albert 's education for the future role he would have to play as her husband , but she resisted attempts to rush her into wedlock .
a pre-war plan laid out by the late marshal niel called for a strong french offensive from thionville towards trier and into the prussian rhineland . this plan was discarded in favour of a defensive plan by generals charles frossard and bartelemy lebrun , which called for the army of the rhine to remain in a defensive posture near the german border and repel any prussian offensive . as austria along with bavaria , wurttemberg and baden were expected to join in a revenge war against prussia , i corps would invade the bavarian palatinate and proceed to " free " the south german states in concert with austro-hungarian forces . vi corps would reinforce either army as needed .
birds have featured in culture and art since prehistoric times , when they were represented in early cave paintings . some birds have been perceived as monsters , including the mythological roc and the maori 's legendary pouakai , a giant bird capable of snatching humans . birds were later used as symbols of power , as in the magnificent peacock throne of the mughal and persian emperors . with the advent of scientific interest in birds , many paintings of birds were commissioned for books . among the most famous of these bird artists was john james audubon , whose paintings of north american birds were a great commercial success in europe and who later lent his name to the national audubon society . birds are also important figures in poetry ; for example , homer incorporated nightingales into his odyssey , and catullus used a sparrow as an erotic symbol in his catullus 2 . the relationship between an albatross and a sailor is the central theme of samuel taylor coleridge 's the rime of the ancient mariner , which led to the use of the term as a metaphor for a ' burden ' . other english metaphors derive from birds ; vulture funds and vulture investors , for instance , take their name from the scavenging vulture .
but hanover is not only one of the most important exhibition cities in the world , it is also one of the german capitals for marksmen . the schutzenfest hannover is the largest marksmen 's fun fair in the world and takes place once a year ( late june to early july ) ( 2014 - july 4th to the 13th ) . it consists of more than 260 rides and inns , five large beer tents and a big entertainment programme . the highlight of this fun fair is the 12 kilometres ( 7 mi ) long parade of the marksmen with more than 12.000 participants from all over the world , among them around 5.000 marksmen , 128 bands and more than 70 wagons , carriages and big festival vehicles . it is the longest procession in europe . around 2 million people visit this fun fair every year . the landmark of this fun fair is the biggest transportable ferris wheel in the world ( 60 m or 197 ft high ) . the origins of this fun fair is located in the year 1529 .
the body 's capability to react to antigen depends on a person 's age , antigen type , maternal factors and the area where the antigen is presented . neonates are said to be in a state of physiological immunodeficiency , because both their innate and adaptive immunological responses are greatly suppressed . once born , a child 's immune system responds favorably to protein antigens while not as well to glycoproteins and polysaccharides . in fact , many of the infections acquired by neonates are caused by low virulence organisms like staphylococcus and pseudomonas . in neonates , opsonic activity and the ability to activate the complement cascade is very limited . for example , the mean level of c3 in a newborn is approximately 65 % of that found in the adult . phagocytic activity is also greatly impaired in newborns . this is due to lower opsonic activity , as well as diminished up-regulation of integrin and selectin receptors , which limit the ability of neutrophils to interact with adhesion molecules in the endothelium . their monocytes are slow and have a reduced atp production , which also limits the newborn 's phagocytic activity . although , the number of total lymphocytes is significantly higher than in adults , the cellular and humoral immunity is also impaired . antigen-presenting cells in newborns have a reduced capability to activate t cells . also , t cells of a newborn proliferate poorly and produce very small amounts of cytokines like il-2 , il-4 , il-5 , il-12 , and ifn-g which limits their capacity to activate the humoral response as well as the phagocitic activity of macrophage . b cells develop early during gestation but are not fully active .
cross-cultural study of comics is complicated by the great difference in meaning and scope of the words for " comics " in different languages . the french term for comics , bandes dessinees ( " drawn strip " ) emphasizes the juxtaposition of drawn images as a defining factor , which can imply the exclusion of even photographic comics . the term manga is used in japanese to indicate all forms of comics , cartooning , and caricature .
terrestrial annelids can be invasive in some situations . in the glaciated areas of north america , for example , almost all native earthworms are thought to have been killed by the glaciers and the worms currently found in those areas are all introduced from other areas , primarily from europe , and , more recently , from asia . northern hardwood forests are especially negatively impacted by invasive worms through the loss of leaf duff , soil fertility , changes in soil chemistry and the loss of ecological diversity . especially of concern is amynthas agrestis and at least one state ( wisconsin ) has listed it as a prohibited species .
additionally , henna is an important part of somali culture . it is worn by somali women on their hands , arms , feet and neck during weddings , eid , ramadan , and other festive occasions . somali henna designs are similar to those in the arabian peninsula , often featuring flower motifs and triangular shapes . the palm is also frequently decorated with a dot of henna and the fingertips are dipped in the dye . henna parties are usually held before the wedding takes place . somali women have likewise traditionally applied kohl ( kuul ) to their eyes . usage of the eye cosmetic in the horn region is believed to date to the ancient land of punt .
groove recordings , first designed in the final quarter of the 19th century , held a predominant position for nearly a century - withstanding competition from reel-to-reel tape , the 8-track cartridge , and the compact cassette . in 1988 , the compact disc surpassed the gramophone record in unit sales . vinyl records experienced a sudden decline in popularity between 1988 and 1991 , when the major label distributors restricted their return policies , which retailers had been relying on to maintain and swap out stocks of relatively unpopular titles . first the distributors began charging retailers more for new product if they returned unsold vinyl , and then they stopped providing any credit at all for returns . retailers , fearing they would be stuck with anything they ordered , only ordered proven , popular titles that they knew would sell , and devoted more shelf space to cds and cassettes . record companies also deleted many vinyl titles from production and distribution , further undermining the availability of the format and leading to the closure of pressing plants . this rapid decline in the availability of records accelerated the format 's decline in popularity , and is seen by some as a deliberate ploy to make consumers switch to cds , which were more profitable for the record companies .
in the late 12th-century , a school of polyphony was established at the notre-dame . a group of parisian aristocrats , known as trouveres , became known for their poetry and songs . troubadors were also popular . during the reign of francois i , the lute became popular in the french court , and a national musical printing house was established . during the renaissance era , the french boleroroyals " disported themselves in masques , ballets , allegorical dances , recitals , and opera and comedy . " baroque-era composers include jean-baptiste lully , jean-philippe rameau , and francois couperin and were popular . the conservatoire de musique de paris was founded in 1795 . by 1870 , paris had become an important centre for symphony , ballet and operatic music . romantic-era composers ( in paris ) include hector berlioz ( la symphonie fantastique ) , charles gounod ( faust ) , camille saint-saens ( samson et delilah ) , leo delibes ( lakme ) and jules massenet ( thais ) , among others . georges bizet 's carmen premiered 3 march 1875 . carmen has since become one of the most popular and frequently-performed operas in the classical canon ; impressionist composers claude debussy ( ( la mer ) and maurice ravel ( bolero ) also made significant contributions to piano ( clair de lune , miroirs ) , orchestra , opera ( palleas et melisande ) , and other musical forms . foreign-born composers have made their homes in paris and have made significant contributions both with their works and their influence . they include frederic chopin ( poland ) , franz liszt ( hungary ) , jacques offenbach ( germany ) , and igor stravinsky ( russia ) .
the design and function of department stores in germany followed the lead of london , paris and new york . germany used to have a number of department stores ; nowadays only a few of them remain . next to some smaller , independent department stores these are karstadt ( in 2010 taken over by nicolas berggruen , also operating the kadewe in berlin , the alsterhaus in hamburg and the oberpollinger in munich ) , galeria kaufhof ( part of the metro ag ) . others like hertie , wertheim and horten ag were taken over by others and either fully integrated or later closed .

the quran consists of 114 chapters of varying lengths , each known as a sura . suras are classified as meccan or medinan , depending on whether the verses were revealed before or after the migration of muhammad to the city of medina . however , a sura classified as medinan may contain meccan verses in it and vice versa . sura titles are derived from a name or quality discussed in the text , or from the first letters or words of the sura . suras are arranged roughly in order of decreasing size . the sura arrangement is thus not connected to the sequence of revelation . each sura except the ninth starts with the bismillah ( بسم الله الرحمن الرحيم ) , an arabic phrase meaning " in the name of god . " there are , however , still 114 occurrences of the bismillah in the quran , due to its presence in quran 27 : 30 as the opening of solomon 's letter to the queen of sheba .
due to its position between two unfriendly neighbours , armenia has close security ties with russia . at the request of the armenian government , russia maintains a military base in the northwestern armenian city of gyumri as a deterrent against turkey .

because rebroadcast transmitters were not planned to be converted to digital , many markets stood to lose over-the-air coverage from cbc or radio-canada , or both . as a result , only seven of the markets subject to the august 31 , 2011 transition deadline were planned to have both cbc and radio-canada in digital , and 13 other markets were planned to have either cbc or radio-canada in digital . in mid-august 2011 , the crtc granted the cbc an extension , until august 31 , 2012 , to continue operating its analogue transmitters in markets subject to the august 31 , 2011 transition deadline . this crtc decision prevented many markets subject to the transition deadline from losing signals for cbc or radio-canada , or both at the transition deadline . at the transition deadline , barrie , ontario lost both cbc and radio-canada signals as the cbc did not request that the crtc allow these transmitters to continue operating .
jefferson 's metaphor of a wall of separation has been cited repeatedly by the u.s. supreme court . in reynolds v. united states ( 1879 ) the court wrote that jefferson 's comments " may be accepted almost as an authoritative declaration of the scope and effect of the [ first ] amendment . " in everson v. board of education ( 1947 ) , justice hugo black wrote : " in the words of thomas jefferson , the clause against establishment of religion by law was intended to erect a wall of separation between church and state .

bell 's own detailed account , presented to the american association for the advancement of science in 1882 , differs in several particulars from most of the many and varied versions now in circulation , most notably by concluding that extraneous metal was not to blame for failure to locate the bullet . perplexed by the peculiar results he had obtained during an examination of garfield , bell ... " proceeded to the executive mansion the next morning ... to ascertain from the surgeons whether they were perfectly sure that all metal had been removed from the neighborhood of the bed . it was then recollected that underneath the horse-hair mattress on which the president lay was another mattress composed of steel wires . upon obtaining a duplicate , the mattress was found to consist of a sort of net of woven steel wires , with large meshes . the extent of the [ area that produced a response from the detector ] having been so small , as compared with the area of the bed , it seemed reasonable to conclude that the steel mattress had produced no detrimental effect . " in a footnote , bell adds that " the death of president garfield and the subsequent post-mortem examination , however , proved that the bullet was at too great a distance from the surface to have affected our apparatus . "
there are several reasons an otherwise valid and agreed upon treaty may be rejected as a binding international agreement , most of which involve problems created at the formation of the treaty . [ citation needed ] for example , the serial japan-korea treaties of 1905 , 1907 and 1910 were protested ; and they were confirmed as " already null and void " in the 1965 treaty on basic relations between japan and the republic of korea .
these immigrants were largely responsible for the first general strike in north america in 1835 , in which workers in the city won the ten-hour workday . the city was a destination for thousands of irish immigrants fleeing the great famine in the 1840s ; housing for them was developed south of south street , and was later occupied by succeeding immigrants . they established a network of catholic churches and schools , and dominated the catholic clergy for decades . anti-irish , anti-catholic nativist riots had erupted in philadelphia in 1844 . in the latter half of the century , immigrants from russia , eastern europe and italy ; and african americans from the southern u.s. settled in the city . between 1880 and 1930 , the african-american population of philadelphia increased from 31,699 to 219,559 . twentieth-century black newcomers were part of the great migration out of the rural south to northern and midwestern industrial cities .
town quay is the original public quay , and dates from the 13th century . today 's eastern docks were created in the 1830s by land reclamation of the mud flats between the itchen & test estuaries . the western docks date from the 1930s when the southern railway company commissioned a major land reclamation and dredging programme . most of the material used for reclamation came from dredging of southampton water , to ensure that the port can continue to handle large ships .
whitehead did not begin his career as a philosopher . in fact , he never had any formal training in philosophy beyond his undergraduate education . early in his life he showed great interest in and respect for philosophy and metaphysics , but it is evident that he considered himself a rank amateur . in one letter to his friend and former student bertrand russell , after discussing whether science aimed to be explanatory or merely descriptive , he wrote : " this further question lands us in the ocean of metaphysic , onto which my profound ignorance of that science forbids me to enter . " ironically , in later life whitehead would become one of the 20th century 's foremost metaphysicians .
the first step toward indian self-rule was the appointment of councillors to advise the british viceroy in 1861 and the first indian was appointed in 1909 . provincial councils with indian members were also set up . the councillors ' participation was subsequently widened into legislative councils . the british built a large british indian army , with the senior officers all british and many of the troops from small minority groups such as gurkhas from nepal and sikhs . the civil service was increasingly filled with natives at the lower levels , with the british holding the more senior positions .

the mosaics of the villa romana del casale near piazza armerina in sicily are the largest collection of late roman mosaics in situ in the world , and are protected as a unesco world heritage site . the large villa rustica , which was probably owned by emperor maximian , was built largely in the early 4th century . the mosaics were covered and protected for 700 years by a landslide that occurred in the 12th century . the most important pieces are the circus scene , the 64m long great hunting scene , the little hunt , the labours of hercules and the famous bikini girls , showing women undertaking a range of sporting activities in garments that resemble 20th century bikinis . the peristyle , the imperial apartments and the thermae were also decorated with ornamental and mythological mosaics . other important examples of roman mosaic art in sicily were unearthed on the piazza vittoria in palermo where two houses were discovered . the most important scenes there depicted orpheus , alexander the great 's hunt and the four seasons .
it 's generally accepted that there are around 750 verses in the quran dealing with natural phenomenon . in many of these verses the study of nature is " encouraged and highly recommended , " and historical islamic scientists like al-biruni and al-battani derived their inspiration from verses of the quran . mohammad hashim kamali has the stated that " scientific observation , experimental knowledge and rationality " are the primary tools with which humanity can achieve the goals laid out for it in the quran . ziauddin sardar built a case for muslims having developed the foundations of modern science , by highlighting the repeated calls of the quran to observe and reflect upon natural phenomenon . " the ' scientific method , ' as it is understood today , was first developed by muslim scientists " like ibn al-haytham and al-biruni , along with numerous other muslim scientists .

eleven days after orsini 's assassination attempt in france , victoria 's eldest daughter married prince frederick william of prussia in london . they had been betrothed since september 1855 , when princess victoria was 14 years old ; the marriage was delayed by the queen and prince albert until the bride was 17 . the queen and albert hoped that their daughter and son-in-law would be a liberalising influence in the enlarging prussian state . victoria felt " sick at heart " to see her daughter leave england for germany ; " it really makes me shudder , " she wrote to princess victoria in one of her frequent letters , " when i look round to all your sweet , happy , unconscious sisters , and think i must give them up too - one by one . " almost exactly a year later , princess victoria gave birth to the queen 's first grandchild , wilhelm , who would become the last german kaiser .

stout and porter are dark beers made using roasted malts or roast barley , and typically brewed with slow fermenting yeast . there are a number of variations including baltic porter , dry stout , and imperial stout . the name porter was first used in 1721 to describe a dark brown beer popular with the street and river porters of london . this same beer later also became known as stout , though the word stout had been used as early as 1677 . the history and development of stout and porter are intertwined .
in the 6th century bce , taoist teacher lao tzu espoused a series of naturalistic concepts with some elements of humanistic philosophy . the silver rule of confucianism from analects xv.24 , is an example of ethical philosophy based on human values rather than the supernatural . humanistic thought is also contained in other confucian classics , e.g. , as recorded in zuo zhuan , ji liang says , " people is the zhu ( master , lord , dominance , owner or origin ) of gods . so , to sage kings , people first , gods second " ; neishi guo says , " gods , clever , righteous and wholehearted , comply with human . " taoist and confucian secularism contain elements of moral thought devoid of religious authority or deism however they only partly resembled our modern concept of secularism .
until the 20th century , there was no clear record of the number of venezuelans who emigrated to the united states . between the 18th and early 19th centuries , there were many european immigrants who went to venezuela , only to later migrate to the united states along with their children and grandchildren who born and / or grew up in venezuela speaking spanish . from 1910 to 1930 , it is estimated that over 4,000 south americans each year emigrated to the united states ; however , there are few specific figures indicating these statistics . many venezuelans settled in the united states with hopes of receiving a better education , only to remain in there following graduation . they are frequently joined by relatives . however , since the early 1980s , the reasons for venezuelan emigration have changed to include hopes of earning a higher salary and due to the economic fluctuations in venezuela which also promoted an important migration of venezuelan professionals to the us .
from september 1823 to 1826 chopin attended the warsaw lyceum , where he received organ lessons from the czech musician wilhelm wurfel during his first year . in the autumn of 1826 he began a three-year course under the silesian composer jozef elsner at the warsaw conservatory , studying music theory , figured bass and composition . [ n 3 ] throughout this period he continued to compose and to give recitals in concerts and salons in warsaw . he was engaged by the inventors of a mechanical organ , the " eolomelodicon , " and on this instrument in may 1825 he performed his own improvisation and part of a concerto by moscheles . the success of this concert led to an invitation to give a similar recital on the instrument before tsar alexander i , who was visiting warsaw ; the tsar presented him with a diamond ring . at a subsequent eolomelodicon concert on 10 june 1825 , chopin performed his rondo op. 1 . this was the first of his works to be commercially published and earned him his first mention in the foreign press , when the leipzig allgemeine musikalische zeitung praised his " wealth of musical ideas . "
in july 1953 , an armistice took effect with korea divided along approximately the same boundary as in 1950 . the armistice and boundary remain in effect today , with american soldiers stationed there to guarantee it . the armistice , concluded despite opposition from secretary dulles , south korean president syngman rhee , and also within eisenhower 's party , has been described by biographer ambrose as the greatest achievement of the administration . eisenhower had the insight to realize that unlimited war in the nuclear age was unthinkable , and limited war unwinnable .
in 2007 , the official xinhua news agency reported that the resolution of the beidou system was as high as 0.5 metres . with the existing user terminals it appears that the calibrated accuracy is 20m ( 100m , uncalibrated ) .
each island has its own high-chief , or ulu-aliki , and several sub-chiefs ( alikis ) . the community council is the falekaupule ( the traditional assembly of elders ) or te sina o fenua ( literally : " grey-hairs of the land " ) . in the past , another caste , the priests ( tofuga ) , were also amongst the decision-makers . the ulu-aliki and aliki exercise informal authority at the local level . ulu-aliki are always chosen based on ancestry . under the falekaupule act ( 1997 ) , the powers and functions of the falekaupule are now shared with the pule o kaupule ( elected village presidents ; one on each atoll ) .
the hole walls for boards with two or more layers can be made conductive and then electroplated with copper to form plated-through holes . these holes electrically connect the conducting layers of the pcb . for multi-layer boards , those with three layers or more , drilling typically produces a smear of the high temperature decomposition products of bonding agent in the laminate system . before the holes can be plated through , this smear must be removed by a chemical de-smear process , or by plasma-etch . the de-smear process ensures that a good connection is made to the copper layers when the hole is plated through . on high reliability boards a process called etch-back is performed chemically with a potassium permanganate based etchant or plasma . the etch-back removes resin and the glass fibers so that the copper layers extend into the hole and as the hole is plated become integral with the deposited copper .
greece has the largest merchant navy in the world , accounting for more than 15 % of the world 's total deadweight tonnage ( dwt ) according to the united nations conference on trade and development . the greek merchant navy 's total dwt of nearly 245 million is comparable only to japan 's , which is ranked second with almost 224 million . additionally , greece represents 39.52 % of all of the european union 's dwt . however , today 's fleet roster is smaller than an all-time high of 5,000 ships in the late 1970s .
integral to the story of the origin of the name " antarctica " is how it was not named terra australis - this name was given to australia instead , and it was because of a mistake made by people who decided that a significant landmass would not be found farther south than australia . explorer matthew flinders , in particular , has been credited with popularizing the transfer of the name terra australis to australia . he justified the titling of his book a voyage to terra australis ( 1814 ) by writing in the introduction :
the city 's largest private school by number of students is temple university , followed by drexel university . along with the university of pennsylvania , temple university and drexel university make up the city 's major research universities . the city is also home to five schools of medicine : drexel university college of medicine , perelman school of medicine at the university of pennsylvania , philadelphia college of osteopathic medicine , temple university school of medicine , and the thomas jefferson university . hospitals , universities , and higher education research institutions in philadelphia 's four congressional districts received more than $ 252 million in national institutes of health grants in 2015 .
students from the imperial university organized a widespread student protest against the eunuchs of emperor huan 's court . huan further alienated the bureaucracy when he initiated grandiose construction projects and hosted thousands of concubines in his harem at a time of economic crisis . palace eunuchs imprisoned the official li ying ( 李膺 ) and his associates from the imperial university on a dubious charge of treason . in 167 ad , the grand commandant dou wu ( d . 168 ad ) convinced his son-in-law , emperor huan , to release them . however the emperor permanently barred li ying and his associates from serving in office , marking the beginning of the partisan prohibitions .
there are a number of aids available to pilots , though not all airports are equipped with them . a visual approach slope indicator ( vasi ) helps pilots fly the approach for landing . some airports are equipped with a vhf omnidirectional range ( vor ) to help pilots find the direction to the airport . vors are often accompanied by a distance measuring equipment ( dme ) to determine the distance to the vor . vors are also located off airports , where they serve to provide airways for aircraft to navigate upon . in poor weather , pilots will use an instrument landing system ( ils ) to find the runway and fly the correct approach , even if they cannot see the ground . the number of instrument approaches based on the use of the global positioning system ( gps ) is rapidly increasing and may eventually be the primary means for instrument landings .
some countries are eliminating or reducing climate disrupting subsidies and belgium , france , and japan have phased out all subsidies for coal . germany is reducing its coal subsidy . the subsidy dropped from $ 5.4 billion in 1989 to $ 2.8 billion in 2002 , and in the process germany lowered its coal use by 46 percent . china cut its coal subsidy from $ 750 million in 1993 to $ 240 million in 1995 and more recently has imposed a high-sulfur coal tax . however , the united states has been increasing its support for the fossil fuel and nuclear industries .
as in many other countries , child labour in switzerland affected among the so-called kaminfegerkinder ( " chimney sweep children " ) and chidren working p.e. in spinning mills , factories and in agriculture in 19th-century switzerland , but also to the 1960s so-called verdingkinder ( literally : " contract children " or " indentured child laborers " ) were children who were taken from their parents , often due to poverty or moral reasons - usually mothers being unmarried , very poor citizens , of gypsy-yeniche origin , so-called kinder der landstrasse , etc . - and sent to live with new families , often poor farmers who needed cheap labour .
the current mac product family uses intel x86-64 processors . apple introduced an emulator during the transition from powerpc chips ( called rosetta ) , much as it did during the transition from motorola 68000 architecture a decade earlier . the macintosh is the only mainstream computer platform to have successfully transitioned to a new cpu architecture , and has done so twice . all current mac models ship with at least 8 gb of ram as standard other than the 1.4 ghz mac mini , macbook pro ( without retina display ) , and macbook air . current mac computers use ati radeon or nvidia geforce graphics cards as well as intel graphics built into the main cpu . all current macs ( except for the macbook pro without retina display ) do not ship with an optical media drive that includes a dual-function dvd / cd burner . apple refers to this as a superdrive . current macs include two standard data transfer ports : usb and thunderbolt ( except for the macbook ( 2015 version ) , which only has a usb-c port and headphone port ) . macbook pro , imac , macbook air , and mac mini computers now also feature the " thunderbolt " port , which apple says can transfer data at speeds up to 10 gigabits per second . usb was introduced in the 1998 imac g3 and is ubiquitous today , while firewire is mainly reserved for high-performance devices such as hard drives or video cameras . starting with the then-new imac g5 , released in october 2005 , apple started to include built-in isight cameras on appropriate models , and a media center interface called front row that can be operated by an apple remote or keyboard for accessing media stored on the computer . front row has been discontinued as of 2011 , however , and the apple remote is no longer bundled with new macs .

the enlightenment has been frequently linked to the french revolution of 1789 . one view of the political changes that occurred during the enlightenment is that the " consent of the governed " philosophy as delineated by locke in two treatises of government ( 1689 ) represented a paradigm shift from the old governance paradigm under feudalism known as the " divine right of kings . " in this view , the revolutions of the late 1700s and early 1800s were caused by the fact that this governance paradigm shift often could not be resolved peacefully , and therefore violent revolution was the result . clearly a governance philosophy where the king was never wrong was in direct conflict with one whereby citizens by natural law had to consent to the acts and rulings of their government .
in 1937 , the empire of japan started a full-scale invasion of china after invading manchuria in 1931 , beginning the second sino-japanese war ( often considered a theatre of world war ii ) . their troops occupied nanjing in december and carried out the systematic and brutal nanking massacre ( the " rape of nanking " ) . even children , the elderly , and nuns are reported to have suffered at the hands of the imperial japanese army . the total death toll , including estimates made by the international military tribunal for the far east and the nanjing war crimes tribunal , was between 300,000 and 350,000 . the city itself was also severely damaged during the massacre . the nanjing massacre memorial hall was built in 1985 to commemorate this event .
the mdna tour , which further promoted the album , began in may 2012 in tel aviv , israel . the tour has received positive critical reception , but featured controversial subjects such as violence , firearms , human rights , nudity and politics . lawsuits threatened against madonna have also been engaged from the tour . it was a box office success with a gross of $ 305.2 million from 88 sold-out shows , and became the highest-grossing tour of 2012 and the tenth highest-grossing tour of all time . at the 2013 billboard music awards , madonna won three trophies for top touring artist , top dance artist and top dance album . madonna was named the top-earning celebrity of the year by forbes , earning an estimated $ 125 million , due to the success of the tour .
whereas scims cannot turn a shaft faster than allowed by the power line frequency , universal motors can run at much higher speeds . this makes them useful for appliances such as blenders , vacuum cleaners , and hair dryers where high speed and light weight are desirable . they are also commonly used in portable power tools , such as drills , sanders , circular and jig saws , where the motor 's characteristics work well . many vacuum cleaner and weed trimmer motors exceed 10,000 rpm , while many similar miniature grinders exceed 30,000 rpm .
schwarzenegger has admitted to using performance-enhancing anabolic steroids while they were legal , writing in 1977 that " steroids were helpful to me in maintaining muscle size while on a strict diet in preparation for a contest . i did not use them for muscle growth , but rather for muscle maintenance when cutting up . " he has called the drugs " tissue building . "
athanasius 's episcopate began on 9 may 328 as the alexandrian council elected athanasius to succeed the aged alexander . that council also denounced various heresies and schisms , many of which continued to preoccupy his 45-year-long episcopate ( c . 8 june 328 - 2 may 373 ) . patriarch athanasius spent over 17 years in five exiles ordered by four different roman emperors , not counting approximately six more incidents in which athanasius fled alexandria to escape people seeking to take his life . this gave rise to the expression " athanasius contra mundum " or " athanasius against the world . " however , during his first years as bishop , athanasius visited the churches of his territory , which at that time included all of egypt and libya . he established contacts with the hermits and monks of the desert , including pachomius , which proved very valuable to him over the years . shortly thereafter , athanasius became occupied with the theological disputes against arians within the byzantine empire that would occupy much of his life .
the problem of the flow of time , as it has been treated in analytic philosophy , owes its beginning to a paper written by j. m. e. mctaggart . in this paper mctaggart proposes two " temporal series . " the first series , which means to account for our intuitions about temporal becoming , or the moving now , is called the a-series . the a-series orders events according to their being in the past , present or future , simpliciter and in comparison to each other . the b-series eliminates all reference to the present , and the associated temporal modalities of past and future , and orders all events by the temporal relations earlier than and later than .
due to extreme variation in elevation , great variation occurs in the climatic conditions of himachal . the climate varies from hot and subhumid tropical in the southern tracts to , with more elevation , cold , alpine , and glacial in the northern and eastern mountain ranges . the state has areas like dharamsala that receive very heavy rainfall , as well as those like lahaul and spiti that are cold and almost rainless . broadly , himachal experiences three seasons : summer , winter , and rainy season . summer lasts from mid-april till the end of june and most parts become very hot ( except in the alpine zone which experiences a mild summer ) with the average temperature ranging from 28 to 32 ° c ( 82 to 90 ° f ) . winter lasts from late november till mid march . snowfall is common in alpine tracts ( generally above 2,200 metres ( 7,218 ft ) i.e. in the higher and trans-himalayan region ) .
kenneth gergen formulated additional classifications , which include the strategic manipulator , the pastiche personality , and the relational self . the strategic manipulator is a person who begins to regard all senses of identity merely as role-playing exercises , and who gradually becomes alienated from his or her social " self . " the pastiche personality abandons all aspirations toward a true or " essential " identity , instead viewing social interactions as opportunities to play out , and hence become , the roles they play . finally , the relational self is a perspective by which persons abandon all sense of exclusive self , and view all sense of identity in terms of social engagement with others . for gergen , these strategies follow one another in phases , and they are linked to the increase in popularity of postmodern culture and the rise of telecommunications technology .
the channel also broadcasts two movie blocks during the late evening hours each sunday : " silent sunday nights , " which features silent films from the united states and abroad , usually in the latest restored version and often with new musical scores ; and " tcm imports " ( which previously ran on saturdays until the early 2000s [ specify ] ) , a weekly presentation of films originally released in foreign countries . tcm underground - which debuted in october 2006 - is a friday late night block which focuses on cult films , the block was originally hosted by rocker / filmmaker rob zombie until december 2006 ( though as of 2014 [ update ] , it is the only regular film presentation block on the channel that does not have a host ) .
liberia has a long , rich history in textile arts and quilting , as the settlers brought with them their sewing and quilting skills . liberia hosted national fairs in 1857 and 1858 in which prizes were awarded for various needle arts . one of the most well-known liberian quilters was martha ann ricks , who presented a quilt featuring the famed liberian coffee tree to queen victoria in 1892 . when president ellen johnson sirleaf moved into the executive mansion , she reportedly had a liberian-made quilt installed in her presidential office .
in 1880 , bell received the volta prize with a purse of 50,000 francs ( approximately us $ 250,000 in today 's dollars ) for the invention of the telephone from the academie francaise , representing the french government . among the luminaries who judged were victor hugo and alexandre dumas . the volta prize was conceived by napoleon bonaparte in 1801 , and named in honor of alessandro volta , with bell receiving the third grand prize in its history . since bell was becoming increasingly affluent , he used his prize money to create endowment funds ( the ' volta fund ' ) and institutions in and around the united states capital of washington , d.c .. these included the prestigious ' volta laboratory association ' ( 1880 ) , also known as the volta laboratory and as the ' alexander graham bell laboratory ' , and which eventually led to the volta bureau ( 1887 ) as a center for studies on deafness which is still in operation in georgetown , washington , d.c. the volta laboratory became an experimental facility devoted to scientific discovery , and the very next year it improved edison 's phonograph by substituting wax for tinfoil as the recording medium and incising the recording rather than indenting it , key upgrades that edison himself later adopted . the laboratory was also the site where he and his associate invented his " proudest achievement , " " the photophone , " the " optical telephone " which presaged fibre optical telecommunications , while the volta bureau would later evolve into the alexander graham bell association for the deaf and hard of hearing ( the ag bell ) , a leading center for the research and pedagogy of deafness .
the initial military maneuvers began in september 1806 . in a notable letter to marshal soult detailing the plan for the campaign , napoleon described the essential features of napoleonic warfare and introduced the phrase le bataillon-carre ( ' square battalion ' ) . in the bataillon-carre system , the various corps of the grande armee would march uniformly together in close supporting distance . if any single corps was attacked , the others could quickly spring into action and arrive to help . napoleon invaded prussia with 180,000 troops , rapidly marching on the right bank of the river saale . as in previous campaigns , his fundamental objective was to destroy one opponent before reinforcements from another could tip the balance of the war . upon learning the whereabouts of the prussian army , the french swung westwards and crossed the saale with overwhelming force . at the twin battles of jena and auerstedt , fought on 14 october , the french convincingly defeated the prussians and inflicted heavy casualties . with several major commanders dead or incapacitated , the prussian king proved incapable of effectively commanding the army , which began to quickly disintegrate . in a vaunted pursuit that epitomized the " peak of napoleonic warfare , " according to historian richard brooks , the french managed to capture 140,000 soldiers , over 2,000 cannons and hundreds of ammunition wagons , all in a single month . historian david chandler wrote of the prussian forces : " never has the morale of any army been more completely shattered . " despite their overwhelming defeat , the prussians refused to negotiate with the french until the russians had an opportunity to enter the fight .
after the romans left , britain was invaded by anglo-saxon peoples . by ad 600 they had established control over much of what is now england , but somerset was still in native british hands . the british held back saxon advance into the south-west for some time longer , but by the early eighth century king ine of wessex had pushed the boundaries of the west saxon kingdom far enough west to include somerset . the saxon royal palace in cheddar was used several times in the 10th century to host the witenagemot . after the norman conquest , the county was divided into 700 fiefs , and large areas were owned by the crown , with fortifications such as dunster castle used for control and defence . somerset contains hm prison shepton mallet , which was england 's oldest prison still in use prior to its closure in 2013 , having opened in 1610 . in the english civil war somerset was largely parliamentarian , with key engagements being the sieges of taunton and the battle of langport . in 1685 the monmouth rebellion was played out in somerset and neighbouring dorset . the rebels landed at lyme regis and travelled north , hoping to capture bristol and bath , but they were defeated in the battle of sedgemoor at westonzoyland , the last pitched battle fought in england . arthur wellesley took his title , duke of wellington from the town of wellington ; he is commemorated on a nearby hill by a large , spotlit obelisk , known as the wellington monument .
state schools in somerset are provided by three local education authorities : bath and north east somerset , north somerset , and the larger somerset county council . all state schools are comprehensive . in some areas primary , infant and junior schools cater for ages four to eleven , after which the pupils move on to secondary schools . there is a three-tier system of first , middle and upper schools in the cheddar valley , and in west somerset , while most other schools in the county use the two-tier system . somerset has 30 state and 17 independent secondary schools ; bath and north east somerset has 13 state and 5 independent secondary schools ; and north somerset has 10 state and 2 independent secondary schools , excluding sixth form colleges .

while the french army under general macmahon engaged the german 3rd army at the battle of worth , the german 1st army under steinmetz finished their advance west from saarbrucken . a patrol from the german 2nd army under prince friedrich karl of prussia spotted decoy fires close and frossard 's army farther off on a distant plateau south of the town of spicheren , and took this as a sign of frossard 's retreat . ignoring moltke 's plan again , both german armies attacked frossard 's french 2nd corps , fortified between spicheren and forbach .
the largest mammal to live in the highest altitudes are the alpine ibex , which have been sighted as high as 3,000 m ( 9,843 ft ) . the ibex live in caves and descend to eat the succulent alpine grasses . classified as antelopes , chamois are smaller than ibex and found throughout the alps , living above the tree line and are common in the entire alpine range . areas of the eastern alps are still home to brown bears . in switzerland the canton of bern was named for the bears but the last bear is recorded as having been killed in 1792 above kleine scheidegg by three hunters from grindelwald .
the climate in the state depends mainly in the elevation of the terrain . according to koppen climate classification the state has five major climate zones . the sierra madre occidental dominates the western part of the state ; there are two main climates in this area : subtropical highland ( cfb ) and humid subtropical ( cwa ) . there are some microclimates in the state due to the varying topology mostly found in the western side of the state . the two best known microclimates are : tropical savanna climate ( aw ) in deep canyons located in the extreme southern part of the state ; continental mediterranean climate ( dsb ) in the extremely high elevations of the sierra madre occidental . satellite image to the right shows the vegetation is much greener in the west because of the cooler temperatures and larger amounts of precipitation as compared to the rest of the state .
the gdp of thuringia is below the national average , in line with the other former east german lands . until 2004 , thuringia was one of the weakest regions within the european union . the accession of several new countries , the crisis in southern europe and the sustained economic growth in germany since 2005 has brought the thuringian gdp close to the eu average since then . the high economic subsidies granted by the federal government and the eu after 1990 are being reduced gradually and will end around 2020 .
jehovah 's witnesses believe their highest allegiance belongs to god 's kingdom , which is viewed as an actual government in heaven , with christ as king . they remain politically neutral , do not seek public office , and are discouraged from voting , though individual members may participate in uncontroversial community improvement issues . although they do not take part in politics , they respect the authority of the governments under which they live . they do not celebrate religious holidays such as christmas and easter , nor do they observe birthdays , nationalistic holidays , or other celebrations they consider to honor people other than jesus . they feel that these and many other customs have pagan origins or reflect a nationalistic or political spirit . their position is that these traditional holidays reflect satan 's control over the world . witnesses are told that spontaneous giving at other times can help their children to not feel deprived of birthdays or other celebrations .
jerusalem with its many holy places probably had the highest concentration of mosaic-covered churches but very few of them survived the subsequent waves of destructions . the present remains do not do justice to the original richness of the city . the most important is the so-called " armenian mosaic " which was discovered in 1894 on the street of the prophets near damascus gate . it depicts a vine with many branches and grape clusters , which springs from a vase . populating the vine 's branches are peacocks , ducks , storks , pigeons , an eagle , a partridge , and a parrot in a cage . the inscription reads : " for the memory and salvation of all those armenians whose name the lord knows . " beneath a corner of the mosaic is a small , natural cave which contained human bones dating to the 5th or 6th centuries . the symbolism of the mosaic and the presence of the burial cave indicates that the room was used as a mortuary chapel .

the inhabitants of the british isles have been drinking ale since the bronze age , but it was with the arrival of the roman empire in its shores in the 1st century , and the construction of the roman road networks that the first inns , called tabernae , in which travellers could obtain refreshment began to appear . after the departure of roman authority in the 5th century and the fall of the romano-british kingdoms , the anglo-saxons established alehouses that grew out of domestic dwellings , the anglo-saxon alewife would put a green bush up on a pole to let people know her brew was ready . these alehouses quickly evolved into meeting houses for the folk to socially congregate , gossip and arrange mutual help within their communities . herein lies the origin of the modern public house , or " pub " as it is colloquially called in england . they rapidly spread across the kingdom , becoming so commonplace that in 965 king edgar decreed that there should be no more than one alehouse per village .
innate bisexuality is an idea introduced by sigmund freud . according to this theory , all humans are born bisexual in a very broad sense of the term , that of incorporating general aspects of both sexes . in freud 's view , this was true anatomically and therefore also psychologically , with sexual attraction to both sexes being one part of this psychological bisexuality . freud believed that in the course of sexual development the masculine side would normally become dominant in men and the feminine side in women , but that as adults everyone still has desires derived from both the masculine and the feminine sides of their natures . freud did not claim that everyone is bisexual in the sense of feeling the same level of sexual attraction to both genders .
in western catalan , unstressed vowels reduce to five : / e ɛ / > [ e ] ; / o ɔ / > [ o ] ; / a u i / remain distinct . this reduction pattern , inherited from proto-romance , is also found in italian and portuguese . some western dialects present further reduction or vowel harmony in some cases .
thermally , a temperate glacier is at melting point throughout the year , from its surface to its base . the ice of a polar glacier is always below freezing point from the surface to its base , although the surface snowpack may experience seasonal melting . a sub-polar glacier includes both temperate and polar ice , depending on depth beneath the surface and position along the length of the glacier . in a similar way , the thermal regime of a glacier is often described by the temperature at its base alone . a cold-based glacier is below freezing at the ice-ground interface , and is thus frozen to the underlying substrate . a warm-based glacier is above or at freezing at the interface , and is able to slide at this contact . this contrast is thought to a large extent to govern the ability of a glacier to effectively erode its bed , as sliding ice promotes plucking at rock from the surface below . glaciers which are partly cold-based and partly warm-based are known as polythermal .
in june 1986 , madonna released her third studio album , true blue , which was inspired by and dedicated to sean penn . rolling stone magazine was generally impressed with the effort , writing that the album " sound [ s ] as if it comes from the heart .

roman women were present at most festivals and cult observances . some rituals specifically required the presence of women , but their active participation was limited . as a rule women did not perform animal sacrifice , the central rite of most major public ceremonies . in addition to the public priesthood of the vestals , some cult practices were reserved for women only . the rites of the bona dea excluded men entirely . because women enter the public record less frequently than men , their religious practices are less known , and even family cults were headed by the paterfamilias . a host of deities , however , are associated with motherhood . juno , diana , lucina , and specialized divine attendants presided over the life-threatening act of giving birth and the perils of caring for a baby at a time when the infant mortality rate was as high as 40 percent .
the rotating armature consists of one or more coils of wire wound around a laminated , magnetically " soft " ferromagnetic core . current from the brushes flows through the commutator and one winding of the armature , making it a temporary magnet ( an electromagnet ) . the magnetic field produced by the armature interacts with a stationary magnetic field produced by either pms or another winding a field coil , as part of the motor frame . the force between the two magnetic fields tends to rotate the motor shaft . the commutator switches power to the coils as the rotor turns , keeping the magnetic poles of the rotor from ever fully aligning with the magnetic poles of the stator field , so that the rotor never stops ( like a compass needle does ) , but rather keeps rotating as long as power is applied .
in 1762 , towards the end of the war , french forces attacked st. john 's , newfoundland . if successful , the expedition would have strengthened france 's hand at the negotiating table . although they took st. john 's and raided nearby settlements , the french forces were eventually defeated by british troops at the battle of signal hill . this was the final battle of the war in north america , and it forced the french to surrender to lieutenant colonel william amherst . the victorious british now controlled all of eastern north america .
genetic engineering is the modification of an organism 's genome through biotechnology . since the 1970s , a variety of techniques have been developed to specifically add , remove and edit genes in an organism . recently developed genome engineering techniques use engineered nuclease enzymes to create targeted dna repair in a chromosome to either disrupt or edit a gene when the break is repaired . the related term synthetic biology is sometimes used to refer to extensive genetic engineering of an organism .
copper has been used since ancient times as a durable , corrosion resistant , and weatherproof architectural material . roofs , flashings , rain gutters , downspouts , domes , spires , vaults , and doors have been made from copper for hundreds or thousands of years . copper 's architectural use has been expanded in modern times to include interior and exterior wall cladding , building expansion joints , radio frequency shielding , and antimicrobial indoor products , such as attractive handrails , bathroom fixtures , and counter tops . some of copper 's other important benefits as an architectural material include its low thermal movement , light weight , lightning protection , and its recyclability .

the hummers that schwarzenegger bought 1992 are so large - each weighs 6,300 lb ( 2,900 kg ) and is 7 feet ( 2.1 m ) wide - that they are classified as large trucks , and u.s. fuel economy regulations do not apply to them . during the gubernatorial recall campaign he announced that he would convert one of his hummers to burn hydrogen . the conversion was reported to have cost about us $ 21,000 . after the election , he signed an executive order to jump-start the building of hydrogen refueling plants called the california hydrogen highway network , and gained a u.s. department of energy grant to help pay for its projected us $ 91,000,000 cost . california took delivery of the first h2h ( hydrogen hummer ) in october 2004 .
hiberni ( ireland ) , pictish ( northern britain ) and britons ( southern britain ) tribes , all speaking insular celtic , inhabited the islands at the beginning of the 1st millennium ad . much of brittonic-controlled britain was conquered by the roman empire from ad 43 . the first anglo-saxons arrived as roman power waned in the 5th century and eventually dominated the bulk of what is now england . viking invasions began in the 9th century , followed by more permanent settlements and political change - particularly in england . the subsequent norman conquest of england in 1066 and the later angevin partial conquest of ireland from 1169 led to the imposition of a new norman ruling elite across much of britain and parts of ireland . by the late middle ages , great britain was separated into the kingdoms of england and scotland , while control in ireland fluxed between gaelic kingdoms , hiberno-norman lords and the english-dominated lordship of ireland , soon restricted only to the pale . the 1603 union of the crowns , acts of union 1707 and acts of union 1800 attempted to consolidate britain and ireland into a single political unit , the united kingdom of great britain and ireland , with the isle of man and the channel islands remaining as crown dependencies . the expansion of the british empire and migrations following the irish famine and highland clearances resulted in the distribution of the islands ' population and culture throughout the world and a rapid de-population of ireland in the second half of the 19th century . most of ireland seceded from the united kingdom after the irish war of independence and the subsequent anglo-irish treaty ( 1919-1922 ) , with six counties remaining in the uk as northern ireland .
gaddafi was notably confrontational in his approach to foreign powers , and generally shunned western ambassadors and diplomats , believing them to be spies . he once said that hiv was " a peaceful virus , not an aggressive virus " and assured attendees at the african union that " if you are straight you have nothing to fear from aids . " he also said that the h1n1 influenza virus was a biological weapon manufactured by a foreign military , and he assured africans that the tsetse fly and mosquito were " god 's armies which will protect us against colonialists . " should these ' enemies ' come to africa , " they will get malaria and sleeping sickness . "
several influential people of the time , including bell , viewed deafness as something that should be eradicated , and also believed that with resources and effort they could teach the deaf to speak and avoid the use of sign language , thus enabling their integration within the wider society from which many were often being excluded . in several schools , children were mistreated , for example by having their hands tied behind their backs so they could not communicate by signing - the only language they knew - in an attempt to force them to attempt oral communication . owing to his efforts to suppress the teaching of sign language , bell is often viewed negatively by those embracing deaf culture .
in mesoamerica , a similar set of events ( i.e. , crop domestication and sedentary lifestyles ) occurred by around 4500 bc , but possibly as early as 11,000-10,000 bc . these cultures are usually not referred to as belonging to the neolithic ; in america different terms are used such as formative stage instead of mid-late neolithic , archaic era instead of early neolithic and paleo-indian for the preceding period . the formative stage is equivalent to the neolithic revolution period in europe , asia , and africa . in the southwestern united states it occurred from 500 to 1200 c.e. when there was a dramatic increase in population and development of large villages supported by agriculture based on dryland farming of maize , and later , beans , squash , and domesticated turkeys . during this period the bow and arrow and ceramic pottery were also introduced .
in 2004 , philosopher and psychologist michel ter hark ( groningen , the netherlands ) published a book , called popper , otto selz and the rise of evolutionary epistemology , in which he claimed that popper took some of his ideas from his tutor , the german psychologist otto selz . selz never published his ideas , partly because of the rise of nazism , which forced him to quit his work in 1933 , and the prohibition of referring to selz ' work . popper , the historian of ideas and his scholarship , is criticised in some academic quarters for his rejection of plato , hegel and marx .

though the true dimensions of species diversity remain uncertain , estimates range from 2.6-7.8 million species with a mean of 5.5 million . this probably represents less than 20 % of all species on earth [ citation needed ] , and with only about 20,000 new species of all organisms being described each year , most species likely will remain undescribed for many years unless species descriptions increase in rate . about 850,000-1,000,000 of all described species are insects . of the 24 orders of insects , four dominate in terms of numbers of described species , with at least 3 million species included in coleoptera , diptera , hymenoptera and lepidoptera . a recent study estimated the number of beetles at 0.9-2.1 million with a mean of 1.5 million .
in addition to setting the international law , the united nations initiated international program on the elimination of child labour ( ipec ) in 1992 . this initiative aims to progressively eliminate child labour through strengthening national capacities to address some of the causes of child labour . amongst the key initiative is the so-called time-bounded programme countries , where child labour is most prevalent and schooling opportunities lacking . the initiative seeks to achieve amongst other things , universal primary school availability . the ipec has expanded to at least the following target countries : bangladesh , brazil , china , egypt , india , indonesia , mexico , nigeria , pakistan , democratic republic of congo , el salvador , nepal , tanzania , dominican republic , costa rica , philippines , senegal , south africa and turkey .

a tile mosaic is a digital image made up of individual tiles , arranged in a non-overlapping fashion , e.g. to make a static image on a shower room or bathing pool floor , by breaking the image down into square pixels formed from ceramic tiles ( a typical size is 1 in × 1 in ( 25 mm × 25 mm ) , as for example , on the floor of the university of toronto pool , though sometimes larger tiles such as 2 in × 2 in ( 51 mm × 51 mm ) are used ) . these digital images are coarse in resolution and often simply express text , such as the depth of the pool in various places , but some such digital images are used to show a sunset or other beach theme .
on april 7 , 1989 , soviet troops and armored personnel carriers were sent to tbilisi after more than 100,000 people protested in front of communist party headquarters with banners calling for georgia to secede from the soviet union and for abkhazia to be fully integrated into georgia . on april 9 , 1989 , troops attacked the demonstrators ; some 20 people were killed and more than 200 wounded . this event radicalized georgian politics , prompting many to conclude that independence was preferable to continued soviet rule . on april 14 , gorbachev removed jumber patiashvili as first secretary of the georgian communist party and replaced him with former georgian kgb chief givi gumbaridze .
st. patrick 's street , the main street of the city which was remodelled in the mid-2000s , is known for the architecture of the buildings along its pedestrian-friendly route and is the main shopping thoroughfare . the reason for its curved shape is that it originally was a channel of the river lee that was built over on arches . the general post office , with its limestone facade , is on oliver plunkett street , on the site of the theatre royal which was built in 1760 and burned down in 1840 . the english circus proprietor pablo fanque rebuilt an amphitheatre on the spot in 1850 , which was subsequently transformed into a theatre and then into the present general post office in 1877 . the grand parade is a tree-lined avenue , home to offices , shops and financial institutions . the old financial centre is the south mall , with several banks whose interior derive from the 19th century , such as the allied irish bank 's which was once an exchange .

the titles of state supreme court vary , which can cause confusion between jurisdictions because one state may use a name for its highest court that another uses for a lower court . in new york , maryland , and the district of columbia the highest court is called the court of appeals , a name used by many states for their intermediate appellate courts . further , trial courts of general jurisdiction in new york are called the supreme court , and the intermediate appellate court is called the supreme court , appellate division . in west virginia , the highest court of the state is the supreme court of appeals . in maine and massachusetts the highest court is styled the " supreme judicial court " ; the last is the oldest appellate court of continuous operation in the western hemisphere .
another study on men and women 's patterns of sexual arousal confirmed that men and women have different patterns of arousal , independent of their sexual orientations . the study found that women 's genitals become aroused to both human and nonhuman stimuli from movies showing humans of both genders having sex ( heterosexual and homosexual ) and from videos showing non-human primates ( bonobos ) having sex . men did not show any sexual arousal to non-human visual stimuli , their arousal patterns being in line with their specific sexual interest ( women for heterosexual men and men for homosexual men ) .

the times used contributions from significant figures in the fields of politics , science , literature , and the arts to build its reputation . for much of its early life , the profits of the times were very large and the competition minimal , so it could pay far better than its rivals for information or writers . beginning in 1814 , the paper was printed on the new steam-driven cylinder press developed by friedrich koenig . in 1815 , the times had a circulation of 5,000 .

the yiddish linguist max weinreich published the expression , a shprakh iz a dialekt mit an armey un flot ( " א שפראך איז א דיאלעקט מיט אן ארמײ און פלאט " : " a language is a dialect with an army and navy " ) in yivo bleter 25.1 , 1945 , p . 13 . the significance of the political factors in any attempt at answering the question " what is a language ? " is great enough to cast doubt on whether any strictly linguistic definition , without a socio-cultural approach , is possible . this is illustrated by the frequency with which the army-navy aphorism is cited .
some insects use parthenogenesis , a process in which the female can reproduce and give birth without having the eggs fertilized by a male . many aphids undergo a form of parthenogenesis , called cyclical parthenogenesis , in which they alternate between one or many generations of asexual and sexual reproduction . in summer , aphids are generally female and parthenogenetic ; in the autumn , males may be produced for sexual reproduction . other insects produced by parthenogenesis are bees , wasps and ants , in which they spawn males . however , overall , most individuals are female , which are produced by fertilization . the males are haploid and the females are diploid . more rarely , some insects display hermaphroditism , in which a given individual has both male and female reproductive organs .
the city has undergone many changes to its governance over the centuries and once again became administratively independent from hampshire county as it was made into a unitary authority in a local government reorganisation on 1 april 1997 , a result of the 1992 local government act . the district remains part of the hampshire ceremonial county .
t. gilmartin , ( professor of history , maynooth , 1890 ) , writes in church history , vol . 1 , ch xvii : the arians sought the approval of an ecumenical council . they sought to hold two councils . constantius , summoned the bishops of the east to meet at seleucia in isauria , and those of the west to rimini in italy . a preliminary conference was held by the arians at sirmium , to agree a formula of faith . a " homoeon " creed was adopted , declaring the son to be " like the father . " the two met in autumn of 359 . at seleucia , one hundred and fifty bishops , of which one hundred and five were semi-arian . the semi-arians refused to accept anything less than the " homoiousion , " ( see : homoiousian ) , formulary of faith . the imperial prefect was obliged to disband , without agreeing on any creed . acacius , the leader of the " homoean " party went to constantinople , where the sirmian formulary of faith was approved by the " home synod , " ( consisted of those bishops who happened to be present at the court for the time ) , and a decree of deposition issued against the leaders of the semi-arians . at rimini were over four hundred of which eighty were arian , the rest were orthodox . the orthodox fathers refused to accept any creed but the nicene , while the others were equally in favour of the sirmian . each party sent a deputation to the emperor to say there was no probability to agreement , and asked for the bishops to return to their dioceses . for the purpose of wearing-down the orthodox bishops ; ( sulpitius severius says ) , constantius delayed his answer for several months , and finally prevailed on them to accept the sirmian creed . it was after this council that jerome said : " ... the whole world groaned in astonishment to find itself arian . "
the gas centrifuge process , where gaseous uranium hexafluoride ( uf6 ) is separated by the difference in molecular weight between 235uf6 and 238uf6 using high-speed centrifuges , is the cheapest and leading enrichment process . the gaseous diffusion process had been the leading method for enrichment and was used in the manhattan project . in this process , uranium hexafluoride is repeatedly diffused through a silver-zinc membrane , and the different isotopes of uranium are separated by diffusion rate ( since uranium 238 is heavier it diffuses slightly slower than uranium-235 ) . the molecular laser isotope separation method employs a laser beam of precise energy to sever the bond between uranium-235 and fluorine . this leaves uranium-238 bonded to fluorine and allows uranium-235 metal to precipitate from the solution . an alternative laser method of enrichment is known as atomic vapor laser isotope separation ( avlis ) and employs visible tunable lasers such as dye lasers . another method used is liquid thermal diffusion .
immanuel kant ( 1724-1804 ) tried to reconcile rationalism and religious belief , individual freedom and political authority , as well as map out a view of the public sphere through private and public reason . kant 's work continued to shape german thought , and indeed all of european philosophy , well into the 20th century . mary wollstonecraft was one of england 's earliest feminist philosophers . she argued for a society based on reason , and that women , as well as men , should be treated as rational beings . she is best known for her work a vindication of the rights of woman ( 1791 ) .
irish , italians , polish , germans , english , and greeks are the largest ethnic european groups in the city . philadelphia has the second-largest irish and italian populations in the united states , after new york city . south philadelphia remains one of the largest italian neighborhoods in the country and is home to the italian market . the pennsport neighborhood and gray 's ferry section of south philadelphia , home to many mummer clubs , are well known as irish neighborhoods . the kensington section , port richmond , and fishtown have historically been heavily irish and polish . port richmond is well known in particular as the center of the polish immigrant and polish-american community in philadelphia , and it remains a common destination for polish immigrants . northeast philadelphia , although known for its irish and irish-american population , is also home to a large jewish and russian population . mount airy in northwest philadelphia also contains a large jewish community , while nearby chestnut hill is historically known as an anglo-saxon protestant stronghold .

at the age of 19 , he wrote a report on his work and sent it to philologist alexander ellis , a colleague of his father ( who would later be portrayed as professor henry higgins in pygmalion ) . ellis immediately wrote back indicating that the experiments were similar to existing work in germany , and also lent bell a copy of hermann von helmholtz 's work , the sensations of tone as a physiological basis for the theory of music .
the second major event of the early reign of abd al-malik was the construction of the dome of the rock in jerusalem . although the chronology remains somewhat uncertain , the building seems to have been completed in 692 , which means that it was under construction during the conflict with ibn al-zubayr . this had led some historians , both medieval and modern , to suggest that the dome of the rock was built as a destination for pilgrimage to rival the kaaba , which was under the control of ibn al-zubayr .

jehovah 's witnesses have been accused of having policies and culture that help to conceal cases of sexual abuse within the organization . the religion has been criticized for its " two witness rule " for church discipline , based on its application of scriptures at deuteronomy 19 : 15 and matthew 18 : 15-17 , which requires sexual abuse to be substantiated by secondary evidence if the accused person denies any wrongdoing . in cases where corroboration is lacking , the watch tower society 's instruction is that " the elders will leave the matter in jehovah 's hands . " a former member of the church 's headquarters staff , barbara anderson , says the policy effectively requires that there be another witness to an act of molestation , " which is an impossibility . " anderson says the policies " protect pedophiles rather than protect the children . " jehovah 's witnesses maintain that they have a strong policy to protect children , adding that the best way to protect children is by educating parents ; they also state that they do not sponsor activities that separate children from parents .
the internal classification of this group has undergone considerable revision . the cronquist system , proposed by arthur cronquist in 1968 and published in its full form in 1981 , is still widely used but is no longer believed to accurately reflect phylogeny . a consensus about how the flowering plants should be arranged has recently begun to emerge through the work of the angiosperm phylogeny group ( apg ) , which published an influential reclassification of the angiosperms in 1998 . updates incorporating more recent research were published as apg ii in 2003 and as apg iii in 2009 .
cardinals elevated to the diaconal order are mainly officials of the roman curia holding various posts in the church administration . their number and influence has varied through the years . while historically predominantly italian the group has become much more internationally diverse in later years . while in 1939 about half were italian by 1994 the number was reduced to one third . their influence in the election of the pope has been considered important , they are better informed and connected than the dislocated cardinals but their level of unity has been varied . under the 1587 decree of pope sixtus v , which fixed the maximum size of the college of cardinals , there were 14 cardinal deacons . later the number increased . as late as 1939 almost half of the cardinals were members of the curia . pius xii reduced this percentage to 24 percent . john xxiii brought it back up to 37 percent but paul vi brought it down to 27 percent where john paul ii has maintained this ratio .
the first few naval battles were disasters for rome . however , after training more sailors and inventing a grappling engine , a roman naval force was able to defeat a carthaginian fleet , and further naval victories followed . the carthaginians then hired xanthippus of carthage , a spartan mercenary general , to reorganise and lead their army . he cut off the roman army from its base by re-establishing carthaginian naval supremacy . the romans then again defeated the carthaginians in naval battle at the battle of the aegates islands and left carthage with neither a fleet nor sufficient coin to raise one . for a maritime power the loss of their access to the mediterranean stung financially and psychologically , and the carthaginians sued for peace .

despite competition from other materials , copper remains the preferred electrical conductor in nearly all categories of electrical wiring with the major exception being overhead electric power transmission where aluminium is often preferred . copper wire is used in power generation , power transmission , power distribution , telecommunications , electronics circuitry , and countless types of electrical equipment . electrical wiring is the most important market for the copper industry . this includes building wire , communications cable , power distribution cable , appliance wire , automotive wire and cable , and magnet wire . roughly half of all copper mined is used to manufacture electrical wire and cable conductors . many electrical devices rely on copper wiring because of its multitude of inherent beneficial properties , such as its high electrical conductivity , tensile strength , ductility , creep ( deformation ) resistance , corrosion resistance , low thermal expansion , high thermal conductivity , solderability , and ease of installation .
in 1798 , the revolutionary french government conquered switzerland and imposed a new unified constitution . this centralised the government of the country , effectively abolishing the cantons : moreover , mulhausen joined france and valtellina valley , the cisalpine republic , separating from switzerland . the new regime , known as the helvetic republic , was highly unpopular . it had been imposed by a foreign invading army and destroyed centuries of tradition , making switzerland nothing more than a french satellite state . the fierce french suppression of the nidwalden revolt in september 1798 was an example of the oppressive presence of the french army and the local population 's resistance to the occupation .
the production arm of the studio still struggled . while there were to be a few hits like the killers ( 1946 ) and the naked city ( 1948 ) , universal-international 's new theatrical films often met with disappointing response at the box office . by the late 1940s , goetz was out , and the studio returned to low-budget films . the inexpensive francis ( 1950 ) , the first film of a series about a talking mule and ma and pa kettle ( 1949 ) , part of a series , became mainstays of the company . once again , the films of abbott and costello , including abbott and costello meet frankenstein ( 1948 ) , were among the studio 's top-grossing productions . but at this point rank lost interest and sold his shares to the investor milton rackmil , whose decca records would take full control of universal in 1952 . besides abbott and costello , the studio retained the walter lantz cartoon studio , whose product was released with universal-international 's films .

bacteria can be grown in the laboratory on nutrient culture media , but viruses need living cells in which to replicate . many vaccines to infectious diseases can be grown in fertilised chicken eggs . millions of eggs are used each year to generate the annual flu vaccine requirements , a complex process that takes about six months after the decision is made as to what strains of virus to include in the new vaccine . a problem with using eggs for this purpose is that people with egg allergies are unable to be immunised , but this disadvantage may be overcome as new techniques for cell-based rather than egg-based culture become available . cell-based culture will also be useful in a pandemic when it may be difficult to acquire a sufficiently large quantity of suitable sterile , fertile eggs .
subsequently with the disgrace of " near east " in diplomatic and military circles , " middle east " prevailed . however , " near east " continues in some circles at the discretion of the defining agency or academic department . they are not generally considered distinct regions as they were at their original definition .
many older buildings in certain areas of boston are supported by wooden piles driven into the area 's fill ; these piles remain sound if submerged in water , but are subject to dry rot if exposed to air for long periods . groundwater levels have been dropping , to varying degrees , in many areas of the city , due in part to an increase in the amount of rainwater discharged directly into sewers rather than absorbed by the ground . a city agency , the boston groundwater trust , coordinates monitoring of groundwater levels throughout the city via a network of public and private monitoring wells . however , boston 's drinking water supply , from the quabbin and wachusett reservoirs to the west , is one of the very few in the country so pure as to satisfy federal water quality standards without filtration .
tourism contributes billions of dollars each year to the state 's economy and tennessee is ranked among the top 10 destinations in the us . in 2014 a record 100 million people visited the state resulting in $ 17.7 billion in tourism related spending within the state , an increase of 6.3 % over 2013 ; tax revenue from tourism equaled $ 1.5 billion . each county in tennessee saw at least $ 1 million from tourism while 19 counties received at least $ 100 million ( davidson , shelby , and sevier counties were the top three ) . tourism-generated jobs for the state reached 152,900 , a 2.8 % increase . international travelers to tennessee accounted for $ 533 million in spending .
after several weeks of rumors , which started around january 11 , 2013 , dell announced on february 5 , 2013 that it had struck a $ 24.4 billion leveraged buyout deal , that would have delisted its shares from the nasdaq and hong kong stock exchange and taken it private . reuters reported that michael dell and silver lake partners , aided by a $ 2 billion loan from microsoft , would acquire the public shares at $ 13.65 apiece . the $ 24.4 billion buyout was projected to be the largest leveraged buyout backed by private equity since the 2007 financial crisis . it is also the largest technology buyout ever , surpassing the 2006 buyout of freescale semiconductor for $ 17.5 billion .
by the end of the 12th century , paris had become the political , economic , religious , and cultural capital of france . the ile de la cite was the site of the royal palace . in 1163 , during the reign of louis vii , maurice de sully , bishop of paris , undertook the construction of the notre dame cathedral at its eastern extremity . the left bank was the site of the university of paris , a corporation of students and teachers formed in the mid-12th century to train scholars first in theology , and later in canon law , medicine and the arts .

puerto rico is designated in its constitution as the " commonwealth of puerto rico . " the constitution of puerto rico which became effective in 1952 adopted the name of estado libre asociado ( literally translated as " free associated state " ) , officially translated into english as commonwealth , for its body politic . the island is under the jurisdiction of the territorial clause of the u.s. constitution , which has led to doubts about the finality of the commonwealth status for puerto rico . in addition , all people born in puerto rico become citizens of the u.s. at birth ( under provisions of the jones-shafroth act in 1917 ) , but citizens residing in puerto rico cannot vote for president nor for full members of either house of congress . statehood would grant island residents full voting rights at the federal level . the puerto rico democracy act ( h.r. 2499 ) was approved on april 29 , 2010 , by the united states house of representatives 223-169 , but was not approved by the senate before the end of the 111th congress . it would have provided for a federally sanctioned self-determination process for the people of puerto rico . this act would provide for referendums to be held in puerto rico to determine the island 's ultimate political status . it had also been introduced in 2007 .
the current mac product family uses intel x86-64 processors . apple introduced an emulator during the transition from powerpc chips ( called rosetta ) , much as it did during the transition from motorola 68000 architecture a decade earlier . the macintosh is the only mainstream computer platform to have successfully transitioned to a new cpu architecture , and has done so twice . all current mac models ship with at least 8 gb of ram as standard other than the 1.4 ghz mac mini , macbook pro ( without retina display ) , and macbook air . current mac computers use ati radeon or nvidia geforce graphics cards as well as intel graphics built into the main cpu . all current macs ( except for the macbook pro without retina display ) do not ship with an optical media drive that includes a dual-function dvd / cd burner . apple refers to this as a superdrive . current macs include two standard data transfer ports : usb and thunderbolt ( except for the macbook ( 2015 version ) , which only has a usb-c port and headphone port ) . macbook pro , imac , macbook air , and mac mini computers now also feature the " thunderbolt " port , which apple says can transfer data at speeds up to 10 gigabits per second . usb was introduced in the 1998 imac g3 and is ubiquitous today , while firewire is mainly reserved for high-performance devices such as hard drives or video cameras . starting with the then-new imac g5 , released in october 2005 , apple started to include built-in isight cameras on appropriate models , and a media center interface called front row that can be operated by an apple remote or keyboard for accessing media stored on the computer . front row has been discontinued as of 2011 , however , and the apple remote is no longer bundled with new macs .
lancashire emerged as a major commercial and industrial region during the industrial revolution . manchester and liverpool grew into its largest cities , dominating global trade and the birth of modern capitalism . the county contained several mill towns and the collieries of the lancashire coalfield . by the 1830s , approximately 85 % of all cotton manufactured worldwide was processed in lancashire . accrington , blackburn , bolton , burnley , bury , chorley , colne , darwen , nelson , oldham , preston , rochdale and wigan were major cotton mill towns during this time . blackpool was a centre for tourism for the inhabitants of lancashire 's mill towns , particularly during wakes week .
chopin made his last public appearance on a concert platform at london 's guildhall on 16 november 1848 , when , in a final patriotic gesture , he played for the benefit of polish refugees . by this time he was very seriously ill , weighing under 99 pounds ( i.e. less than 45 kg ) , and his doctors were aware that his sickness was at a terminal stage .
the kushan empire expanded out of what is now afghanistan into the northwest of the subcontinent under the leadership of their first emperor , kujula kadphises , about the middle of the 1st century ce . they came of an indo-european language speaking central asian tribe called the yuezhi , a branch of which was known as the kushans . by the time of his grandson , kanishka , they had conquered most of northern india , at least as far as saketa and pataliputra , in the middle ganges valley , and probably as far as the bay of bengal .
the word " public " implies the highest level of inclusivity - the public sphere by definition should be open to all . however , this sphere was only public to relative degrees . enlightenment thinkers frequently contrasted their conception of the " public " with that of the people : condorcet contrasted " opinion " with populace , marmontel " the opinion of men of letters " with " the opinion of the multitude , " and d 'alembert the " truly enlightened public " with " the blind and noisy multitude . " additionally , most institutions of the public sphere excluded both women and the lower classes . cross-class influences occurred through noble and lower class participation in areas such as the coffeehouses and the masonic lodges .
prior to 1992 , armenians would participate in the olympics representing the ussr . as part of the soviet union , armenia was very successful , winning plenty of medals and helping the ussr win the medal standings at the olympics on numerous occasions . the first medal won by an armenian in modern olympic history was by hrant shahinyan ( sometimes spelled as grant shaginyan ) , who won two golds and two silvers in gymnastics at the 1952 summer olympics in helsinki . to highlight the level of success of armenians in the olympics , shahinyan was quoted as saying :
beginning as a self-help program in the mid-1960s , the cotton research and promotion program ( crpp ) was organized by u.s. cotton producers in response to cotton 's steady decline in market share . at that time , producers voted to set up a per-bale assessment system to fund the program , with built-in safeguards to protect their investments . with the passage of the cotton research and promotion act of 1966 , the program joined forces and began battling synthetic competitors and re-establishing markets for cotton . today , the success of this program has made cotton the best-selling fiber in the u.s. and one of the best-selling fibers in the world .

in congregational and presbyterian churches which profess a traditionally calvinist or reformed theology there are differing views regarding present-day continuation or cessation of the gifts ( charismata ) of the spirit . generally , however , reformed charismatics distance themselves from renewal movements with tendencies which could be perceived as overemotional , such as word of faith , toronto blessing , brownsville revival and lakeland revival . prominent reformed charismatic denominations are the sovereign grace churches and the every nation churches in the usa , in great britain there is the newfrontiers churches and movement , which leading figure is terry virgo .
during his term as praetor in the iberian peninsula ( modern portugal and spain ) , pompey 's contemporary julius caesar defeated two local tribes in battle . after his term as consul in 59 bc , he was appointed to a five-year term as the proconsular governor of cisalpine gaul ( part of current northern italy ) , transalpine gaul ( current southern france ) and illyria ( part of the modern balkans ) . not content with an idle governorship , caesar strove to find reason to invade gaul ( modern france and belgium ) , which would give him the dramatic military success he sought . when two local tribes began to migrate on a route that would take them near ( not into ) the roman province of transalpine gaul , caesar had the barely sufficient excuse he needed for his gallic wars , fought between 58 bc and 49 bc .

the constitution of jordan grants its monarch the right to withhold assent to laws passed by its parliament . article 93 of that document gives the jordanian sovereign six months to sign or veto any legislation sent to him from the national assembly ; if he vetoes it within that timeframe , the assembly may override his veto by a two-thirds vote of both houses ; otherwise , the law does not go into effect ( but it may be reconsidered in the next session of the assembly ) . if the monarch fails to act within six months of the bill being presented to him , it becomes law without his signature .
the 1960s were less successful for the club , with real madrid monopolising la liga . the completion of the camp nou , finished in 1957 , meant the club had little money to spend on new players . the 1960s saw the emergence of josep maria fuste and carles rexach , and the club won the copa del generalisimo in 1963 and the fairs cup in 1966 . barcelona restored some pride by beating real madrid 1-0 in the 1968 copa del generalisimo final at the bernabeu in front of franco , with coach salvador artigas , a former republican pilot in the civil war . with the end of franco 's dictatorship in 1974 , the club changed its official name back to futbol club barcelona and reverted the crest to its original design , including the original letters once again .
with 39,000 acres ( 158 km2 ) , the tallgrass prairie preserve in north-central oklahoma is the largest protected area of tallgrass prairie in the world and is part of an ecosystem that encompasses only 10 percent of its former land area , once covering 14 states . in addition , the black kettle national grassland covers 31,300 acres ( 127 km2 ) of prairie in southwestern oklahoma . the wichita mountains wildlife refuge is the oldest and largest of nine national wildlife refuges in the state and was founded in 1901 , encompassing 59,020 acres ( 238.8 km2 ) .
as well as being head of government , a prime minister may have other roles or titles - the prime minister of the united kingdom , for example , is also first lord of the treasury and minister for the civil service . prime ministers may take other ministerial posts - for example , during the second world war , winston churchill was also minister of defence ( although there was then no ministry of defence ) , and in the current cabinet of israel , benjamin netanyahu also serves as minister of communications , foreign affairs , regional cooperation , economy and interior
the northwestern university law review is a scholarly legal publication and student organization at northwestern university school of law . the law review 's primary purpose is to publish a journal of broad legal scholarship . the law review publishes four issues each year . student editors make the editorial and organizational decisions and select articles submitted by professors , judges , and practitioners , as well as student pieces . the law review recently extended its presence onto the web , and now publishes scholarly pieces weekly on the colloquy . the northwestern journal of technology and intellectual property is a law review published by an independent student organization at northwestern university school of law . its bluebook abbreviation is nw . j. tech . & intell . prop . the current editor-in-chief is aisha lavinier .
lossy audio compression is used in a wide range of applications . in addition to the direct applications ( mp3 players or computers ) , digitally compressed audio streams are used in most video dvds , digital television , streaming media on the internet , satellite and cable radio , and increasingly in terrestrial radio broadcasts . lossy compression typically achieves far greater compression than lossless compression ( data of 5 percent to 20 percent of the original stream , rather than 50 percent to 60 percent ) , by discarding less-critical data .
in response to attribution of recent climate change , the city of melbourne , in 2002 , set a target to reduce carbon emissions to net zero by 2020 and moreland city council established the zero moreland program , however not all metropolitan municipalities have followed , with the city of glen eira notably deciding in 2009 not to become carbon neutral . melbourne has one of the largest urban footprints in the world due to its low density housing , resulting in a vast suburban sprawl , with a high level of car dependence and minimal public transport outside of inner areas . much of the vegetation within the city are non-native species , most of european origin , and in many cases plays host to invasive species and noxious weeds . significant introduced urban pests include the common myna , feral pigeon , brown rat , european wasp , common starling and red fox . many outlying suburbs , particularly towards the yarra valley and the hills to the north-east and east , have gone for extended periods without regenerative fires leading to a lack of saplings and undergrowth in urbanised native bushland . the department of sustainability and environment partially addresses this problem by regularly burning off . several national parks have been designated around the urban area of melbourne , including the mornington peninsula national park , port phillip heads marine national park and point nepean national park in the south east , organ pipes national park to the north and dandenong ranges national park to the east . there are also a number of significant state parks just outside melbourne . responsibility for regulating pollution falls under the jurisdiction of the epa victoria and several local councils . air pollution , by world standards , is classified as being good . summer and autumn are the worst times of year for atmospheric haze in the urban area .
the gorals of southern poland and northern slovakia are partially descended from romance-speaking vlachs who migrated into the region from the 14th to 17th centuries and were absorbed into the local population . the population of moravian wallachia also descend of this population .
prior to einstein 's paper , electromagnetic radiation such as visible light was considered to behave as a wave : hence the use of the terms " frequency " and " wavelength " to characterise different types of radiation . the energy transferred by a wave in a given time is called its intensity . the light from a theatre spotlight is more intense than the light from a domestic lightbulb ; that is to say that the spotlight gives out more energy per unit time and per unit space ( and hence consumes more electricity ) than the ordinary bulb , even though the colour of the light might be very similar . other waves , such as sound or the waves crashing against a seafront , also have their own intensity . however , the energy account of the photoelectric effect didn 't seem to agree with the wave description of light .
comcast has also earned a reputation for being anti-union . according to one of the company 's training manuals , " comcast does not feel union representation is in the best interest of its employees , customers , or shareholders . " a dispute in 2004 with cwa , a labor union that represented many employees at comcast 's offices in beaverton , oregon , led to allegations of management intimidating workers , requiring them to attend anti-union meetings and unwarranted disciplinary action for union members . in 2011 , comcast received criticism from writers guild of america for its policies in regards to unions .
the rohingya people have consistently faced human rights abuses by the burmese regime that has refused to acknowledge them as burmese citizens ( despite some of them having lived in burma for over three generations ) - the rohingya have been denied burmese citizenship since the enactment of a 1982 citizenship law . the law created three categories of citizenship : citizenship , associate citizenship , and naturalised citizenship . citizenship is given to those who belong to one of the national races such as kachin , kayah ( karenni ) , karen , chin , burman , mon , rakhine , shan , kaman , or zerbadee . associate citizenship is given to those who cannot prove their ancestors settled in myanmar before 1823 , but can prove they have one grandparent , or pre-1823 ancestor , who was a citizen of another country , as well as people who applied for citizenship in 1948 and qualified then by those laws . naturalized citizenship is only given to those who have at least one parent with one of these types of burmese citizenship or can provide " conclusive evidence " that their parents entered and resided in burma prior to independence in 1948 . the burmese regime has attempted to forcibly expel rohingya and bring in non-rohingyas to replace them - this policy has resulted in the expulsion of approximately half of the 800,000 rohingya from burma , while the rohingya people have been described as " among the world 's least wanted " and " one of the world 's most persecuted minorities . " but the origin of " most persecuted minority ' statement is unclear .
ibn sina wrote extensively on early islamic philosophy , especially the subjects logic , ethics , and metaphysics , including treatises named logic and metaphysics . most of his works were written in arabic - then the language of science in the middle east - and some in persian . of linguistic significance even to this day are a few books that he wrote in nearly pure persian language ( particularly the danishnamah-yi ' ala ' , philosophy for ala ' ad-dawla ' ) . ibn sina 's commentaries on aristotle often criticized the philosopher , [ citation needed ] encouraging a lively debate in the spirit of ijtihad .
outstanding debts were also agreed and the company permitted to export 250 tons of saltpetre . again in 1673 , banks successfully negotiated another contract for 700 tons of saltpetre at £ 37,000 between the king and the company . so urgent was the need to supply the armed forces in the united kingdom , america and elsewhere that the authorities sometimes turned a blind eye on the untaxed sales . one governor of the company was even reported as saying in 1864 that he would rather have the saltpetre made than the tax on salt .
the only extant depiction of edward 's abbey , together with the adjacent palace of westminster , is in the bayeux tapestry . some of the lower parts of the monastic dormitory , an extension of the south transept , survive in the norman undercroft of the great school , including a door said to come from the previous saxon abbey . increased endowments supported a community increased from a dozen monks in dunstan 's original foundation , up to a maximum about eighty monks , although there was also a large community of lay brothers who supported the monastery 's extensive property and activities .
the predominant school of thought in the 13th century was the thomistic reconciliation of the teachings of aristotle with christian theology . the condemnation of 1277 , enacted at the university of paris , placed restrictions on ideas that could be interpreted as heretical ; restrictions that had implication for aristotelian thought . an alternative was presented by william of ockham , who insisted that the world of reason and the world of faith had to be kept apart . ockham introduced the principle of parsimony - or occam 's razor - whereby a simple theory is preferred to a more complex one , and speculation on unobservable phenomena is avoided .
sporadic use of the term for some of the subject matter occurred subsequently , such as the use by etienne serres in 1838 to describe the natural history , or paleontology , of man , based on comparative anatomy , and the creation of a chair in anthropology and ethnography in 1850 at the national museum of natural history ( france ) by jean louis armand de quatrefages de breau . various short-lived organizations of anthropologists had already been formed . the societe ethnologique de paris , the first to use ethnology , was formed in 1839 . its members were primarily anti-slavery activists . when slavery was abolished in france in 1848 the societe was abandoned .
large numbers of bolivian highland peasants retained indigenous language , culture , customs , and communal organization throughout the spanish conquest and the post-independence period . they mobilized to resist various attempts at the dissolution of communal landholdings and used legal recognition of " empowered caciques " to further communal organization . indigenous revolts took place frequently until 1953 . while the national revolutionary movement government begun in 1952 discouraged self-identification as indigenous ( reclassifying rural people as campesinos , or peasants ) , renewed ethnic and class militancy re-emerged in the katarista movement beginning in the 1970s . lowland indigenous peoples , mostly in the east , entered national politics through the 1990 march for territory and dignity organized by the cidob confederation . that march successfully pressured the national government to sign the ilo convention 169 and to begin the still-ongoing process of recognizing and titling indigenous territories . the 1994 law of popular participation granted " grassroots territorial organizations " that are recognized by the state certain rights to govern local areas .
plymouth is home to the marine biological association of the united kingdom ( mba ) which conducts research in all areas of the marine sciences . the plymouth marine laboratory is an offshoot of the mba . together with the national marine aquarium , the sir alister hardy foundation for ocean sciences , plymouth university 's marine institute and the diving diseases research centre , these marine-related organisations form the plymouth marine sciences partnership . the plymouth marine laboratory , which focuses on global issues of climate change and sustainability . it monitors the effects of ocean acidity on corals and shellfish and reports the results to the uk government . it also cultivates algae that could be used to make biofuels or in the treatment of waste water by using technology such as photo-bioreactors . it works alongside the boots group to investigate the use of algae in skin care protects , taking advantage of the chemicals they contain that adapt to protect themselves from the sun .
in 1725 yongzheng bestowed the hereditary title of marquis on a descendant of the ming dynasty imperial family , zhu zhiliang , who received a salary from the qing government and whose duty was to perform rituals at the ming tombs , and was also inducted the chinese plain white banner in the eight banners . later the qianlong emperor bestowed the title marquis of extended grace posthumously on zhu zhuliang in 1750 , and the title passed on through twelve generations of ming descendants until the end of the qing dynasty .
from november 17 , 1947 to december 23 , 1947 , john bardeen and walter brattain at at & t 's bell labs in the united states performed experiments and observed that when two gold point contacts were applied to a crystal of germanium , a signal was produced with the output power greater than the input . solid state physics group leader william shockley saw the potential in this , and over the next few months worked to greatly expand the knowledge of semiconductors . the term transistor was coined by john r. pierce as a contraction of the term transresistance . according to lillian hoddeson and vicki daitch , authors of a biography of john bardeen , shockley had proposed that bell labs ' first patent for a transistor should be based on the field-effect and that he be named as the inventor . having unearthed lilienfeld 's patents that went into obscurity years earlier , lawyers at bell labs advised against shockley 's proposal because the idea of a field-effect transistor that used an electric field as a " grid " was not new . instead , what bardeen , brattain , and shockley invented in 1947 was the first point-contact transistor . in acknowledgement of this accomplishment , shockley , bardeen , and brattain were jointly awarded the 1956 nobel prize in physics " for their researches on semiconductors and their discovery of the transistor effect . "
a series of experiments performed from the late 1800s to the early 1900s revealed that diabetes is caused by the absence of a substance normally produced by the pancreas . in 1869 , oskar minkowski and joseph von mering found that diabetes could be induced in dogs by surgical removal of the pancreas . in 1921 , canadian professor frederick banting and his student charles best repeated this study , and found that injections of pancreatic extract reversed the symptoms produced by pancreas removal . soon , the extract was demonstrated to work in people , but development of insulin therapy as a routine medical procedure was delayed by difficulties in producing the material in sufficient quantity and with reproducible purity . the researchers sought assistance from industrial collaborators at eli lilly and co. based on the company 's experience with large scale purification of biological materials . chemist george walden of eli lilly and company found that careful adjustment of the ph of the extract allowed a relatively pure grade of insulin to be produced . under pressure from toronto university and a potential patent challenge by academic scientists who had independently developed a similar purification method , an agreement was reached for non-exclusive production of insulin by multiple companies . prior to the discovery and widespread availability of insulin therapy the life expectancy of diabetics was only a few months .
after the disappointment of the gaspart era , the combination of a new young president , joan laporta , and a young new manager , former dutch and milan star frank rijkaard , saw the club bounce back . on the field , an influx of international players , including ronaldinho , deco , henrik larsson , ludovic giuly , samuel eto 'o , and rafael marquez , combined with home grown spanish players , such as carles puyol , andres iniesta , xavi and victor valdes , led to the club 's return to success . barcelona won la liga and the supercopa de espana in 2004-05 , and ronaldinho and eto 'o were voted first and third , respectively , in the fifa world player of the year awards .
buddhism / ˈbudɪzəm / is a nontheistic religion [ note 1 ] or philosophy ( sanskrit : धर  म dharma ; pali : धम  म dhamma ) that encompasses a variety of traditions , beliefs and spiritual practices largely based on teachings attributed to gautama buddha , commonly known as the buddha ( " the awakened one " ) . according to buddhist tradition , the buddha lived and taught in the eastern part of the indian subcontinent , present-day nepal sometime between the 6th and 4th centuries bce . [ note 1 ] he is recognized by buddhists as an awakened or enlightened teacher who shared his insights to help sentient beings end their suffering through the elimination of ignorance and craving . buddhists believe that this is accomplished through the direct understanding and perception of dependent origination and the four noble truths .
on january 10 , 2007 , the national archives and fold3.com ( formerly footnote ) launched a pilot project to digitize historic documents from the national archives holdings . allen weinstein explained that this partnership would " allow much greater access to approximately 4.5 million pages of important documents that are currently available only in their original format or on microfilm " and " would also enhance nara 's efforts to preserve its original records . "
cyborg anthropology originated as a sub-focus group within the american anthropological association 's annual meeting in 1993 . the sub-group was very closely related to sts and the society for the social studies of science . donna haraway 's 1985 cyborg manifesto could be considered the founding document of cyborg anthropology by first exploring the philosophical and sociological ramifications of the term . cyborg anthropology studies humankind and its relations with the technological systems it has built , specifically modern technological systems that have reflexively shaped notions of what it means to be human beings .
nato defines anti-aircraft warfare ( aaw ) as " measures taken to defend a maritime force against attacks by airborne weapons launched from aircraft , ships , submarines and land-based sites . " in some armies the term all-arms air defence ( aaad ) is used for air defence by non-specialist troops . other terms from the late 20th century include gbad ( ground based ad ) with related terms shorad ( short range ad ) and manpads ( " man portable ad systems " : typically shoulder-launched missiles ) . anti-aircraft missiles are variously called surface-to-air missile , abbreviated and pronounced " sam " and surface to air guided weapon ( sagw ) .
on april 12 , 1980 , a military coup led by master sergeant samuel doe of the krahn ethnic group overthrew and killed president william r. tolbert , jr .. doe and the other plotters later executed a majority of tolbert 's cabinet and other americo-liberian government officials and true whig party members . the coup leaders formed the people 's redemption council ( prc ) to govern the country . a strategic cold war ally of the west , doe received significant financial backing from the united states while critics condemned the prc for corruption and political repression .
the 10th century saw a mass migration of turkic tribes from central asia into the iranian plateau . turkic tribesmen were first used in the abbasid army as mamluks ( slave-warriors ) , replacing iranian and arab elements within the army . as a result , the mamluks gained a significant political power . in 999 , large portions of iran came briefly under the rule of the ghaznavids , whose rulers were of mamluk turk origin , and longer subsequently under the turkish seljuk and khwarezmian empires . these turks had been persianized and had adopted persian models of administration and rulership . the seljuks subsequently gave rise to the sultanate of rum in anatolia , while taking their thoroughly persianized identity with them . the result of the adoption and patronage of persian culture by turkish rulers was the development of a distinct turko-persian tradition .
primarily starting in the mid-1960s , london became a centre for the worldwide youth culture , exemplified by the swinging london subculture associated with the king 's road , chelsea and carnaby street . the role of trendsetter was revived during the punk era . in 1965 london 's political boundaries were expanded to take into account the growth of the urban area and a new greater london council was created . during the troubles in northern ireland , london was subjected to bombing attacks by the provisional ira . racial inequality was highlighted by the 1981 brixton riot .
unlike in multicellular organisms , increases in cell size ( cell growth ) and reproduction by cell division are tightly linked in unicellular organisms . bacteria grow to a fixed size and then reproduce through binary fission , a form of asexual reproduction . under optimal conditions , bacteria can grow and divide extremely rapidly , and bacterial populations can double as quickly as every 9.8 minutes . in cell division , two identical clone daughter cells are produced . some bacteria , while still reproducing asexually , form more complex reproductive structures that help disperse the newly formed daughter cells . examples include fruiting body formation by myxobacteria and aerial hyphae formation by streptomyces , or budding . budding involves a cell forming a protrusion that breaks away and produces a daughter cell .
a freedom of information request in 2005 revealed that eton had received £ 2,652 in farming subsidies in 2004 under the common agricultural policy . asked to explain under what grounds it was eligible to receive farming subsidies , eton admitted that it was ' a bit of a mystery ' . the taxpayers ' alliance also stated that eton had received a total of £ 5,300 in cap subsidies between 2002 and 2007 . panorama revealed in march 2012 that farming subsidies were granted to eton for ' environmental improvements ' , in effect ' being paid without having to do any farming at all ' .
the twilight zone tower of terror is the common name for a series of elevator attractions at the disney 's hollywood studios park in orlando , the disney california adventure park park in anaheim , the walt disney studios park in paris and the tokyo disneysea park in tokyo . the central element of this attraction is a simulated free-fall achieved through the use of a high-speed elevator system . for safety reasons , passengers are seated and secured in their seats rather than standing . unlike most traction elevators , the elevator car and counterweight are joined using a rail system in a continuous loop running through both the top and the bottom of the drop shaft . this allows the drive motor to pull down on the elevator car from underneath , resulting in downward acceleration greater than that of normal gravity . the high-speed drive motor is used to rapidly lift the elevator as well .
polarization is the sum of the e-plane orientations over time projected onto an imaginary plane perpendicular to the direction of motion of the radio wave . in the most general case , polarization is elliptical , meaning that the polarization of the radio waves varies over time . two special cases are linear polarization ( the ellipse collapses into a line ) as we have discussed above , and circular polarization ( in which the two axes of the ellipse are equal ) . in linear polarization the electric field of the radio wave oscillates back and forth along one direction ; this can be affected by the mounting of the antenna but usually the desired direction is either horizontal or vertical polarization . in circular polarization , the electric field ( and magnetic field ) of the radio wave rotates at the radio frequency circularly around the axis of propagation . circular or elliptically polarized radio waves are designated as right-handed or left-handed using the " thumb in the direction of the propagation " rule . note that for circular polarization , optical researchers use the opposite right hand rule from the one used by radio engineers .
federalism refers to the mixed or compound mode of government , combining a general government ( the central or ' federal ' government ) with regional governments ( provincial , state , land , cantonal , territorial or other sub-unit governments ) in a single political system . its distinctive feature , exemplified in the founding example of modern federalism of the united states of america under the constitution of 1789 , is a relationship of parity between the two levels of government established . it can thus be defined as a form of government in which there is a division of powers between two levels of government of equal status .
the clergy was divided into two types : the secular clergy , who lived out in the world , and the regular clergy , who lived under a religious rule and were usually monks . throughout the period monks remained a very small proportion of the population , usually less than one per cent . most of the regular clergy were drawn from the nobility , the same social class that served as the recruiting ground for the upper levels of the secular clergy . the local parish priests were often drawn from the peasant class . townsmen were in a somewhat unusual position , as they did not fit into the traditional three-fold division of society into nobles , clergy , and peasants . during the 12th and 13th centuries , the ranks of the townsmen expanded greatly as existing towns grew and new population centres were founded . but throughout the middle ages the population of the towns probably never exceeded 10 per cent of the total population .
two of chopin 's long-standing pupils , karol mikuli ( 1821-1897 ) and georges mathias , were themselves piano teachers and passed on details of his playing to their own students , some of whom ( such as raoul koczalski ) were to make recordings of his music . other pianists and composers influenced by chopin 's style include louis moreau gottschalk , edouard wolff ( 1816-1880 ) and pierre zimmermann . debussy dedicated his own 1915 piano etudes to the memory of chopin ; he frequently played chopin 's music during his studies at the paris conservatoire , and undertook the editing of chopin 's piano music for the publisher jacques durand .
comic strips are generally short , multipanel comics that traditionally most commonly appeared in newspapers . in the us , daily strips have normally occupied a single tier , while sunday strips have been given multiple tiers . in the early 20th century , daily strips were typically in black-and-white and sundays were usually in colour and often occupied a full page .
one of the first recorded instances of translation in the west was the rendering of the old testament into greek in the 3rd century bce . the translation is known as the " septuagint , " a name that refers to the seventy translators ( seventy-two , in some versions ) who were commissioned to translate the bible at alexandria , egypt . each translator worked in solitary confinement in his own cell , and according to legend all seventy versions proved identical . the septuagint became the source text for later translations into many languages , including latin , coptic , armenian and georgian .
development of a solar-powered car has been an engineering goal since the 1980s . the world solar challenge is a biannual solar-powered car race , where teams from universities and enterprises compete over 3,021 kilometres ( 1,877 mi ) across central australia from darwin to adelaide . in 1987 , when it was founded , the winner 's average speed was 67 kilometres per hour ( 42 mph ) and by 2007 the winner 's average speed had improved to 90.87 kilometres per hour ( 56.46 mph ) . the north american solar challenge and the planned south african solar challenge are comparable competitions that reflect an international interest in the engineering and development of solar powered vehicles .
application of the term " indian " originated with christopher columbus , who , in his search for asia , thought that he had arrived in the east indies . the americas came to be known as the " west indies , " a name still used to refer to the islands of the caribbean sea . this led to the names " indies " and " indian , " which implied some kind of racial or cultural unity among the aboriginal peoples of the americas . this unifying concept , codified in law , religion , and politics , was not originally accepted by indigenous peoples but has been embraced by many over the last two centuries . [ citation needed ] even though the term " indian " does not include the aleuts , inuit , or yupik peoples , these groups are considered indigenous peoples of the americas .
the first known smelting of iron began in anatolia , around 1800 bc . called the bloomery process , it produced very soft but ductile wrought iron . by 800 bc , iron-making technology had spread to europe , arriving in japan around 700 ad . pig iron , a very hard but brittle alloy of iron and carbon , was being produced in china as early as 1200 bc , but did not arrive in europe until the middle ages . pig iron has a lower melting point than iron , and was used for making cast-iron . however , these metals found little practical use until the introduction of crucible steel around 300 bc . these steels were of poor quality , and the introduction of pattern welding , around the 1st century ad , sought to balance the extreme properties of the alloys by laminating them , to create a tougher metal . around 700 ad , the japanese began folding bloomery-steel and cast-iron in alternating layers to increase the strength of their swords , using clay fluxes to remove slag and impurities . this method of japanese swordsmithing produced one of the purest steel-alloys of the early middle ages .
anthropology is the study of humans and their societies in the past and present . its main subdivisions are social anthropology and cultural anthropology , which describes the workings of societies around the world , linguistic anthropology , which investigates the influence of language in social life , and biological or physical anthropology , which concerns long-term development of the human organism . archaeology , which studies past human cultures through investigation of physical evidence , is thought of as a branch of anthropology in the united states , while in europe , it is viewed as a discipline in its own right , or grouped under other related disciplines such as history .
later that summer , the russians invaded memel with 75,000 troops . memel had one of the strongest fortresses in prussia . however , after five days of artillery bombardment the russian army was able to storm it . the russians then used memel as a base to invade east prussia and defeated a smaller prussian force in the fiercely contested battle of gross-jagersdorf on 30 august 1757 . however , it was not yet able to take konigsberg and retreated soon afterward . still , it was a new threat to prussia . not only was frederick forced to break off his invasion of bohemia , he was now forced to withdraw further into prussian-controlled territory . his defeats on the battlefield brought still more opportunist nations into the war . sweden declared war on prussia and invaded pomerania with 17,000 men . sweden felt this small army was all that was needed to occupy pomerania and felt the swedish army would not need to engage with the prussians because the prussians were occupied on so many other fronts .
the rewritable audio cd is designed to be used in a consumer audio cd recorder , which will not ( without modification ) accept standard cd-rw discs . these consumer audio cd recorders use the serial copy management system ( scms ) , an early form of digital rights management ( drm ) , to conform to the united states ' audio home recording act ( ahra ) . the rewritable audio cd is typically somewhat more expensive than cd-rw due to ( a ) lower volume and ( b ) a 3 % ahra royalty used to compensate the music industry for the making of a copy .
on the other hand , many of the medieval buildings once situated within the town walls are now in ruins or have disappeared altogether . from successive incarnations of the motte and bailey castle , only a section of the bailey wall remains today , lying just off castle way . the last remains of the franciscan friary in southampton , founded circa 1233 and dissolved in 1538 , were swept away in the 1940s . the site is now occupied by friary house .
kerry said that he had intended the remark as a jab at president bush , and described the remarks as a " botched joke , " having inadvertently left out the key word " us " ( which would have been , " if you don 't , you get us stuck in iraq " ) , as well as leaving the phrase " just ask president bush " off of the end of the sentence . in kerry 's prepared remarks , which he released during the ensuing media frenzy , the corresponding line was ... " you end up getting us stuck in a war in iraq . just ask president bush . " he also said that from the context of the speech which , prior to the " stuck in iraq " line , made several specific references to bush and elements of his biography , that kerry was referring to president bush and not american troops in general .
women could not be professed to the dominican religious life before the age of thirteen . the formula for profession contained in the constitutions of montargis priory ( 1250 ) demands that nuns pledge obedience to god , the blessed virgin , their prioress and her successors according to the rule of st. augustine and the institute of the order , until death . the clothing of the sisters consisted of a white tunic and scapular , a leather belt , a black mantle , and a black veil . candidates to profession were tested to reveal whether they were actually married women who had merely separated from their husbands . their intellectual abilities were also tested . nuns were to be silent in places of prayer , the cloister , the dormitory , and refectory . silence was maintained unless the prioress granted an exception for a specific cause . speaking was allowed in the common parlor , but it was subordinate to strict rules , and the prioress , subprioress or other senior nun had to be present .
usb device communication is based on pipes ( logical channels ) . a pipe is a connection from the host controller to a logical entity , found on a device , and named an endpoint . because pipes correspond 1-to-1 to endpoints , the terms are sometimes used interchangeably . a usb device could have up to 32 endpoints ( 16 in , 16 out ) , though it 's rare to have so many . an endpoint is defined and numbered by the device during initialization ( the period after physical connection called " enumeration " ) and so is relatively permanent , whereas a pipe may be opened and closed .
environmental sustainability has become a mainstream issue , with profound effect on the architectural profession . many developers , those who support the financing of buildings , have become educated to encourage the facilitation of environmentally sustainable design , rather than solutions based primarily on immediate cost . major examples of this can be found in passive solar building design , greener roof designs , biodegradable materials , and more attention to a structure 's energy usage . this major shift in architecture has also changed architecture schools to focus more on the environment . sustainability in architecture was pioneered by frank lloyd wright , in the 1960s by buckminster fuller and in the 1970s by architects such as ian mcharg and sim van der ryn in the us and brenda and robert vale in the uk and new zealand . there has been an acceleration in the number of buildings which seek to meet green building sustainable design principles . sustainable practices that were at the core of vernacular architecture increasingly provide inspiration for environmentally and socially sustainable contemporary techniques . the u.s. green building council 's leed ( leadership in energy and environmental design ) rating system has been instrumental in this .

some bacteria produce intracellular nutrient storage granules for later use , such as glycogen , polyphosphate , sulfur or polyhydroxyalkanoates . certain bacterial species , such as the photosynthetic cyanobacteria , produce internal gas vesicles , which they use to regulate their buoyancy - allowing them to move up or down into water layers with different light intensities and nutrient levels . intracellular membranes called chromatophores are also found in membranes of phototrophic bacteria . used primarily for photosynthesis , they contain bacteriochlorophyll pigments and carotenoids . an early idea was that bacteria might contain membrane folds termed mesosomes , but these were later shown to be artifacts produced by the chemicals used to prepare the cells for electron microscopy . inclusions are considered to be nonliving components of the cell that do not possess metabolic activity and are not bounded by membranes . the most common inclusions are glycogen , lipid droplets , crystals , and pigments . volutin granules are cytoplasmic inclusions of complexed inorganic polyphosphate . these granules are called metachromatic granules due to their displaying the metachromatic effect ; they appear red or blue when stained with the blue dyes methylene blue or toluidine blue . gas vacuoles , which are freely permeable to gas , are membrane-bound vesicles present in some species of cyanobacteria . they allow the bacteria to control their buoyancy . microcompartments are widespread , membrane-bound organelles that are made of a protein shell that surrounds and encloses various enzymes . carboxysomes are bacterial microcompartments that contain enzymes involved in carbon fixation . magnetosomes are bacterial microcompartments , present in magnetotactic bacteria , that contain magnetic crystals .

in the age of reason philosophical tracts and speculations on history and human nature integrated literature with social and political developments . the inevitable reaction was the explosion of romanticism in the later 18th century which reclaimed the imaginative and fantastical bias of old romances and folk-literature and asserted the primacy of individual experience and emotion . but as the 19th-century went on , european fiction evolved towards realism and naturalism , the meticulous documentation of real life and social trends . much of the output of naturalism was implicitly polemical , and influenced social and political change , but 20th century fiction and drama moved back towards the subjective , emphasising unconscious motivations and social and environmental pressures on the individual . writers such as proust , eliot , joyce , kafka and pirandello exemplify the trend of documenting internal rather than external realities .
they formed , and identified with various religious groups advocating greater purity of worship and doctrine , as well as personal and group piety . puritans adopted a reformed theology , but they also took note of radical criticisms of zwingli in zurich and calvin in geneva . in church polity , some advocated for separation from all other christians , in favor of autonomous gathered churches . these separatist and independent strands of puritanism became prominent in the 1640s , when the supporters of a presbyterian polity in the westminster assembly were unable to forge a new english national church .
in the early 1980s , chicago radio jocks the hot mix 5 , and club djs ron hardy and frankie knuckles played various styles of dance music , including older disco records ( mostly philly disco and salsoul tracks ) , electro funk tracks by artists such as afrika bambaataa , newer italo disco , b-boy hip hop music by man parrish , jellybean benitez , arthur baker , and john robie , and electronic pop music by kraftwerk and yellow magic orchestra . some made and played their own edits of their favorite songs on reel-to-reel tape , and sometimes mixed in effects , drum machines , and other rhythmic electronic instrumentation . in this era ,
brahmi evolved into a multiplicity of brahmic scripts , many of which were used to write sanskrit . roughly contemporary with the brahmi , kharosthi was used in the northwest of the subcontinent . sometime between the fourth and eighth centuries , the gupta script , derived from brahmi , became prevalent . around the eighth century , the sarada script evolved out of the gupta script . the latter was displaced in its turn by devanagari in the 11th or 12th century , with intermediary stages such as the siddham script . in east india , the bengali alphabet , and , later , the odia alphabet , were used .
houston was founded in 1836 on land near the banks of buffalo bayou ( now known as allen 's landing ) and incorporated as a city on june 5 , 1837 . the city was named after former general sam houston , who was president of the republic of texas and had commanded and won at the battle of san jacinto 25 miles ( 40 km ) east of where the city was established . the burgeoning port and railroad industry , combined with oil discovery in 1901 , has induced continual surges in the city 's population . in the mid-twentieth century , houston became the home of the texas medical center - the world 's largest concentration of healthcare and research institutions - and nasa 's johnson space center , where the mission control center is located .

the figure of the " tragic octoroon " was a stock character of abolitionist literature : a mixed-race woman raised as if a white woman in her white father 's household , until his bankruptcy or death has her reduced to a menial position she may even be unaware of her status before being reduced to victimization . the first character of this type was the heroine of lydia maria child 's " the quadroons " ( 1842 ) , a short story . this character allowed abolitionists to draw attention to the sexual exploitation in slavery and , unlike portrayals of the suffering of the field hands , did not allow slaveholders to retort that the sufferings of northern mill hands were no easier . the northern mill owner would not sell his own children into slavery .
meanwhile , in renaissance italy , a new period in the history of translation had opened in florence with the arrival , at the court of cosimo de ' medici , of the byzantine scholar georgius gemistus pletho shortly before the fall of constantinople to the turks ( 1453 ) . a latin translation of plato 's works was undertaken by marsilio ficino . this and erasmus ' latin edition of the new testament led to a new attitude to translation . for the first time , readers demanded rigor of rendering , as philosophical and religious beliefs depended on the exact words of plato , aristotle and jesus .
matsushita provided a cash infusion , but the clash of cultures was too great to overcome , and five years later matsushita sold an 80 % stake in mca / universal to canadian drinks distributor seagram for $ 5.7 billion . seagram sold off its stake in dupont to fund this expansion into the entertainment industry . hoping to build an entertainment empire around universal , seagram bought polygram in 1999 and other entertainment properties , but the fluctuating profits characteristic of hollywood were no substitute for the reliable income stream gained from the previously held shares in dupont .

insects are the only group of invertebrates to have developed flight . the evolution of insect wings has been a subject of debate . some entomologists suggest that the wings are from paranotal lobes , or extensions from the insect 's exoskeleton called the nota , called the paranotal theory . other theories are based on a pleural origin . these theories include suggestions that wings originated from modified gills , spiracular flaps or as from an appendage of the epicoxa . the epicoxal theory suggests the insect wings are modified epicoxal exites , a modified appendage at the base of the legs or coxa . in the carboniferous age , some of the meganeura dragonflies had as much as a 50 cm ( 20 in ) wide wingspan . the appearance of gigantic insects has been found to be consistent with high atmospheric oxygen . the respiratory system of insects constrains their size , however the high oxygen in the atmosphere allowed larger sizes . the largest flying insects today are much smaller and include several moth species such as the atlas moth and the white witch ( thysania agrippina ) .
the duke of york had required that every community in his new lands of new york and new jersey support some church , but this was more often dutch reformed , quaker or presbyterian , than anglican . some chose to support more than one church . he also ordained that the tax-payers were free , having paid his local tax , to choose their own church . the terms for the surrender of new amsterdam had provided that the dutch would have liberty of conscience , and the duke , as an openly divine-right catholic , was no friend of anglicanism . the first anglican minister in new jersey arrived in 1698 , though anglicanism was more popular in new york .
seattle in this period attracted widespread attention as home to these many companies , but also by hosting the 1990 goodwill games and the apec leaders conference in 1993 , as well as through the worldwide popularity of grunge , a sound that had developed in seattle 's independent music scene . another bid for worldwide attention - hosting the world trade organization ministerial conference of 1999 - garnered visibility , but not in the way its sponsors desired , as related protest activity and police reactions to those protests overshadowed the conference itself . the city was further shaken by the mardi gras riots in 2001 , and then literally shaken the following day by the nisqually earthquake .
the diwan of umar , assigning annuities to all arabs and to the muslim soldiers of other races , underwent a change in the hands of the umayyads . the umayyads meddled with the register and the recipients regarded pensions as the subsistence allowance even without being in active service . hisham reformed it and paid only to those who participated in battle . on the pattern of the byzantine system the umayyads reformed their army organization in general and divided it into five corps : the centre , two wings , vanguards and rearguards , following the same formation while on march or on a battle field . marwan ii ( 740-50 ) abandoned the old division and introduced kurdus ( cohort ) , a small compact body . the umayyad troops were divided into three divisions : infantry , cavalry and artillery . arab troops were dressed and armed in greek fashion . the umayyad cavalry used plain and round saddles . the artillery used arradah ( ballista ) , manjaniq ( the mangonel ) and dabbabah or kabsh ( the battering ram ) . the heavy engines , siege machines and baggage were carried on camels behind the army .

the rev. theodore hesburgh , c.s.c. , ( 1917-2015 ) served as president for 35 years ( 1952-87 ) of dramatic transformations . in that time the annual operating budget rose by a factor of 18 from $ 9.7 million to $ 176.6 million , and the endowment by a factor of 40 from $ 9 million to $ 350 million , and research funding by a factor of 20 from $ 735,000 to $ 15 million . enrollment nearly doubled from 4,979 to 9,600 , faculty more than doubled 389 to 950 , and degrees awarded annually doubled from 1,212 to 2,500 .
most fatty acids are non-essential , meaning the body can produce them as needed , generally from other fatty acids and always by expending energy to do so . however , in humans , at least two fatty acids are essential and must be included in the diet . an appropriate balance of essential fatty acids - omega-3 and omega-6 fatty acids - seems also important for health , although definitive experimental demonstration has been elusive . both of these " omega " long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acids are substrates for a class of eicosanoids known as prostaglandins , which have roles throughout the human body . they are hormones , in some respects . the omega-3 eicosapentaenoic acid ( epa ) , which can be made in the human body from the omega-3 essential fatty acid alpha-linolenic acid ( ala ) , or taken in through marine food sources , serves as a building block for series 3 prostaglandins ( e.g. , weakly inflammatory pge3 ) . the omega-6 dihomo-gamma-linolenic acid ( dgla ) serves as a building block for series 1 prostaglandins ( e.g. anti-inflammatory pge1 ) , whereas arachidonic acid ( aa ) serves as a building block for series 2 prostaglandins ( e.g. pro-inflammatory pge 2 ) . both dgla and aa can be made from the omega-6 linoleic acid ( la ) in the human body , or can be taken in directly through food . an appropriately balanced intake of omega-3 and omega-6 partly determines the relative production of different prostaglandins , which is one reason why a balance between omega-3 and omega-6 is believed important for cardiovascular health . in industrialized societies , people typically consume large amounts of processed vegetable oils , which have reduced amounts of the essential fatty acids along with too much of omega-6 fatty acids relative to omega-3 fatty acids .

many portuguese holidays , festivals and traditions have a christian origin or connotation . although relations between the portuguese state and the roman catholic church were generally amiable and stable since the earliest years of the portuguese nation , their relative power fluctuated . in the 13th and 14th centuries , the church enjoyed both riches and power stemming from its role in the reconquest , its close identification with early portuguese nationalism and the foundation of the portuguese educational system , including the first university . the growth of the portuguese overseas empire made its missionaries important agents of colonization , with important roles in the education and evangelization of people from all the inhabited continents . the growth of liberal and nascent republican movements during the eras leading to the formation of the first portuguese republic ( 1910-26 ) changed the role and importance of organized religion .
while each wrestling match is ostensibly a competition of athletics and strategy , the goal of each match from a business standpoint is to excite and entertain the audience . although the competition is staged , dramatic emphasis can be utilized to draw out the most intense reaction from the audience . heightened interest results in higher attendance rates , increased ticket sales , higher ratings on television broadcasts ( which result in greater ad revenue ) , higher pay-per-view buyrates , and sales of branded merchandise and recorded video footage . all of these contribute to the profit of the promotion company .
following al-farabi 's lead , avicenna initiated a full-fledged inquiry into the question of being , in which he distinguished between essence ( mahiat ) and existence ( wujud ) . he argued that the fact of existence can not be inferred from or accounted for by the essence of existing things , and that form and matter by themselves cannot interact and originate the movement of the universe or the progressive actualization of existing things . existence must , therefore , be due to an agent-cause that necessitates , imparts , gives , or adds existence to an essence . to do so , the cause must be an existing thing and coexist with its effect .

in terms of impact on events , it was more than napoleon 's personality that took effect . he reorganized france itself to supply the men and money needed for great wars . above all he inspired his men - wellington said his presence on the battlefield was worth 40,000 soldiers , for he inspired confidence from privates to field marshals . he also unnerved the enemy . at the battle of auerstadt in 1806 , king frederick william iii of prussia outnumbered the french by 63,000 to 27,000 ; however , when he mistakenly was told that napoleon was in command , he ordered a hasty retreat that turned into a rout . the force of his personality neutralized material difficulties as his soldiers fought with the confidence that with napoleon in charge they would surely win .
during the 1950s the rivalry was exacerbated further when there was a controversy surrounding the transfer of alfredo di stefano , who finally played for real madrid and was key to their subsequent success . the 1960s saw the rivalry reach the european stage when they met twice in a controversial knock-out round of the european cup , with madrid receiving unfavourable treatment from the referee . in 2002 , the european encounter between the clubs was dubbed the " match of the century " by spanish media , and madrid 's win was watched by more than 500 million people .
montana schoolchildren played a significant role in selecting several state symbols . the state tree , the ponderosa pine , was selected by montana schoolchildren as the preferred state tree by an overwhelming majority in a referendum held in 1908 . however , the legislature did not designate a state tree until 1949 , when the montana federation of garden clubs , with the support of the state forester , lobbied for formal recognition . schoolchildren also chose the western meadowlark as the state bird , in a 1930 vote , and the legislature acted to endorse this decision in 1931 . similarly , the secretary of state sponsored a children 's vote in 1981 to choose a state animal , and after 74 animals were nominated , the grizzly bear won over the elk by a 2-1 margin . the students of livingston started a statewide school petition drive plus lobbied the governor and the state legislature to name the maiasaura as the state fossil in 1985 .

child labour has been a consistent struggle for children in brazil ever since the country was colonized on april 22 , 1550 by pedro alvares cabral . work that many children took part in was not always visible , legal , or paid . free or slave labour was a common occurrence for many youths and was a part of their everyday lives as they grew into adulthood . yet due to there being no clear definition of how to classify what a child or youth is , there has been little historical documentation of child labour during the colonial period . due to this lack of documentation , it is hard to determine just how many children were used for what kinds of work before the nineteenth century . the first documentation of child labour in brazil occurred during the time of indigenous societies and slave labour where it was found that children were forcibly working on tasks that exceeded their emotional and physical limits . armando dias , for example , died in november 1913 whilst still very young , a victim of an electric shock when entering the textile industry where he worked . boys and girls were victims of industrial accidents on a daily basis .
throughout most of his career , athanasius had many detractors . classical scholar timothy barnes relates contemporary allegations against athanasius : from defiling an altar , to selling church grain that had been meant to feed the poor for his own personal gain , and even violence and murder to suppress dissent . athanasius used " arian " to describe both followers of arius , and as a derogatory polemical term for christians who disagreed with his formulation of the trinity . athanasius called many of his opponents " arian , " except for miletus .

in 1947 , the king and his family toured southern africa . the prime minister of the union of south africa , jan smuts , was facing an election and hoped to make political capital out of the visit . george was appalled , however , when instructed by the south african government to shake hands only with whites , and referred to his south african bodyguards as " the gestapo . " despite the tour , smuts lost the election the following year , and the new government instituted a strict policy of racial segregation .
historian h. paul varley notes the description of japan given by jesuit leader st. francis xavier ( 1506-1552 ) : " there is no nation in the world which fears death less . " xavier further describes the honour and manners of the people : " i fancy that there are no people in the world more punctilious about their honour than the japanese , for they will not put up with a single insult or even a word spoken in anger . " xavier spent the years 1549-1551 converting japanese to christianity . he also observed : " the japanese are much braver and more warlike than the people of china , korea , ternate and all of the other nations around the philippines . "
protestants reject the roman catholic church 's doctrine that it is the one true church , believing in the invisible church , which consists of all who profess faith in jesus christ . some protestant denominations are less accepting of other denominations , and the basic orthodoxy of some is questioned by most of the others . individual denominations also have formed over very subtle theological differences . other denominations are simply regional or ethnic expressions of the same beliefs . because the five solas are the main tenets of the protestant faith , non-denominational groups and organizations are also considered protestant .
somali scholars have for centuries produced many notable examples of islamic literature ranging from poetry to hadith . with the adoption of the latin alphabet in 1972 to transcribe the somali language , numerous contemporary somali authors have also released novels , some of which have gone on to receive worldwide acclaim . of these modern writers , nuruddin farah is probably the most celebrated . books such as from a crooked rib and links are considered important literary achievements , works which have earned farah , among other accolades , the 1998 neustadt international prize for literature . farah mohamed jama awl is another prominent somali writer who is perhaps best known for his dervish era novel , ignorance is the enemy of love . young upstart nadifa mohamed was also awarded the 2010 betty trask prize . additionally , mohamed ibrahim warsame ' hadrawi ' is considered by many to be the greatest living somali poet , and several of his works have been translated internationally .
during the cambrian period , gondwana had a mild climate . west antarctica was partially in the northern hemisphere , and during this period large amounts of sandstones , limestones and shales were deposited . east antarctica was at the equator , where sea floor invertebrates and trilobites flourished in the tropical seas . by the start of the devonian period ( 416 ma ) , gondwana was in more southern latitudes and the climate was cooler , though fossils of land plants are known from this time . sand and silts were laid down in what is now the ellsworth , horlick and pensacola mountains . glaciation began at the end of the devonian period ( 360 ma ) , as gondwana became centered on the south pole and the climate cooled , though flora remained . during the permian period , the land became dominated by seed plants such as glossopteris , a pteridosperm which grew in swamps . over time these swamps became deposits of coal in the transantarctic mountains . towards the end of the permian period , continued warming led to a dry , hot climate over much of gondwana .
hunting is primarily regulated by state law ; additional regulations are imposed through united states environmental law in the case of migratory birds and endangered species . regulations vary widely from state to state and govern the areas , time periods , techniques and methods by which specific game animals may be hunted . some states make a distinction between protected species and unprotected species ( often vermin or varmints for which there are no hunting regulations ) . hunters of protected species require a hunting license in all states , for which completion of a hunting safety course is sometimes a prerequisite .
adult contemporary traces its roots to the 1960s easy listening format , which adopted a 70-80 % instrumental - 20-30 % vocal mix . a few offered 90 % instrumentals , and a handful were entirely instrumental . the easy listening format , as it was first known , was born of a desire by some radio stations in the late 1950s and early 1960s to continue playing current hit songs but distinguish themselves from being branded as " rock and roll " stations . billboard first published the easy listening chart july 17 , 1961 , with 20 songs ; the first number one was " boll weevil song " by brook benton . the chart described itself as " not too far out in either direction . "
the most widely used class of antenna , a dipole antenna consists of two symmetrical radiators such as metal rods or wires , with one side of the balanced feedline from the transmitter or receiver attached to each . a horizontal dipole radiates in two lobes perpendicular to the antenna 's axis . a half-wave dipole the most common type , has two collinear elements each a quarter wavelength long and a gain of 2.15 dbi . used individually as low gain antennas , dipoles are also used as driven elements in many more complicated higher gain types of antennas .
the most influential publication of the enlightenment was the encyclopedie , compiled by denis diderot and ( until 1759 ) by jean le rond d 'alembert and a team of 150 scientists and philosophers . it was published between 1751 and 1772 in thirty-five volumes , and spread the ideas of the enlightenment across europe and beyond . other landmark publications were the dictionnaire philosophique ( philosophical dictionary , 1764 ) and letters on the english ( 1733 ) written by voltaire ; rousseau 's discourse on inequality ( 1754 ) and the social contract ( 1762 ) ; and montesquieu 's spirit of the laws ( 1748 ) . the ideas of the enlightenment played a major role in inspiring the french revolution , which began in 1789 . after the revolution , the enlightenment was followed by an opposing intellectual movement known as romanticism .
modern archaeology has led to the discovery of han artwork portraying inventions which were otherwise absent in han literary sources . as observed in han miniature tomb models , but not in literary sources , the crank handle was used to operate the fans of winnowing machines that separated grain from chaff . the odometer cart , invented during han , measured journey lengths , using mechanical figures banging drums and gongs to indicate each distance traveled . this invention is depicted in han artwork by the 2nd century ad , yet detailed written descriptions were not offered until the 3rd century ad . modern archaeologists have also unearthed specimens of devices used during the han dynasty , for example a pair of sliding metal calipers used by craftsmen for making minute measurements . these calipers contain inscriptions of the exact day and year they were manufactured . these tools are not mentioned in any han literary sources .
the languages have not undergone the deliberate highlighting of minor linguistic differences in the name of nationalism as has occurred in the bosnian , serbian and croatian standards of serbo-croatian . however , most slavic languages ( including czech ) have been distanced in this way from russian influences because of widespread public resentment against the former soviet union ( which occupied czechoslovakia in 1968 ) . czech and slovak form a dialect continuum , with great similarity between neighboring czech and slovak dialects . ( see " dialects " below . )
the tram system that now criss-crosses the historic city centre complements walking and biking in it . the centre has been transformed into a pedestrian priority zone that enables and invites walking and biking by making these active modes of transport comfortable , safe and enjoyable . these attributes are accomplished by applying the principle of " filtered permeability " to the existing irregular network of streets . it means that the network adaptations favour active transportation and , selectively , " filter out " the car by reducing the number of streets that run through the centre . while certain streets are discontinuous for cars , they connect to a network of pedestrian and bike paths which permeate the entire centre . in addition , these paths go through public squares and open spaces increasing the enjoyment of the trip . this logic of filtering a mode of transport is fully expressed in a comprehensive model for laying out neighbourhoods and districts - the fused grid .
the capital city of windhoek plays a very important role in namibia 's tourism due to its central location and close proximity to hosea kutako international airport . according to the namibia tourism exit survey , which was produced by the millennium challenge corporation for the namibian directorate of tourism , 56 % of all tourists visiting namibia during the time period , 2012 - 2013 , visited windhoek . many of namibia 's tourism related parastatals and governing bodies such as namibia wildlife resorts , air namibia and the namibia tourism board as well as namibia 's tourism related trade associations such as the hospitality association of namibia are also all headquartered in windhoek . there are also a number of notable hotels in windhoek such as windhoek country club resort and some international hotel chains also operate in windhoek , such as avani hotels and resorts and hilton hotels and resorts .
area air defence , the air defence of a specific area or location , ( as opposed to point defence ) , have historically been operated by both armies ( anti-aircraft command in the british army , for instance ) and air forces ( the united states air force 's cim-10 bomarc ) . area defence systems have medium to long range and can be made up of various other systems and networked into an area defence system ( in which case it may be made up of several short range systems combined to effectively cover an area ) . an example of area defence is the defence of saudi arabia and israel by mim-104 patriot missile batteries during the first gulf war , where the objective was to cover populated areas .
the warnerke standard sensitometer consisted of a frame holding an opaque screen with an array of typically 25 numbered , gradually pigmented squares brought into contact with the photographic plate during a timed test exposure under a phosphorescent tablet excited before by the light of a burning magnesium ribbon . the speed of the emulsion was then expressed in ' degrees ' warnerke ( sometimes seen as warn. or ° w. ) corresponding with the last number visible on the exposed plate after development and fixation . each number represented an increase of 1 / 3 in speed , typical plate speeds were between 10 ° and 25 ° warnerke at the time .
from 1792 , when the mint act was passed , the dollar was defined as 371.25 grains ( 24.056 g ) of silver . many historians [ who ? ] erroneously assume gold was standardized at a fixed rate in parity with silver ; however , there is no evidence of congress making this law . this has to do with alexander hamilton 's suggestion to congress of a fixed 15 : 1 ratio of silver to gold , respectively . the gold coins that were minted however , were not given any denomination whatsoever and traded for a market value relative to the congressional standard of the silver dollar . 1834 saw a shift in the gold standard to 23.2 grains ( 1.50 g ) , followed by a slight adjustment to 23.22 grains ( 1.505 g ) in 1837 ( 16 : 1 ratio ) .

in the early heian period , the late 8th and early 9th centuries , emperor kammu sought to consolidate and expand his rule in northern honshu , but the armies he sent to conquer the rebellious emishi people lacked motivation and discipline , and failed in their task . [ citation needed ] emperor kammu introduced the title of sei 'i-taishogun ( 征夷大将軍 ) or shogun , and began to rely on the powerful regional clans to conquer the emishi . skilled in mounted combat and archery ( kyudo ) , these clan warriors became the emperor 's preferred tool for putting down rebellions . [ citation needed ] though this is the first known use of the " shogun " title , it was a temporary title , and was not imbued with political power until the 13th century . at this time ( the 7th to 9th century ) the imperial court officials considered them merely a military section under the control of the imperial court .
modern separation techniques such as milling , centrifugation , and pressing have enabled concentration of particular components of food , yielding flour , oils , juices , and so on , and even separate fatty acids , amino acids , vitamins , and minerals . inevitably , such large-scale concentration changes the nutritional content of food , saving certain nutrients while removing others . heating techniques may also reduce food 's content of many heat-labile nutrients such as certain vitamins and phytochemicals , and possibly other yet-to-be-discovered substances . because of reduced nutritional value , processed foods are often ' enriched ' or ' fortified ' with some of the most critical nutrients ( usually certain vitamins ) that were lost during processing . nonetheless , processed foods tend to have an inferior nutritional profile compared to whole , fresh foods , regarding content of both sugar and high gi starches , potassium / sodium , vitamins , fiber , and of intact , unoxidized ( essential ) fatty acids . in addition , processed foods often contain potentially harmful substances such as oxidized fats and trans fatty acids .
this influx was compounded by the decline of the western sudanic mali empire in 1375 and the songhai empire in 1591 . additionally , as inland regions underwent desertification , inhabitants moved to the wetter coast . these new inhabitants brought skills such as cotton spinning , cloth weaving , iron smelting , rice and sorghum cultivation , and social and political institutions from the mali and songhai empires . shortly after the mane conquered the region , the vai people of the former mali empire immigrated into the grand cape mount region . the ethnic kru opposed the influx of vai , forming an alliance with the mane to stop further influx of vai .

the original city council line-up of 14 members ( nine district-based and five at-large positions ) was based on a u.s. justice department mandate which took effect in 1979 . at-large council members represent the entire city . under the city charter , once the population in the city limits exceeded 2.1 million residents , two additional districts were to be added . the city of houston 's official 2010 census count was 600 shy of the required number ; however , as the city was expected to grow beyond 2.1 million shortly thereafter , the two additional districts were added for , and the positions filled during , the august 2011 elections .
for over 200 years , russia had been expanding southwards across the sparsely populated " wild fields " toward the warm water ports of the black sea that did not freeze over like the handful of other ports available in the north . the goal was to promote year-round trade and a year-round navy . : 11 pursuit of this goal brought the emerging russian state into conflict with the ukrainian cossacks and then with the tatars of the crimean khanate and circassians . when russia conquered these groups and gained possession of southern ukraine , known as new russia during russian imperial times , the ottoman empire lost its buffer zone against russian expansion , and russia and the ottoman empire fell into direct conflict . the conflict with the ottoman empire also presented a religious issue of importance , as russia saw itself as the protector of orthodox christians , many of whom lived under ottoman control and were treated as second-class citizens . ( ch 1 )
modern standard italian itself is heavily based on the latin-derived florentine tuscan language . the tuscan-based language that would eventually become modern standard italian had been used in poetry and literature since at least the 12th century , and it first became widely known in italy through the works of authors such as dante alighieri , giovanni boccaccio , niccolo machiavelli , and petrarch . dante 's florentine-tuscan literary italian thus became the language of the literate and upper class in italy , and it spread throughout the peninsula as the lingua franca among the italian educated class as well as italian traveling merchants . the economic prowess and cultural and artistic importance of tuscany in the late middle ages and the renaissance further encouraged the diffusion of the florentine-tuscan italian throughout italy and among the educated and powerful , though local and regional languages remained the main languages of the common people .
mathematics : the earliest traces of mathematical knowledge in the indian subcontinent appear with the indus valley civilization ( c . 4th millennium bc ~ c . 3rd millennium bc ) . the people of this civilization made bricks whose dimensions were in the proportion 4 : 2 : 1 , considered favorable for the stability of a brick structure . they also tried to standardize measurement of length to a high degree of accuracy . they designed a ruler - the mohenjo-daro ruler - whose unit of length ( approximately 1.32 inches or 3.4 centimetres ) was divided into ten equal parts . bricks manufactured in ancient mohenjo-daro often had dimensions that were integral multiples of this unit of length .
both the number of base pairs and the number of genes vary widely from one species to another , and there is only a rough correlation between the two ( an observation known as the c-value paradox ) . at present , the highest known number of genes is around 60,000 , for the protozoan causing trichomoniasis ( see list of sequenced eukaryotic genomes ) , almost three times as many as in the human genome .
incandescent light bulbs consist of an air-tight glass enclosure ( the envelope , or bulb ) with a filament of tungsten wire inside the bulb , through which an electric current is passed . contact wires and a base with two ( or more ) conductors provide electrical connections to the filament . incandescent light bulbs usually contain a stem or glass mount anchored to the bulb 's base that allows the electrical contacts to run through the envelope without air or gas leaks . small wires embedded in the stem in turn support the filament and its lead wires .
the coastal plain transitions to the piedmont region along the atlantic seaboard fall line , a line which marks the elevation at which waterfalls first appear on streams and rivers . the piedmont region of central north carolina is the state 's most urbanized and densely populated section . it consists of gently rolling countryside frequently broken by hills or low mountain ridges . small , isolated , and deeply eroded mountain ranges and peaks are located in the piedmont , including the sauratown mountains , pilot mountain , the uwharrie mountains , crowder 's mountain , king 's pinnacle , the brushy mountains , and the south mountains . the piedmont ranges from about 300 to 400 feet ( 91 to 122 m ) in elevation in the east to over 1,000 feet ( 300 m ) in the west . because of the rapid population growth in the piedmont , a significant part of the rural area in this region is being transformed into suburbs with shopping centers , housing , and corporate offices . agriculture is steadily declining in importance . the major rivers of the piedmont , such as the yadkin and catawba , tend to be fast-flowing , shallow , and narrow .
one of the more prominent contestants this year was chris medina , whose story of caring for his brain-damaged fiancee received widespread coverage . medina was cut in the top 40 round . casey abrams , who suffers from ulcerative colitis , was hospitalized twice and missed the top 13 result show . the judges used their one save on abrams on the top 11 , and as a result this was the first season that 11 finalists went on tour instead of 10 . in the following week , naima adedapo and thia megia were both eliminated the following week .
with the arrival of francisco vazquez de coronado , a spanish conquistador , the first recorded history of encounter between europeans and native americans in the great plains occurred in texas , kansas and nebraska from 1540-1542 . in that same time period , hernando de soto crossed a west-northwest direction in what is now oklahoma and texas . today this is known as the de soto trail . the spanish thought the great plains were the location of the mythological quivira and cibola , a place said to be rich in gold .

this still left open the question of whether the opposite of approach in the prefrontal cortex is better described as moving away ( direction model ) , as unmoving but with strength and resistance ( movement model ) , or as unmoving with passive yielding ( action tendency model ) . support for the action tendency model ( passivity related to right prefrontal activity ) comes from research on shyness and research on behavioral inhibition . research that tested the competing hypotheses generated by all four models also supported the action tendency model .
the presence of the university of california , san diego and other research institutions has helped to fuel biotechnology growth . in 2013 , san diego has the second-largest biotech cluster in the united states , below the boston area and above the san francisco bay area . there are more than 400 biotechnology companies in the area . in particular , the la jolla and nearby sorrento valley areas are home to offices and research facilities for numerous biotechnology companies . major biotechnology companies like illumina and neurocrine biosciences are headquartered in san diego , while many biotech and pharmaceutical companies have offices or research facilities in san diego . san diego is also home to more than 140 contract research organizations ( cros ) that provide a variety of contract services for pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies .
botany , also called plant science ( s ) or plant biology , is the science of plant life and a branch of biology . a botanist or plant scientist is a scientist who specializes in this field . the term " botany " comes from the ancient greek word βοτανη ( botane ) meaning " pasture , " " grass , " or " fodder " ; βοτανη is in turn derived from βοσκειν ( boskein ) , " to feed " or " to graze . " traditionally , botany has also included the study of fungi and algae by mycologists and phycologists respectively , with the study of these three groups of organisms remaining within the sphere of interest of the international botanical congress . nowadays , botanists study approximately 400,000 species of living organisms of which some 260,000 species are vascular plants and about 248,000 are flowering plants .
with over 90 million inhabitants , egypt is the most populous country in north africa and the arab world , the third-most populous in africa ( after nigeria and ethiopia ) , and the fifteenth-most populous in the world . the great majority of its people live near the banks of the nile river , an area of about 40,000 square kilometres ( 15,000 sq mi ) , where the only arable land is found . the large regions of the sahara desert , which constitute most of egypt 's territory , are sparsely inhabited . about half of egypt 's residents live in urban areas , with most spread across the densely populated centres of greater cairo , alexandria and other major cities in the nile delta .
in the late 12th and early 13th centuries the border and political relationship between england and scotland was disputed , with the kings of scotland claiming parts of what is now northern england . john 's father , henry ii , had forced william the lion to swear fealty to him at the treaty of falaise in 1174 . this had been rescinded by richard i in exchange for financial compensation in 1189 , but the relationship remained uneasy . john began his reign by reasserting his sovereignty over the disputed northern counties . he refused william 's request for the earldom of northumbria , but did not intervene in scotland itself and focused on his continental problems . the two kings maintained a friendly relationship , meeting in 1206 and 1207 , until it was rumoured in 1209 that william was intending to ally himself with philip ii of france . john invaded scotland and forced william to sign the treaty of norham , which gave john control of william 's daughters and required a payment of £ 10,000 . this effectively crippled william 's power north of the border , and by 1212 john had to intervene militarily to support the scottish king against his internal rivals . [ nb 16 ] john made no efforts to reinvigorate the treaty of falaise , though , and both william and alexander remained independent kings , supported by , but not owing fealty to , john .

" with the phrase " we authors , ma 'am , " he complimented her . disraeli 's ministry only lasted a matter of months , and at the end of the year his liberal rival , william ewart gladstone , was appointed prime minister . victoria found gladstone 's demeanour far less appealing ; he spoke to her , she is thought to have complained , as though she were " a public meeting rather than a woman . "
schwarzenegger 's goal was to become the greatest bodybuilder in the world , which meant becoming mr. olympia . his first attempt was in 1969 , when he lost to three-time champion sergio oliva . however , schwarzenegger came back in 1970 and won the competition , making him the youngest ever mr. olympia at the age of 23 , a record he still holds to this day .
since all contact between the wrestlers must cease if any part of the body is touching , or underneath , the ropes , many wrestlers will attempt to break submission holds by deliberately grabbing the bottom ropes . this is called a " rope break , " and it is one of the most common ways to break a submission hold . most holds leave an arm or leg free , so that the person can tap out if they want . instead , they use these free limbs to either grab one of the ring ropes ( the bottom one is the most common , as it is nearest the wrestlers , though other ropes sometimes are used for standing holds such as chris masters ' master lock ) or drape their foot across , or underneath one . once this has been accomplished , and the accomplishment is witnessed by the referee , the referee will demand that the offending wrestler break the hold , and start counting to five if the wrestler does not . if the referee reaches the count of five , and the wrestler still does not break the hold , they are disqualified .
other cities with a concentration of secular gothic include bruges and siena . most surviving small secular buildings are relatively plain and straightforward ; most windows are flat-topped with mullions , with pointed arches and vaulted ceilings often only found at a few focal points . the country-houses of the nobility were slow to abandon the appearance of being a castle , even in parts of europe , like england , where defence had ceased to be a real concern . the living and working parts of many monastic buildings survive , for example at mont saint-michel .
gaddafi 's earliest education was of a religious nature , imparted by a local islamic teacher . subsequently moving to nearby sirte to attend elementary school , he progressed through six grades in four years . education in libya was not free , but his father thought it would greatly benefit his son despite the financial strain . during the week gaddafi slept in a mosque , and at weekends walked 20 miles to visit his parents . bullied for being a bedouin , he was proud of his identity and encouraged pride in other bedouin children . from sirte , he and his family moved to the market town of sabha in fezzan , south-central libya , where his father worked as a caretaker for a tribal leader while muammar attended secondary school , something neither parent had done . gaddafi was popular at school ; some friends made there received significant jobs in his later administration , most notably his best friend abdul salam jalloud .
by 1860 , houston had emerged as a commercial and railroad hub for the export of cotton . railroad spurs from the texas inland converged in houston , where they met rail lines to the ports of galveston and beaumont . during the american civil war , houston served as a headquarters for general john bankhead magruder , who used the city as an organization point for the battle of galveston . after the civil war , houston businessmen initiated efforts to widen the city 's extensive system of bayous so the city could accept more commerce between downtown and the nearby port of galveston . by 1890 , houston was the railroad center of texas .
several subsets of unicode are standardized : microsoft windows since windows nt 4.0 supports wgl-4 with 652 characters , which is considered to support all contemporary european languages using the latin , greek , or cyrillic script . other standardized subsets of unicode include the multilingual european subsets : mes-1 ( latin scripts only , 335 characters ) , mes-2 ( latin , greek and cyrillic 1062 characters ) and mes-3a & mes-3b ( two larger subsets , not shown here ) . note that mes-2 includes every character in mes-1 and wgl-4 .
criminal justice agencies in england and wales use at least two separate racial / ethnic classification systems when reporting crime , as of 2010 . one is the system used in the 2001 census when individuals identify themselves as belonging to a particular ethnic group : w1 ( white-british ) , w2 ( white-irish ) , w9 ( any other white background ) ; m1 ( white and black caribbean ) , m2 ( white and black african ) , m3 ( white and asian ) , m9 ( any other mixed background ) ; a1 ( asian-indian ) , a2 ( asian-pakistani ) , a3 ( asian-bangladeshi ) , a9 ( any other asian background ) ; b1 ( black caribbean ) , b2 ( black african ) , b3 ( any other black background ) ; o1 ( chinese ) , o9 ( any other ) . the other is categories used by the police when they visually identify someone as belonging to an ethnic group , e.g. at the time of a stop and search or an arrest : white - north european ( ic1 ) , white - south european ( ic2 ) , black ( ic3 ) , asian ( ic4 ) , chinese , japanese , or south east asian ( ic5 ) , middle eastern ( ic6 ) , and unknown ( ic0 ) . " ic " stands for " identification code ; " these items are also referred to as phoenix classifications . officers are instructed to " record the response that has been given " even if the person gives an answer which may be incorrect ; their own perception of the person 's ethnic background is recorded separately . comparability of the information being recorded by officers was brought into question by the office for national statistics ( ons ) in september 2007 , as part of its equality data review ; one problem cited was the number of reports that contained an ethnicity of " not stated . "
karl marx published the communist manifesto in february 1848 , with little attention . however , a few days later the french revolution of 1848 broke out , which replaced the monarchy of louis philippe with the second french republic . in june 1848 , paris workers , disenchanted with the new government , built barricades and raised red flags . the new government called in the french army to put down the uprising , the first of many such confrontations between the army and the new worker 's movements in europe .
tensions between john and the barons had been growing for several years , as demonstrated by the 1212 plot against the king . many of the disaffected barons came from the north of england ; that faction was often labelled by contemporaries and historians as " the northerners . " the northern barons rarely had any personal stake in the conflict in france , and many of them owed large sums of money to john ; the revolt has been characterised as " a rebellion of the king 's debtors . " many of john 's military household joined the rebels , particularly amongst those that john had appointed to administrative roles across england ; their local links and loyalties outweighed their personal loyalty to john . tension also grew across north wales , where opposition to the 1211 treaty between john and llywelyn was turning into open conflict . for some the appointment of peter des roches as justiciar was an important factor , as he was considered an " abrasive foreigner " by many of the barons . the failure of john 's french military campaign in 1214 was probably the final straw that precipitated the baronial uprising during john 's final years as king ; james holt describes the path to civil war as " direct , short and unavoidable " following the defeat at bouvines .
several of the city 's large general museums are located near the boulevard . on boulevard proper are the virginia historical society and the virginia museum of fine arts , lending their name to what is sometimes called the museum district . nearby on broad street is the science museum of virginia , housed in the neoclassical former 1919 broad street union station . immediately adjacent is the children 's museum of richmond , and two blocks away , the virginia center for architecture . within the downtown are the library of virginia and the valentine richmond history center . elsewhere are the virginia holocaust museum and the old dominion railway museum .
the majority of freemasonry considers the liberal ( continental ) strand to be irregular , and thus withhold recognition . for the continental lodges , however , having a different approach to freemasonry was not a reason for severing masonic ties . in 1961 , an umbrella organisation , centre de liaison et d 'information des puissances maconniques signataires de l 'appel de strasbourg ( clipsas ) was set up , which today provides a forum for most of these grand lodges and grand orients worldwide . included in the list of over 70 grand lodges and grand orients are representatives of all three of the above categories , including mixed and women 's organisations . the united grand lodge of england does not communicate with any of these jurisdictions , and expects its allies to follow suit . this creates the distinction between anglo-american and continental freemasonry .
according to the constitution , executive power is exercised by the president of the republic and the government . from the constitutional amendment of 1986 the president 's duties were curtailed to a significant extent , and they are now largely ceremonial ; most political power thus lies in the hands of the prime minister . the position of prime minister , greece 's head of government , belongs to the current leader of the political party that can obtain a vote of confidence by the parliament . the president of the republic formally appoints the prime minister and , on his recommendation , appoints and dismisses the other members of the cabinet .
the area receives about 820 millimetres ( 32.3 in ) of annual rainfall , which is concentrated from june through september / october with little or no precipitation the remainder of the year . the area has two main seasons . the rainy season runs from june to october when winds bring in tropical moisture from the sea . the dry season runs from november to may , when the air is relatively drier . this dry season subdivides into a cold period and a warm period . the cold period spans from november to february when polar air masses push down from the north and keep the air fairly dry . the warm period extends from march to may when tropical winds again dominate but do not yet carry enough moisture for rain .
after a lull during the period of modern architectural dominance ( roughly post-world war ii until the mid-1980s ) , neoclassicism has seen somewhat of a resurgence . this rebirth can be traced to the movement of new urbanism and postmodern architecture 's embrace of classical elements as ironic , especially in light of the dominance of modernism . while some continued to work with classicism as ironic , some architects such as thomas gordon smith , began to consider classicism seriously . while some schools had interest in classical architecture , such as the university of virginia , no school was purely dedicated to classical architecture . in the early 1990s a program in classical architecture was started by smith and duncan stroik at the university of notre dame that continues successfully . programs at the university of miami , andrews university , judson university and the prince 's foundation for building community have trained a number of new classical architects since this resurgence . today one can find numerous buildings embracing neoclassical style , since a generation of architects trained in this discipline shapes urban planning .
according to presentism , time is an ordering of various realities . at a certain time some things exist and others do not . this is the only reality we can deal with and we cannot for example say that homer exists because at the present time he does not . an eternalist , on the other hand , holds that time is a dimension of reality on a par with the three spatial dimensions , and hence that all things - past , present , and future - can be said to be just as real as things in the present . according to this theory , then , homer really does exist , though we must still use special language when talking about somebody who exists at a distant time - just as we would use special language when talking about something far away ( the very words near , far , above , below , and such are directly comparable to phrases such as in the past , a minute ago , and so on ) .
ann arbor has a long history of openness to marijuana , given ann arbor 's decriminalization of cannabis , the large number of medical marijuana dispensaries in the city ( one dispensary , called people 's co-op , was directly across the street from michigan stadium until zoning forced it to move one mile to the west ) , the large number of pro-marijuana residents , and the annual hash bash : an event that is held on the first saturday of april . until ( at least ) the successful passage of michigan 's medical marijuana law , the event had arguably strayed from its initial intent , although for years , a number of attendees have received serious legal responses due to marijuana use on university of michigan property , which does not fall under the city 's progressive and compassionate ticketing program .
at the close of the 1991 season , a proposal was tabled for the establishment of a new league that would bring more money into the game overall . the founder members agreement , signed on 17 july 1991 by the game 's top-flight clubs , established the basic principles for setting up the fa premier league . the newly formed top division would have commercial independence from the football association and the football league , giving the fa premier league licence to negotiate its own broadcast and sponsorship agreements . the argument given at the time was that the extra income would allow english clubs to compete with teams across europe .
although born to and raised by parents who were ashkenazi , feynman was not only an atheist , but declined to be labelled jewish . he routinely refused to be included in lists or books that classified people by race . he asked to not be included in tina levitan 's the laureates : jewish winners of the nobel prize , writing , " to select , for approbation the peculiar elements that come from some supposedly jewish heredity is to open the door to all kinds of nonsense on racial theory , " and adding ... " at thirteen i was not only converted to other religious views , but i also stopped believing that the jewish people are in any way ' the chosen people ' . "
title vii was perhaps the most controversial of the entire bill . many conservatives accused it of advocating a de facto quota system , and claimed unconstitutionality as it attempts to regulate the workplace . minnesota senator hubert humphrey corrected this notion : " there is nothing in [ title vii ] that will give power to the commission to require hiring , firing , and promotion to meet a racial ' quota . ' [ . . . ] title vii is designed to encourage the hiring on basis of ability and qualifications , not race or religion . " title vii prohibits discrimination . humphrey was the silent hero of the bill 's passing through congress . he pledged that the bill required no quotas , just nondiscrimination . doing so , he convinced many pro-business republicans , including senate minority leader everett dirksen ( il ) to support title vii . : 78-80
estonia has pursued the development of the e-state and e-government . internet voting is used in elections in estonia . the first internet voting took place in the 2005 local elections and the first in a parliamentary election was made available for the 2007 elections , in which 30,275 individuals voted over the internet . voters have a chance to invalidate their electronic vote in traditional elections , if they wish to . in 2009 in its eighth worldwide press freedom index , reporters without borders ranked estonia sixth out of 175 countries . in the first ever state of world liberty index report , estonia was ranked first out of 159 countries .
polarization is the sum of the e-plane orientations over time projected onto an imaginary plane perpendicular to the direction of motion of the radio wave . in the most general case , polarization is elliptical , meaning that the polarization of the radio waves varies over time . two special cases are linear polarization ( the ellipse collapses into a line ) as we have discussed above , and circular polarization ( in which the two axes of the ellipse are equal ) . in linear polarization the electric field of the radio wave oscillates back and forth along one direction ; this can be affected by the mounting of the antenna but usually the desired direction is either horizontal or vertical polarization . in circular polarization , the electric field ( and magnetic field ) of the radio wave rotates at the radio frequency circularly around the axis of propagation . circular or elliptically polarized radio waves are designated as right-handed or left-handed using the " thumb in the direction of the propagation " rule . note that for circular polarization , optical researchers use the opposite right hand rule from the one used by radio engineers .
according to the federal bureau of investigation 's uniform crime reports , in 2010 the raleigh police department and other agencies in the city reported 1,740 incidents of violent crime and 12,995 incidents of property crime - far below both the national average and the north carolina average . of the violent crimes reported , 14 were murders , 99 were forcible rapes and 643 were robberies . aggravated assault accounted for 984 of the total violent crimes . property crimes included burglaries which accounted for 3,021 , larcenies for 9,104 and arson for 63 of the total number of incidents . motor vehicle theft accounted for 870 incidents out of the total .
modern geology , like modern chemistry , gradually evolved during the 18th and early 19th centuries . benoit de maillet and the comte de buffon saw the earth as much older than the 6,000 years envisioned by biblical scholars . jean-etienne guettard and nicolas desmarest hiked central france and recorded their observations on some of the first geological maps . aided by chemical experimentation , naturalists such as scotland 's john walker , sweden 's torbern bergman , and germany 's abraham werner created comprehensive classification systems for rocks and minerals - a collective achievement that transformed geology into a cutting edge field by the end of the eighteenth century . these early geologists also proposed a generalized interpretations of earth history that led james hutton , georges cuvier and alexandre brongniart , following in the steps of steno , to argue that layers of rock could be dated by the fossils they contained : a principle first applied to the geology of the paris basin . the use of index fossils became a powerful tool for making geological maps , because it allowed geologists to correlate the rocks in one locality with those of similar age in other , distant localities . over the first half of the 19th century , geologists such as charles lyell , adam sedgwick , and roderick murchison applied the new technique to rocks throughout europe and eastern north america , setting the stage for more detailed , government-funded mapping projects in later decades .
under the antiterrorism and effective death penalty act of 1996 , a state prisoner is ordinarily only allowed one suit for habeas corpus in federal court . if the federal courts refuse to issue a writ of habeas corpus , an execution date may be set . in recent times , however , prisoners have postponed execution through a final round of federal litigation using the civil rights act of 1871 - codified at 42 u.s.c. § 1983 - which allows people to bring lawsuits against state actors to protect their federal constitutional and statutory rights .
in some rare cases , such as with ethiopia and qing dynasty china , the local governments were able to use the treaties to at least mitigate the impact of european colonization . this involved learning the intricacies of european diplomatic customs and then using the treaties to prevent a power from overstepping their agreement or by playing different powers against each other .
in 1877 , john wanamaker opened the united state 's first modern department store in a former pennsylvania railroad freight terminal in philadelphia . wanamakers was the first department store to offer fixed prices marked on every article and also introduced electrical illumination ( 1878 ) , the telephone ( 1879 ) , and the use of pneumatic tubes to transport cash and documents ( 1880 ) to the department store business . subsequent department stores founded in philadelphia included strawbridge and clothier , gimbels , lit brothers , and snellenbergs .
i love new york ( stylized i ❤ ny ) is both a logo and a song that are the basis of an advertising campaign and have been used since 1977 to promote tourism in new york city , and later to promote new york state as well . the trademarked logo , owned by new york state empire state development , appears in souvenir shops and brochures throughout the city and state , some licensed , many not . the song is the state song of new york .
in the everyday world , many individuals sought to divine the future , influence it through magic , or seek vengeance with help from " private " diviners . the state-sanctioned taking of auspices was a form of public divination with the intent of ascertaining the will of the gods , not foretelling the future . secretive consultations between private diviners and their clients were thus suspect . so were divinatory techniques such as astrology when used for illicit , subversive or magical purposes . astrologers and magicians were officially expelled from rome at various times , notably in 139 bc and 33 bc . in 16 bc tiberius expelled them under extreme penalty because an astrologer had predicted his death . " egyptian rites " were particularly suspect : augustus banned them within the pomerium to doubtful effect ; tiberius repeated and extended the ban with extreme force in ad 19 . despite several imperial bans , magic and astrology persisted among all social classes . in the late 1st century ad , tacitus observed that astrologers " would always be banned and always retained at rome . "
the largest cemetery is the cementerio del norte , located in the northern-central part of the city . the central cemetery ( spanish : cementerio central ) , located in barrio sur in the southern area of the city , is one of uruguay 's main cemeteries . it was one of the first cemeteries ( in contrast to church graveyards ) in the country , founded in 1835 in a time where burials were still carried out by the catholic church . it is the burial place of many of the most famous uruguayans , such as eduardo acevedo , delmira agustini , luis batlle berres , jose batlle y ordonez , juan manuel blanes , francois ducasse , father of comte de lautreamont ( isidore ducasse ) , luis alberto de herrera , benito nardone , jose enrique rodo , and juan zorrilla de san martin .
the women 's division of professional wrestling has maintained a recognized world champion since 1937 , when mildred burke won the original world women 's title . she then formed the world women 's wrestling association in the early 1950s and recognized herself as the first champion , although the championship would be vacated upon her retirement in 1956 . the nwa , however , ceased to acknowledge burke as their women 's world champion in 1954 , and instead acknowledged june byers as champion after a controversial finish to a high-profile match between burke and byers that year . upon byers ' retirement in 1964 , the fabulous moolah , who won a junior heavyweight version of the nwa world women 's championship ( the predecessor to the wwe 's women 's championship ) in a tournament back in 1958 , was recognized by most nwa promoters as champion by default .
the farmington canal trail is a rail trail that will eventually run continuously from downtown new haven to northampton , massachusetts . the scenic trail follows the path of the historic new haven and northampton company and the farmington canal . currently , there is a continuous 14-mile ( 23 km ) stretch of the trail from downtown , through hamden and into cheshire , making bicycle commuting between new haven and those suburbs possible . the trail is part of the east coast greenway , a proposed 3,000-mile ( 4,800 km ) bike path that would link every major city on the east coast from florida to maine .
in october 2014 , the trial of six senior staff and journalists at the sun newspaper began . all six were charged with conspiring to commit misconduct in a public office . they included the sun 's head of news chris pharo , who faced six charges , while ex-managing editor graham dudman and ex-sun deputy news editor ben o 'driscoll were accused of four charges each . thames valley district reporter jamie pyatt and picture editor john edwards were charged with three counts each , while ex-reporter john troup was accused of two counts . the trial related to illegal payments allegedly made to public officials , with prosecutors saying the men conspired to pay officials from 2002-11 , including police , prison officers and soldiers . they were accused of buying confidential information about the royal family , public figures and prison inmates . they all denied the charges . on 16 january 2015 , troup and edwards were cleared by the jury of all charges against them . the jury also partially cleared o 'driscoll and dudman but continued deliberating over other counts faced by them , as well as the charges against pharo and pyatt . on 21 january 2015 , the jury told the court that it was unable to reach unanimous verdicts on any of the outstanding charges and was told by the judge , richard marks , that he would accept majority verdicts . shortly afterwards , one of the jurors sent a note to the judge and was discharged . the judge told the remaining 11 jurors that their colleague had been " feeling unwell and feeling under a great deal of pressure and stress from the situation you are in , " and that under the circumstances he was prepared to accept majority verdicts of " 11 to zero or 10 to 1 . " on 22 january 2015 , the jury was discharged after failing to reach verdicts on the outstanding charges . the crown prosecution service ( cps ) announced that it would seek a retrial .
dryer and rockier uplands and ridges are occupied by oak-chestnut type forests dominated by a variety of oaks ( quercus spp . ) , hickories ( carya spp . ) and , in the past , by the american chestnut ( castanea dentata ) . the american chestnut was virtually eliminated as a canopy species by the introduced fungal chestnut blight ( cryphonectaria parasitica ) , but lives on as sapling-sized sprouts that originate from roots , which are not killed by the fungus . in present-day forest canopies chestnut has been largely replaced by oaks .
before prince albert 's death , the palace was frequently the scene of musical entertainments , and the greatest contemporary musicians entertained at buckingham palace . the composer felix mendelssohn is known to have played there on three occasions . johann strauss ii and his orchestra played there when in england . strauss 's " alice polka " was first performed at the palace in 1849 in honour of the queen 's daughter , princess alice . under victoria , buckingham palace was frequently the scene of lavish costume balls , in addition to the usual royal ceremonies , investitures and presentations .
critics argue napoleon 's true legacy must reflect the loss of status for france and needless deaths brought by his rule : historian victor davis hanson writes , " after all , the military record is unquestioned - 17 years of wars , perhaps six million europeans dead , france bankrupt , her overseas colonies lost . " mclynn notes that , " he can be viewed as the man who set back european economic life for a generation by the dislocating impact of his wars . " however , vincent cronin replies that such criticism relies on the flawed premise that napoleon was responsible for the wars which bear his name , when in fact france was the victim of a series of coalitions which aimed to destroy the ideals of the revolution .
part of the haunted mansion attraction at disneyland in anaheim , california , and disneyland in paris , france , takes place on an elevator . the " stretching room " on the ride is actually an elevator that travels downwards , giving access to a short underground tunnel which leads to the rest of the attraction . the elevator has no ceiling and its shaft is decorated to look like walls of a mansion . because there is no roof , passengers are able to see the walls of the shaft by looking up , which gives the illusion of the room stretching .
in the united states and elsewhere in the world , there has been a marked rise in the evangelical wing of protestant denominations , especially those that are more exclusively evangelical , and a corresponding decline in the mainstream liberal churches . in the post-world war i era , liberal christianity was on the rise , and a considerable number of seminaries held and taught from a liberal perspective as well . in the post-world war ii era , the trend began to swing back towards the conservative camp in america 's seminaries and church structures .
in may 2005 , the first high definition video conferencing systems , produced by lifesize communications , were displayed at the interop trade show in las vegas , nevada , able to provide video at 30 frames per second with a 1280 by 720 display resolution . polycom introduced its first high definition video conferencing system to the market in 2006 . as of the 2010s , high definition resolution for videoconferencing became a popular feature , with most major suppliers in the videoconferencing market offering it .
in late 1975 , queen recorded and released a night at the opera , taking its name from the popular marx brothers movie . at the time , it was the most expensive album ever produced . like its predecessor , the album features diverse musical styles and experimentation with stereo sound . in " the prophet 's song , " an eight-minute epic , the middle section is a canon , with simple phrases layered to create a full-choral sound . the mercury penned ballad , " love of my life , " featured a harp and overdubbed vocal harmonies . the album was very successful in britain , and went triple platinum in the united states . the british public voted it the 13th greatest album of all time in a 2004 channel 4 poll . it has also ranked highly in international polls ; in a worldwide guinness poll , it was voted the 19th greatest of all time , while an abc poll saw the australian public vote it the 28th greatest of all time . a night at the opera has frequently appeared in " greatest albums " lists reflecting the opinions of critics . among other accolades , it was ranked number 16 in q magazine 's " the 50 best british albums ever " in 2004 , and number 11 in rolling stone 's " the 100 greatest albums of all time " as featured in their mexican edition in 2004 . it was also placed at no. 230 on rolling stone magazine 's list of " the 500 greatest albums of all time " in 2003 . a night at the opera is the third and final queen album to be featured in the book 1001 albums you must hear before you die .
the slave trade was engaged in by european state and non-state actors such as great britain , the netherlands , portugal and private companies , as well as various african states and non-state actors . with rising anti-slavery sentiment at home and changing economic realities , great britain outlawed the international slave trade in 1807 . following the napoleonic wars , great britain established the west africa squadron in an attempt to halt the international traffic in slaves . it stopped ships of other nations that were leaving the african coast with slaves ; the seized slaves were taken to freetown , a colony in west africa originally established for the resettlement of freed slaves from britain . britain intervened in the lagos kingship power struggle by bombarding lagos in 1851 , deposing the slave trade friendly oba kosoko , helping to install the amenable oba akitoye , and signing the treaty between great britain and lagos on 1 january 1852 . britain annexed lagos as a crown colony in august 1861 with the lagos treaty of cession . british missionaries expanded their operations and travelled further inland . in 1864 , samuel ajayi crowther became the first african bishop of the anglican church .
in 1830 , the duchess of kent and conroy took victoria across the centre of england to visit the malvern hills , stopping at towns and great country houses along the way . similar journeys to other parts of england and wales were taken in 1832 , 1833 , 1834 and 1835 . to the king 's annoyance , victoria was enthusiastically welcomed in each of the stops . william compared the journeys to royal progresses and was concerned that they portrayed victoria as his rival rather than his heiress presumptive . victoria disliked the trips ; the constant round of public appearances made her tired and ill , and there was little time for her to rest . she objected on the grounds of the king 's disapproval , but her mother dismissed his complaints as motivated by jealousy , and forced victoria to continue the tours . at ramsgate in october 1835 , victoria contracted a severe fever , which conroy initially dismissed as a childish pretence . while victoria was ill , conroy and the duchess unsuccessfully badgered her to make conroy her private secretary . as a teenager , victoria resisted persistent attempts by her mother and conroy to appoint him to her staff . once queen , she banned him from her presence , but he remained in her mother 's household .
uranium-238 is the most stable isotope of uranium , with a half-life of about 4.468 × 109 years , roughly the age of the earth . uranium-235 has a half-life of about 7.13 × 108 years , and uranium-234 has a half-life of about 2.48 × 105 years . for natural uranium , about 49 % of its alpha rays are emitted by each of 238u atom , and also 49 % by 234u ( since the latter is formed from the former ) and about 2.0 % of them by the 235u . when the earth was young , probably about one-fifth of its uranium was uranium-235 , but the percentage of 234u was probably much lower than this .
soon after the passing of the 1931 act , in the book published on the occasion of the institute 's centenary celebration in 1934 , harry barnes , friba , chairman of the registration committee , mentioned that arcuk could not be a rival of any architectural association , least of all the riba , given the way arcuk was constituted . barnes commented that the act 's purpose was not protecting the architectural profession , and that the legitimate interests of the profession were best served by the ( then ) architectural associations in which some 80 per cent of those practising architecture were to be found .
throughout the 20th century air defence was one of the fastest-evolving areas of military technology , responding to the evolution of aircraft and exploiting various enabling technologies , particularly radar , guided missiles and computing ( initially electromechanical analog computing from the 1930s on , as with equipment described below ) . air defence evolution covered the areas of sensors and technical fire control , weapons , and command and control . at the start of the 20th century these were either very primitive or non-existent .
infrared radiation is popularly known as " heat radiation " [ citation needed ] , but light and electromagnetic waves of any frequency will heat surfaces that absorb them . infrared light from the sun accounts for 49 % of the heating of earth , with the rest being caused by visible light that is absorbed then re-radiated at longer wavelengths . visible light or ultraviolet-emitting lasers can char paper and incandescently hot objects emit visible radiation . objects at room temperature will emit radiation concentrated mostly in the 8 to 25 µm band , but this is not distinct from the emission of visible light by incandescent objects and ultraviolet by even hotter objects ( see black body and wien 's displacement law ) .
the purpose of electronic warfare is to deny the opponent an advantage in the ems and ensure friendly , unimpeded access to the em spectrum portion of the information environment . electronic warfare aircraft are used to keep airspaces friendly , and send critical information to anyone who needs it . they are often called " the eye in the sky . " the roles of the aircraft vary greatly among the different variants to include electronic warfare / jamming ( ec-130h ) , psychological operations / communications ( ec-130j ) , airborne early warning and control ( e-3 ) , airborne command post ( e-4b ) , ground targeting radar ( e-8c ) , range control ( e-9a ) , and communications relay ( e-11a )
in 1817 the saxon palace was requisitioned by warsaw 's russian governor for military use , and the warsaw lyceum was reestablished in the kazimierz palace ( today the rectorate of warsaw university ) . fryderyk and his family moved to a building , which still survives , adjacent to the kazimierz palace . during this period , fryderyk was sometimes invited to the belweder palace as playmate to the son of the ruler of russian poland , grand duke constantine ; he played the piano for the duke and composed a march for him . julian ursyn niemcewicz , in his dramatic eclogue , " nasze przebiegi " ( " our discourses , " 1818 ) , attested to " little chopin 's " popularity .
on 11 july , nasser replaced amer with mohamed fawzi as general commander , over the protestations of amer 's loyalists in the military , 600 of whom marched on army headquarters and demanded amer 's reinstatement . after nasser sacked thirty of the loyalists in response , amer and his allies devised a plan to topple him on 27 august . nasser was tipped off about their activities and , after several invitations , he convinced amer to meet him at his home on 24 august . nasser confronted amer about the coup plot , which he denied before being arrested by mohieddin . amer committed suicide on 14 september . despite his souring relationship with amer , nasser spoke of losing " the person closest to [ him ] . " thereafter , nasser began a process of depoliticizing the armed forces , arresting dozens of leading military and intelligence figures loyal to amer .
despite popular conceptions promoted by movies and television , many us police departments prefer not to maintain officers in non-patrol bureaus and divisions beyond a certain period of time , such as in the detective bureau , and instead maintain policies that limit service in such divisions to a specified period of time , after which officers must transfer out or return to patrol duties . [ citation needed ] this is done in part based upon the perception that the most important and essential police work is accomplished on patrol in which officers become acquainted with their beats , prevent crime by their presence , respond to crimes in progress , manage crises , and practice their skills .

there is no clear mechanism by which these local trade organisations became today 's masonic lodges , but the earliest rituals and passwords known , from operative lodges around the turn of the 17th-18th centuries , show continuity with the rituals developed in the later 18th century by accepted or speculative masons , as those members who did not practice the physical craft came to be known . the minutes of the lodge of edinburgh ( mary 's chapel ) no. 1 in scotland show a continuity from an operative lodge in 1598 to a modern speculative lodge . it is reputed to be the oldest masonic lodge in the world .
the golden boot is awarded to the top premier league scorer at the end of each season . former blackburn rovers and newcastle united striker alan shearer holds the record for most premier league goals with 260 . twenty-four players have reached the 100-goal mark . since the first premier league season in 1992-93 , 14 different players from 10 different clubs have won or shared the top scorers title . thierry henry won his fourth overall scoring title by scoring 27 goals in the 2005-06 season . andrew cole and alan shearer hold the record for most goals in a season ( 34 ) - for newcastle and blackburn respectively . ryan giggs of manchester united holds the record for scoring goals in consecutive seasons , having scored in the first 21 seasons of the league .
artists such as gary numan , the human league , soft cell , john foxx and visage helped pioneer a new synthpop style that drew more heavily from electronic and synthesizer music and benefited from the rise of mtv . post-punk artists such as scritti politti 's green gartside and josef k 's paul haig , previously engaged in avant-garde practices , turned away from these approaches and pursued mainstream styles and commercial success . these new developments , in which post-punk artists attempted to bring subversive ideas into the pop mainstream , began to be categorized under the marketing term new pop .
in the 1980s , 1990s , and 2000s , terrorist attacks in egypt became numerous and severe , and began to target christian copts , foreign tourists and government officials . in the 1990s an islamist group , al-gama 'a al-islamiyya , engaged in an extended campaign of violence , from the murders and attempted murders of prominent writers and intellectuals , to the repeated targeting of tourists and foreigners . serious damage was done to the largest sector of egypt 's economy - tourism - and in turn to the government , but it also devastated the livelihoods of many of the people on whom the group depended for support .
a number of vessels visiting the islands were attacked and their crews killed . in 1834 , captain donsette and his crew were killed . similarly , in 1845 the schooner naiad punished a native for stealing with such violence that the natives attacked the ship . later that year a whaler 's boat crew were killed . in 1852 the san francisco-based ships glencoe and sea nymph were attacked and everyone aboard except for one crew member were killed . the violence was usually attributed as a response to the ill treatment of the natives in response to petty theft , which was a common practice . in 1857 , two missionaries successfully settled on ebon , living among the natives through at least 1870 . : 3
india 's cotton-processing sector gradually declined during british expansion in india and the establishment of colonial rule during the late 18th and early 19th centuries . this was largely due to aggressive colonialist mercantile policies of the british east india company , which made cotton processing and manufacturing workshops in india uncompetitive . indian markets were increasingly forced to supply only raw cotton and , by british-imposed law , to purchase manufactured textiles from britain .

the pricing of risk refers to the incremental compensation required by investors for taking on additional risk , which may be measured by interest rates or fees . several scholars have argued that a lack of transparency about banks ' risk exposures prevented markets from correctly pricing risk before the crisis , enabled the mortgage market to grow larger than it otherwise would have , and made the financial crisis far more disruptive than it would have been if risk levels had been disclosed in a straightforward , readily understandable format .

in the early 1980s , philips produced a laserdisc player model adapted for a computer interface , dubbed " professional . " in 1985 , jasmine multimedia created laserdisc juke boxes featuring music videos from michael jackson , duran duran , and cyndi lauper . when connected to a pc this combination could be used to display images or information for educational or archival purposes , for example thousands of scanned medieval manuscripts . this strange device could be considered a very early equivalent of a cd-rom .
at a certain temperature , ( usually between 1,500 ° f ( 820 ° c ) and 1,600 ° f ( 870 ° c ) , depending on carbon content ) , the base metal of steel undergoes a change in the arrangement of the atoms in its crystal matrix , called allotropy . this allows the small carbon atoms to enter the interstices of the iron crystal , diffusing into the iron matrix . when this happens , the carbon atoms are said to be in solution , or mixed with the iron , forming a single , homogeneous , crystalline phase called austenite . if the steel is cooled slowly , the iron will gradually change into its low temperature allotrope . when this happens the carbon atoms will no longer be soluble with the iron , and will be forced to precipitate out of solution , nucleating into the spaces between the crystals . the steel then becomes heterogeneous , being formed of two phases ; the carbon ( carbide ) phase cementite , and ferrite . this type of heat treatment produces steel that is rather soft and bendable . however , if the steel is cooled quickly the carbon atoms will not have time to precipitate . when rapidly cooled , a diffusionless ( martensite ) transformation occurs , in which the carbon atoms become trapped in solution . this causes the iron crystals to deform intrinsically when the crystal structure tries to change to its low temperature state , making it very hard and brittle .
in 1996-1997 , a research study was conducted on a large population of middle age students in the cherry creek school district in denver , colorado , usa . the study showed that students who actively listen to classical music before studying had higher academic scores . the research further indicated that students who listened to the music prior to an examination also had positively elevated achievement scores . students who listened to rock-and-roll or country had moderately lower scores . the study further indicated that students who used classical during the course of study had a significant leap in their academic performance ; whereas , those who listened to other types of music had significantly lowered academic scores . the research was conducted over several schools within the cherry creek school district and was conducted through university of colorado . this study is reflective of several recent studies ( i.e. mike manthei and steve n. kelly of the university of nebraska at omaha ; donald a. hodges and debra s. o 'connell of the university of north carolina at greensboro ; etc . ) and others who had significant results through the discourse of their work .
a treaty is an official , express written agreement that states use to legally bind themselves . a treaty is the official document which expresses that agreement in words ; and it is also the objective outcome of a ceremonial occasion which acknowledges the parties and their defined relationships .
china : the torch returned to china for the first time since april . the torch arrived in sanya , hainan on may 4 with celebrations attended by international olympic committee ( ioc ) officials and chinese big names like jackie chan . the entire relay through mainland china was largely a success with many people welcoming the arrival of the torch along the way .
the output of goods and services produced by labor and property located in the united states - decreased at an annual rate of approximately 6 % in the fourth quarter of 2008 and first quarter of 2009 , versus activity in the year-ago periods . the u.s. unemployment rate increased to 10.1 % by october 2009 , the highest rate since 1983 and roughly twice the pre-crisis rate . the average hours per work week declined to 33 , the lowest level since the government began collecting the data in 1964 . with the decline of gross domestic product came the decline in innovation . with fewer resources to risk in creative destruction , the number of patent applications flat-lined . compared to the previous 5 years of exponential increases in patent application , this stagnation correlates to the similar drop in gdp during the same time period .
in evita ( 1996 ) , madonna played the title role of eva peron . for a long time , madonna had desired to play peron and wrote to director alan parker to explain why she would be perfect for the part . she said later , " this is the role i was born to play . i put everything of me into this because it was much more than a role in a movie . it was exhilarating and intimidating at the same time ..... and i am prouder of evita than anything else i have done . " after securing the role , she had vocal training and learned about the history of argentina and peron . during shooting she became ill several times due to the intense emotional effort required . however , as she told oprah , she was also pregnant during the filming : " i was winded after every take . i had to lie on the couch every ten minutes so i could recover from dizzy spells , i was worried that i was shaking the baby around too much and that would injure it in some way . " madonna wrote in her personal diary at the time : " ironically , this feeling of vulnerability and weakness is helping me in the movie . i 'm sure evita felt this way every day of her life once she discovered she was ill .

feminist economists ailsa mckay and margunn bjørnholt argue that the financial crisis and the response to it revealed a crisis of ideas in mainstream economics and within the economics profession , and call for a reshaping of both the economy , economic theory and the economics profession . they argue that such a reshaping should include new advances within feminist economics and ecological economics that take as their starting point the socially responsible , sensible and accountable subject in creating an economy and economic theories that fully acknowledge care for each other as well as the planet .
the relative pitches of individual notes in a scale may be determined by one of a number of tuning systems . in the west , the twelve-note chromatic scale is the most common method of organization , with equal temperament now the most widely used method of tuning that scale . in it , the pitch ratio between any two successive notes of the scale is exactly the twelfth root of two ( or about 1.05946 ) . in well-tempered systems ( as used in the time of johann sebastian bach , for example ) , different methods of musical tuning were used . almost all of these systems have one interval in common , the octave , where the pitch of one note is double the frequency of another . for example , if the a above middle c is 440 hz , the a an octave above that is 880 hz ( info ) .
there are several details that are only found in one of the gospel accounts . for instance , only matthew 's gospel mentions an earthquake , resurrected saints who went to the city and that roman soldiers were assigned to guard the tomb , while mark is the only one to state the actual time of the crucifixion ( the third hour , or 9 am ) and the centurion 's report of jesus ' death . the gospel of luke 's unique contributions to the narrative include jesus ' words to the women who were mourning , one criminal 's rebuke of the other , the reaction of the multitudes who left " beating their breasts , " and the women preparing spices and ointments before resting on the sabbath . john is also the only one to refer to the request that the legs be broken and the soldier 's subsequent piercing of jesus ' side ( as fulfillment of old testament prophecy ) , as well as that nicodemus assisted joseph with burial .
the restoration of power to the patriciate was only temporary . after a period of unrest with repeated violent clashes such as the zuriputsch of 1839 , civil war ( the sonderbundskrieg ) broke out in 1847 when some catholic cantons tried to set up a separate alliance ( the sonderbund ) . the war lasted for less than a month , causing fewer than 100 casualties , most of which were through friendly fire . yet however minor the sonderbundskrieg appears compared with other european riots and wars in the 19th century , it nevertheless had a major impact on both the psychology and the society of the swiss and of switzerland .
ottoman illumination covers non-figurative painted or drawn decorative art in books or on sheets in muraqqa or albums , as opposed to the figurative images of the ottoman miniature . it was a part of the ottoman book arts together with the ottoman miniature ( taswir ) , calligraphy ( hat ) , islamic calligraphy , bookbinding ( cilt ) and paper marbling ( ebru ) . in the ottoman empire , illuminated and illustrated manuscripts were commissioned by the sultan or the administrators of the court . in topkapi palace , these manuscripts were created by the artists working in nakkashane , the atelier of the miniature and illumination artists . both religious and non-religious books could be illuminated . also sheets for albums levha consisted of illuminated calligraphy ( hat ) of tughra , religious texts , verses from poems or proverbs , and purely decorative drawings .
during and after the greek war of independence , greeks of the diaspora were important in establishing the fledgling state , raising funds and awareness abroad . greek merchant families already had contacts in other countries and during the disturbances many set up home around the mediterranean ( notably marseilles in france , livorno in italy , alexandria in egypt ) , russia ( odessa and saint petersburg ) , and britain ( london and liverpool ) from where they traded , typically in textiles and grain . businesses frequently comprised the extended family , and with them they brought schools teaching greek and the greek orthodox church .
it combined the high speed of electronics with the ability to be programmed for many complex problems . it could add or subtract 5000 times a second , a thousand times faster than any other machine . it also had modules to multiply , divide , and square root . high speed memory was limited to 20 words ( about 80 bytes ) . built under the direction of john mauchly and j. presper eckert at the university of pennsylvania , eniac 's development and construction lasted from 1943 to full operation at the end of 1945 . the machine was huge , weighing 30 tons , using 200 kilowatts of electric power and contained over 18,000 vacuum tubes , 1,500 relays , and hundreds of thousands of resistors , capacitors , and inductors .
the mosaic pavement of the vrina plain basilica of butrint , albania appear to pre-date that of the baptistery by almost a generation , dating to the last quarter of the 5th or the first years of the 6th century . the mosaic displays a variety of motifs including sea-creatures , birds , terrestrial beasts , fruits , flowers , trees and abstracts - designed to depict a terrestrial paradise of god 's creation . superimposed on this scheme are two large tablets , tabulae ansatae , carrying inscriptions . a variety of fish , a crab , a lobster , shrimps , mushrooms , flowers , a stag and two cruciform designs surround the smaller of the two inscriptions , which reads : in fulfilment of the vow ( prayer ) of those whose names god knows . this anonymous dedicatory inscription is a public demonstration of the benefactors ' humility and an acknowledgement of god 's omniscience .
in a small minority of muslim countries , the law requires women to cover either just legs , shoulders and head or the whole body apart from the face . in strictest forms , the face as well must be covered leaving just a mesh to see through . these rules for dressing cause tensions , concerning particularly muslims living in western countries , where restrictions are considered both sexist and oppressive . some muslims oppose this charge , and instead declare that the media in these countries presses on women to reveal too much in order to be deemed attractive , and that this is itself sexist and oppressive .
peace negotiations at the congress of paris resulted in the signing of the treaty of paris on 30 march 1856 . in compliance with article iii , russia restored to the ottoman empire the city and citadel of kars in common with " all other parts of the ottoman territory of which the russian troop were in possession . " russia ceded some land in bessarabia at the mouth of the danube to moldavia . by article iv the united kingdom , france , sardinia and turkey restored to russia " the towns and ports of sevastopol , balaklava , kamish , eupatoria , kerch , jenikale , kinburn , as well as all other territories occupied by the allied troops . " in conformity with article xi and xiii , the tsar and the sultan agreed not to establish any naval or military arsenal on the black sea coast . the black sea clauses weakened russia , and it no longer posed a naval threat to the ottomans . the principalities of moldavia and wallachia were nominally returned to the ottoman empire ; in practice they became independent . the great powers pledged to respect the independence and territorial integrity of the ottoman empire . : 432-33
napoleon 's set of civil laws , the code civil - now often known as the napoleonic code - was prepared by committees of legal experts under the supervision of jean jacques regis de cambaceres , the second consul . napoleon participated actively in the sessions of the council of state that revised the drafts . the development of the code was a fundamental change in the nature of the civil law legal system with its stress on clearly written and accessible law . other codes ( " les cinq codes " ) were commissioned by napoleon to codify criminal and commerce law ; a code of criminal instruction was published , which enacted rules of due process .
all versions incorporate a top-loading slot for game cartridges , although the shape of the slot differs between regions to match the different shapes of the cartridges . the multi out connector ( later used on the nintendo 64 and gamecube ) can output composite video , s-video and rgb signals , as well as rf with an external rf modulator . original versions additionally include a 28-pin expansion port under a small cover on the bottom of the unit and a standard rf output with channel selection switch on the back ; the redesigned models output composite video only , requiring an external modulator for rf .
the serbo-croatian dialects differ not only in the question word they are named after , but also heavily in phonology , accentuation and intonation , case endings and tense system ( morphology ) and basic vocabulary . in the past , chakavian and kajkavian dialects were spoken on a much larger territory , but have been replaced by stokavian during the period of migrations caused by ottoman turkish conquest of the balkans in the 15th and the 16th centuries . these migrations caused the koineisation of the shtokavian dialects , that used to form the west shtokavian ( more closer and transitional towards the neighbouring chakavian and kajkavian dialects ) and east shtokavian ( transitional towards the torlakian and the whole bulgaro-macedonian area ) dialect bundles , and their subsequent spread at the expense of chakavian and kajkavian . as a result , stokavian now covers an area larger than all the other dialects combined , and continues to make its progress in the enclaves where non-literary dialects are still being spoken .
by 1937 , japan controlled manchuria and was ready to move deeper into china . the marco polo bridge incident on 7 july 1937 provoked full-scale war between china and japan . the nationalist and communist chinese suspended their civil war to form a nominal alliance against japan , and the soviet union quickly lent support by providing large amount of materiel to chinese troops . in august 1937 , generalissimo chiang kai-shek deployed his best army to fight about 300,000 japanese troops in shanghai , but , after three months of fighting , shanghai fell . the japanese continued to push the chinese forces back , capturing the capital nanking in december 1937 and committed which was known as nanking massacre . in march 1938 , nationalist forces won their first victory at taierzhuang. but then the city of xuzhou was taken by japanese in may . in june 1938 , japan deployed about 350,000 troops to invade wuhan and captured it in october . the japanese achieved major military victories , but world opinion - in particular in the united states - condemned japan , especially after the panay incident .
polish composers of the following generation included virtuosi such as moritz moszkowski , but , in the opinion of j. barrie jones , his " one worthy successor " among his compatriots was karol szymanowski ( 1882-1937 ) . edvard grieg , antonin dvorak , isaac albeniz , pyotr ilyich tchaikovsky and sergei rachmaninoff , among others , are regarded by critics as having been influenced by chopin 's use of national modes and idioms . alexander scriabin was devoted to the music of chopin , and his early published works include nineteen mazurkas , as well as numerous etudes and preludes ; his teacher nikolai zverev drilled him in chopin 's works to improve his virtuosity as a performer . in the 20th century , composers who paid homage to ( or in some cases parodied ) the music of chopin included george crumb , bohuslav martinu , darius milhaud , igor stravinsky and heitor villa-lobos .
contemporary a cappella includes many vocal groups and bands who add vocal percussion or beatboxing to create a pop / rock / gospel sound , in some cases very similar to bands with instruments . examples of such professional groups include straight no chaser , pentatonix , the house jacks , rockapella , mosaic , and m-pact . there also remains a strong a cappella presence within christian music , as some denominations purposefully do not use instruments during worship . examples of such groups are take 6 , glad and acappella . arrangements of popular music for small a cappella ensembles typically include one voice singing the lead melody , one singing a rhythmic bass line , and the remaining voices contributing chordal or polyphonic accompaniment .
the top ten ( eleven in season ten ) toured at the end of every season . in the season twelve tour a semi-finalist who won a sing-off was also added to the tour . kellogg 's pop-tarts was the sponsor for the first seven seasons , and guitar hero was added for the season seven tour . m & m 's pretzel chocolate candies was a sponsor of the season nine tour . the season five tour was the most successful tour with gross of over $ 35 million .
the 2009 human development report by undp was released on october 5 , 2009 , and covers the period up to 2007 . it was titled " overcoming barriers : human mobility and development . " the top countries by hdi were grouped in a new category called " very high human development . " the report refers to these countries as developed countries . they are :
ancient tables provided the sun 's mean longitude . christopher clavius , the architect of the gregorian calendar , noted that the tables agreed neither on the time when the sun passed through the vernal equinox nor on the length of the mean tropical year . tycho brahe also noticed discrepancies . the gregorian leap year rule ( 97 leap years in 400 years ) was put forward by petrus pitatus of verona in 1560 . he noted that it is consistent with the tropical year of the alfonsine tables and with the mean tropical year of copernicus ( de revolutionibus ) and reinhold ( prutenic tables ) . the three mean tropical years in babylonian sexagesimals as the excess over 365 days ( the way they would have been extracted from the tables of mean longitude ) were 14,33,9,57 ( alphonsine ) , 14,33,11,12 ( copernicus ) and 14,33,9,24 ( reinhold ) . all values are the same to two places ( 14 : 33 ) and this is also the mean length of the gregorian year . thus pitatus ' solution would have commended itself to the astronomers .
her mature artistic statement was visible in true blue ( 1986 ) and like a prayer ( 1989 ) . in true blue , she incorporated classical music in order to engage an older audience who had been skeptical of her music . like a prayer introduced live recorded songs and incorporated different genres of music , including dance , funk , r & b and gospel music . her versatility was further shown on i 'm breathless , which consists predominantly of the 1940s broadway showtune-flavoured jazz , swing and big band tracks . madonna continued to compose ballads and uptempo dance songs for erotica ( 1992 ) and bedtime stories ( 1994 ) . both albums explored element of new jack swing , with jim farber from entertainment weekly saying that " she could actually be viewed as new jack swing 's godmother . " she tried to remain contemporary by incorporating samples , drum loops and hip hop into her music . with ray of light , madonna brought electronic music from its underground status into massive popularity in mainstream music scene .
animals typically use the color green as camouflage , blending in with the chlorophyll green of the surrounding environment . green animals include , especially , amphibians , reptiles , and some fish , birds and insects . most fish , reptiles , amphibians , and birds appear green because of a reflection of blue light coming through an over-layer of yellow pigment . perception of color can also be affected by the surrounding environment . for example , broadleaf forests typically have a yellow-green light about them as the trees filter the light . turacoverdin is one chemical which can cause a green hue in birds , especially . invertebrates such as insects or mollusks often display green colors because of porphyrin pigments , sometimes caused by diet . this can causes their feces to look green as well . other chemicals which generally contribute to greenness among organisms are flavins ( lychochromes ) and hemanovadin . humans have imitated this by wearing green clothing as a camouflage in military and other fields . substances that may impart a greenish hue to one 's skin include biliverdin , the green pigment in bile , and ceruloplasmin , a protein that carries copper ions in chelation .
the average population density was 11,457 people per square mile ( 4,405.4 / km ² ) . the census reported that 1,468,623 people ( 96.2 % of the population ) lived in households , 38,007 ( 2.5 % ) lived in non-institutionalized group quarters , and 19,376 ( 1.3 % ) were institutionalized . in 2013 , the city reported having 668,247 total housing units , down slightly from 670,171 housing units in 2010 . as of 2013 [ update ] , 87 percent of housing units were occupied , while 13 percent were vacant , a slight change from 2010 where 89.5 percent of units were occupied , or 599,736 and 10.5 percent were vacant , or 70,435 . of the city 's residents , 32 percent reported having no vehicles available while 23 percent had two or more vehicles available , as of 2013 [ update ] .
pharmaceutical fraud involves deceptions which bring financial gain to a pharmaceutical company . it affects individuals and public and private insurers . there are several different schemes used to defraud the health care system which are particular to the pharmaceutical industry . these include : good manufacturing practice ( gmp ) violations , off label marketing , best price fraud , cme fraud , medicaid price reporting , and manufactured compound drugs . of this amount $ 2.5 billion was recovered through false claims act cases in fy 2010 . examples of fraud cases include the glaxosmithkline $ 3 billion settlement , pfizer $ 2.3 billion settlement and merck & co . $ 650 million settlement . damages from fraud can be recovered by use of the false claims act , most commonly under the qui tam provisions which rewards an individual for being a " whistleblower , " or relator ( law ) .
in the context of trademarks , this expansion has been driven by international efforts to harmonise the definition of " trademark , " as exemplified by the agreement on trade-related aspects of intellectual property rights ratified in 1994 , which formalized regulations for ip rights that had been handled by common law , or not at all , in member states . pursuant to trips , any sign which is " capable of distinguishing " the products or services of one business from the products or services of another business is capable of constituting a trademark .
prior to einstein 's paper , electromagnetic radiation such as visible light was considered to behave as a wave : hence the use of the terms " frequency " and " wavelength " to characterise different types of radiation . the energy transferred by a wave in a given time is called its intensity . the light from a theatre spotlight is more intense than the light from a domestic lightbulb ; that is to say that the spotlight gives out more energy per unit time and per unit space ( and hence consumes more electricity ) than the ordinary bulb , even though the colour of the light might be very similar . other waves , such as sound or the waves crashing against a seafront , also have their own intensity . however , the energy account of the photoelectric effect didn 't seem to agree with the wave description of light .
some of his friends provided music at his request ; among them , potocka sang and franchomme played the cello . chopin requested that his body be opened after death ( for fear of being buried alive ) and his heart returned to warsaw where it rests at the church of the holy cross . he also bequeathed his unfinished notes on a piano tuition method , projet de methode , to alkan for completion . on 17 october , after midnight , the physician leaned over him and asked whether he was suffering greatly . " no longer , " he replied . he died a few minutes before two o 'clock in the morning . those present at the deathbed appear to have included his sister ludwika , princess marcelina czartoryska , sand 's daughter solange , and his close friend thomas albrecht . later that morning , solange 's husband clesinger made chopin 's death mask and a cast of his left hand .
the layout of the inner suburbs on a largely one-mile grid pattern , cut through by wide radial boulevards , and string of gardens surrounding the central city was largely established in the 1850s and 1860s . these areas were rapidly filled from the mid 1850s by the ubiquitous terrace house , as well as detached houses and some grand mansions in large grounds , while some of the major roads developed as shopping streets . melbourne quickly became a major finance centre , home to several banks , the royal mint , and australia 's first stock exchange in 1861 . in 1855 the melbourne cricket club secured possession of its now famous ground , the mcg . members of the melbourne football club codified australian football in 1859 , and yarra rowing clubs and " regattas " became popular about the same time . in 1861 the melbourne cup was first run . in 1864 melbourne acquired its first public monument - the burke and wills statue .
city transportation in strasbourg includes the futurist-looking strasbourg tramway that opened in 1994 and is operated by the regional transit company compagnie des transports strasbourgeois ( cts ) , consisting of 6 lines with a total length of 55.8 km ( 34.7 mi ) . the cts also operates a comprehensive bus network throughout the city that is integrated with the trams . with more than 500 km ( 311 mi ) of bicycle paths , biking in the city is convenient and the cts operates a cheap bike-sharing scheme named velhop ' . the cts , and its predecessors , also operated a previous generation of tram system between 1878 and 1960 , complemented by trolleybus routes between 1939 and 1962 .
marshal macmahon , now closest to wissembourg , spread his four divisions over 20 miles ( 32 km ) to react to any prussian invasion . this organization of forces was due to a lack of supplies , forcing each division to seek out basic provisions along with the representatives of the army supply arm that was supposed to aid them . what made a bad situation much worse was the conduct of general auguste-alexandre ducrot , commander of the 1st division . he told general abel douay , commander of the 2nd division , on 1 august that " the information i have received makes me suppose that the enemy has no considerable forces very near his advance posts , and has no desire to take the offensive . " two days later , he told macmahon that he had not found " a single enemy post ... it looks to me as if the menace of the bavarians is simply bluff . " even though ducrot shrugged off the possibility of an attack by the germans , macmahon tried to warn the other divisions of his army , without success .
the supermarine spitfire was designed and developed in southampton , evolving from the schneider trophy-winning seaplanes of the 1920s and 1930s . its designer , r j mitchell , lived in the portswood area of southampton , and his house is today marked with a blue plaque . heavy bombing of the factory in september 1940 destroyed it as well as homes in the vicinity , killing civilians and workers . world war ii hit southampton particularly hard because of its strategic importance as a major commercial port and industrial area . prior to the invasion of europe , components for a mulberry harbour were built here . after d-day , southampton docks handled military cargo to help keep the allied forces supplied , making it a key target of luftwaffe bombing raids until late 1944 . southampton docks was featured in the television show 24 : live another day in day 9 : 9 : 00 p.m. - 10 : 00 p.m .
similar developments have taken place in other alphabets . the lower-case script for the greek alphabet has its origins in the 7th century and acquired its quadrilinear form in the 8th century . over time , uncial letter forms were increasingly mixed into the script . the earliest dated greek lower-case text is the uspenski gospels ( ms 461 ) in the year 835 . [ citation needed ] the modern practice of capitalising the first letter of every sentence seems to be imported ( and is rarely used when printing ancient greek materials even today ) .
during the 11th and 12th centuries the catalan rulers expanded up to north of the ebro river , and in the 13th century they conquered the land of valencia and the balearic islands . the city of alghero in sardinia was repopulated with catalan speakers in the 14th century . the language also reached murcia , which became spanish-speaking in the 15th century .
micronesians settled the marshall islands in the 2nd millennium bc , but there are no historical or oral records of that period . over time , the marshall island people learned to navigate over long ocean distances by canoe using traditional stick charts .
the word madrasah derives from the triconsonantal semitic root د-ر-س d-r-s ' to learn , study ' , through the wazn ( form / stem ) مفعل ( ة ) ; mafʻal ( ah ) , meaning " a place where something is done . " therefore , madrasah literally means " a place where learning and studying take place . " the word is also present as a loanword with the same innocuous meaning in many arabic-influenced languages , such as : urdu , bengali , hindi , persian , turkish , azeri , kurdish , indonesian , malay and bosnian / croatian . in the arabic language , the word مدرسة madrasah simply means the same as school does in the english language , whether that is private , public or parochial school , as well as for any primary or secondary school whether muslim , non-muslim , or secular . unlike the use of the word school in british english , the word madrasah more closely resembles the term school in american english , in that it can refer to a university-level or post-graduate school as well as to a primary or secondary school . for example , in the ottoman empire during the early modern period , madaris had lower schools and specialised schools where the students became known as danismends . the usual arabic word for a university , however , is جامعة ( jamiʻah ) . the hebrew cognate midrasha also connotes the meaning of a place of learning ; the related term midrash literally refers to study or learning , but has acquired mystical and religious connotations .
human interference has nearly exterminated the trees in many areas , and , except for the beech forests of the austrian alps , forests of deciduous trees are rarely found after the extreme deforestation between the 17th and 19th centuries . the vegetation has changed since the second half of the 20th century , as the high alpine meadows cease to be harvested for hay or used for grazing which eventually might result in a regrowth of forest . in some areas the modern practice of building ski runs by mechanical means has destroyed the underlying tundra from which the plant life cannot recover during the non-skiing months , whereas areas that still practice a natural piste type of ski slope building preserve the fragile underlayers .
homer illustrated paeon the god , and the song both of apotropaic thanksgiving or triumph . [ citation needed ] such songs were originally addressed to apollo , and afterwards to other gods : to dionysus , to apollo helios , to apollo 's son asclepius the healer . about the 4th century bce , the paean became merely a formula of adulation ; its object was either to implore protection against disease and misfortune , or to offer thanks after such protection had been rendered . it was in this way that apollo had become recognised as the god of music . apollo 's role as the slayer of the python led to his association with battle and victory ; hence it became the roman custom for a paean to be sung by an army on the march and before entering into battle , when a fleet left the harbour , and also after a victory had been won .
arc was acquired in 1938 by the columbia broadcasting system ( cbs , which , in turn , had been formed by the columbia phonograph company , but then sold off ) . arc was renamed columbia recording corporation . the columbia phonograph company had international subsidiaries and affiliates such as the columbia graphophone company in the united kingdom , but they were sold off prior to cbs acquiring american columbia . rca victor records executive ted wallerstein convinced cbs head william s. paley to buy arc and paley made wallerstein head of the newly acquired record company . the renamed company made columbia its flagship label with okeh its subsidiary label while deemphasizing arc 's other labels . this allowed arc 's leased labels brunswick records and vocalion records to revert to former owner warner bros. which sold the labels to decca records . columbia kept the brunswick catalogue recorded from december 1931 onward which was reissued on the columbia label as well as the vocalion label material from the same time period which was reissued on the okeh label . wallerstein , who was promoted at the end of 1947 from president to chairman of the record company , restored columbia 's status as a leading record company and spearheaded the successful introduction of the long playing ( lp ) record before he retired as columbia 's chairman in 1951 . james conkling then became head of columbia records . also in 1951 , columbia severed its ties with the emi-owned record label of the same name and began a uk distribution deal with philips records , whereas okeh records continued to be distributed by emi on the columbia label .

new york city has the largest european and non-hispanic white population of any american city . at 2.7 million in 2012 , new york 's non-hispanic white population is larger than the non-hispanic white populations of los angeles ( 1.1 million ) , chicago ( 865,000 ) , and houston ( 550,000 ) combined . the european diaspora residing in the city is very diverse . according to 2012 census estimates , there were roughly 560,000 italian americans , 385,000 irish americans , 253,000 german americans , 223,000 russian americans , 201,000 polish americans , and 137,000 english americans . additionally , greek and french americans numbered 65,000 each , with those of hungarian descent estimated at 60,000 people . ukrainian and scottish americans numbered 55,000 and 35,000 , respectively . people identifying ancestry from spain numbered 30,838 total in 2010 . people of norwegian and swedish descent both stood at about 20,000 each , while people of czech , lithuanian , portuguese , scotch-irish , and welsh descent all numbered between 12,000-14,000 people . arab americans number over 160,000 in new york city , with the highest concentration in brooklyn . central asians , primarily uzbek americans , are a rapidly growing segment of the city 's non-hispanic white population , enumerating over 30,000 , and including over half of all central asian immigrants to the united states , most settling in queens or brooklyn . albanian americans are most highly concentrated in the bronx .
one year after its publication to kill a mockingbird had been translated into ten languages . in the years since , it has sold more than 30 million copies and been translated into more than 40 languages . the novel has never been out of print in hardcover or paperback , and has become part of the standard literature curriculum . a 2008 survey of secondary books read by students between grades 9-12 in the u.s. indicates the novel is the most widely read book in these grades . a 1991 survey by the book of the month club and the library of congress center for the book found that to kill a mockingbird was rated behind only the bible in books that are " most often cited as making a difference . " [ note 1 ] it is considered by some to be the great american novel .
the war had also brought to an end the " old system " of alliances in europe , in the years after the war , under the direction of lord sandwich , the british did try to re-establish this system . but after her surprising grand success against a coalition of great powers , european states such as austria , the dutch republic , sweden , denmark-norway , ottoman empire , and russia now saw britain as a greater threat than france and did not join them , while the prussians were angered by what they considered a british betrayal in 1762 . consequently , when the american war of independence turned into a global war between 1778-83 , britain found itself opposed by a strong coalition of european powers , and lacking any substantial ally .
just as roman letters have a characteristic shape ( lower-case letters mostly occupying the x-height , with ascenders or descenders on some letters ) , chinese characters occupy a more or less square area in which the components of every character are written to fit in order to maintain a uniform size and shape , especially with small printed characters in ming and sans-serif styles . because of this , beginners often practise writing on squared graph paper , and the chinese sometimes use the term " square-block characters " ( 方块字 / 方塊字 , fangkuaizi ) , sometimes translated as tetragraph , in reference to chinese characters .
other major employers in the city include ordnance survey , the uk 's national mapping agency , whose headquarters is located in a new building on the outskirts of the city , opened in february 2011 . the lloyd 's register group has announced plans to move its london marine operations to a specially developed site at the university of southampton . the area of swaythling is home to ford 's southampton assembly plant , where the majority of their transit models are manufactured . closure of the plant in 2013 was announced in 2012 , with the loss of hundreds of jobs .
flexible or so-called " unbreakable " records made of unusual materials were introduced by a number of manufacturers at various times during the 78 rpm era . in the uk , nicole records , made of celluloid or a similar substance coated onto a cardboard core disc , were produced for a few years beginning in 1904 , but they suffered from an exceptionally high level of surface noise . in the united states , columbia records introduced flexible , fiber-cored " marconi velvet tone record " pressings in 1907 , but the advantages and longevity of their relatively noiseless surfaces depended on the scrupulous use of special gold-plated marconi needles and the product was not a success . thin , flexible plastic records such as the german phonycord and the british filmophone and goodson records appeared around 1930 but also did not last long . the contemporary french pathe cellodiscs , made of a very thin black plastic , which uncannily resembles the vinyl " sound sheet " magazine inserts of the 1965-1985 era , were similarly short-lived . in the us , hit of the week records , made of a patented translucent plastic called durium coated on a heavy brown paper base , were introduced in early 1930 . a new issue came out every week and they were sold at newsstands like a weekly magazine . although inexpensive and commercially successful at first , they soon fell victim to the great depression and production in the us ended in 1932 . related durium records continued to be made somewhat later in the uk and elsewhere , and as remarkably late as 1950 in italy , where the name " durium " survived far into the lp era as a trademark on ordinary vinyl records . despite all these attempts at innovation , shellac compounds continued to be used for the overwhelming majority of commercial 78 rpm records during the lifetime of the format .
20th century developments in plant biochemistry have been driven by modern techniques of organic chemical analysis , such as spectroscopy , chromatography and electrophoresis . with the rise of the related molecular-scale biological approaches of molecular biology , genomics , proteomics and metabolomics , the relationship between the plant genome and most aspects of the biochemistry , physiology , morphology and behaviour of plants can be subjected to detailed experimental analysis . the concept originally stated by gottlieb haberlandt in 1902 that all plant cells are totipotent and can be grown in vitro ultimately enabled the use of genetic engineering experimentally to knock out a gene or genes responsible for a specific trait , or to add genes such as gfp that report when a gene of interest is being expressed . these technologies enable the biotechnological use of whole plants or plant cell cultures grown in bioreactors to synthesise pesticides , antibiotics or other pharmaceuticals , as well as the practical application of genetically modified crops designed for traits such as improved yield .
between 1985 and 2015 , israel sent 24 delegations of idf search and rescue unit to 22 countries . in haiti , immediately following the 2010 earthquake , israel was the first country to set up a field hospital capable of performing surgical operations . israel sent over 200 medical doctors and personnel to start treating injured haitians at the scene . at the conclusion of its humanitarian mission 11 days later , the israeli delegation had treated more than 1,110 patients , conducted 319 successful surgeries , delivered 16 births and rescued or assisted in the rescue of four individuals . despite radiation concerns , israel was one of the first countries to send a medical delegation to japan following the earthquake and tsunami disaster . israel dispatched a medical team to the tsunami-stricken city of kurihara in 2011 . a medical clinic run by an idf team of some 50 members featured pediatric , surgical , maternity and gynecological , and otolaryngology wards , together with an optometry department , a laboratory , a pharmacy and an intensive care unit . after treating 200 patients in two weeks , the departing emergency team donated its equipment to the japanese .
in english , the term referring to a person first appears in the mid 14th century as catelaner , followed in the 15th century as catellain ( from french ) . it is attested a language name since at least 1652 . catalan can be pronounced as / ˈkætəlæn / , / kætəˈlæn / or / ˈkætələn / .
jehovah 's witnesses believe that jesus christ began to rule in heaven as king of god 's kingdom in october 1914 , and that satan was subsequently ousted from heaven to the earth , resulting in " woe " to humanity . they believe that jesus rules invisibly , from heaven , perceived only as a series of " signs . " they base this belief on a rendering of the greek word parousia - usually translated as " coming " when referring to christ - as " presence . " they believe jesus ' presence includes an unknown period beginning with his inauguration as king in heaven in 1914 , and ending when he comes to bring a final judgment against humans on earth . they thus depart from the mainstream christian belief that the " second coming " of matthew 24 refers to a single moment of arrival on earth to judge humans .
relaxed zoning rules and special parking privileges for churches , the tax-free status of church property , the fact that christmas is a federal holiday , etc . , have also been questioned , but have been considered examples of the governmental prerogative in deciding practical and beneficial arrangements for the society . the national motto " in god we trust " has been challenged as a violation , but the supreme court has ruled that ceremonial deism is not religious in nature . a circuit court ruling affirmed ohio 's right to use as its motto a passage from the bible , " with god , all things are possible , " because it displayed no preference for a particular religion .
in the 1920s , john maynard keynes prompted a division between microeconomics and macroeconomics . under keynesian economics macroeconomic trends can overwhelm economic choices made by individuals . governments should promote aggregate demand for goods as a means to encourage economic expansion . following world war ii , milton friedman created the concept of monetarism . monetarism focuses on using the supply and demand of money as a method for controlling economic activity . in the 1970s , monetarism has adapted into supply-side economics which advocates reducing taxes as a means to increase the amount of money available for economic expansion .
feynman alludes to his thoughts on the justification for getting involved in the manhattan project in the pleasure of finding things out . he felt the possibility of nazi germany developing the bomb before the allies was a compelling reason to help with its development for the u.s. he goes on to say that it was an error on his part not to reconsider the situation once germany was defeated . in the same publication , feynman also talks about his worries in the atomic bomb age , feeling for some considerable time that there was a high risk that the bomb would be used again soon , so that it was pointless to build for the future . later he describes this period as a " depression . "
the iso standard iso 12232 : 2006 gives digital still camera manufacturers a choice of five different techniques for determining the exposure index rating at each sensitivity setting provided by a particular camera model . three of the techniques in iso 12232 : 2006 are carried over from the 1998 version of the standard , while two new techniques allowing for measurement of jpeg output files are introduced from cipa dc-004 . depending on the technique selected , the exposure index rating can depend on the sensor sensitivity , the sensor noise , and the appearance of the resulting image . the standard specifies the measurement of light sensitivity of the entire digital camera system and not of individual components such as digital sensors , although kodak has reported using a variation to characterize the sensitivity of two of their sensors in 2001 .
according to the primary chronicle , the territories of the east slavs in the 9th century were divided between the varangians and the khazars . the varangians are first mentioned imposing tribute from slavic and finnic tribes in 859 . in 862 , the finnic and slavic tribes in the area of novgorod rebelled against the varangians , driving them " back beyond the sea and , refusing them further tribute , set out to govern themselves . " the tribes had no laws , however , and soon began to make war with one another , prompting them to invite the varangians back to rule them and bring peace to the region :
other authors have focused on the structural conditions leading up to genocide and the psychological and social processes that create an evolution toward genocide . ervin staub showed that economic deterioration and political confusion and disorganization were starting points of increasing discrimination and violence in many instances of genocides and mass killing . they lead to scapegoating a group and ideologies that identified that group as an enemy . a history of devaluation of the group that becomes the victim , past violence against the group that becomes the perpetrator leading to psychological wounds , authoritarian cultures and political systems , and the passivity of internal and external witnesses ( bystanders ) all contribute to the probability that the violence develops into genocide . intense conflict between groups that is unresolved , becomes intractable and violent can also lead to genocide . the conditions that lead to genocide provide guidance to early prevention , such as humanizing a devalued group , creating ideologies that embrace all groups , and activating bystander responses . there is substantial research to indicate how this can be done , but information is only slowly transformed into action .
in 2008 , the bbc reported that the company primark was using child labor in the manufacture of clothing . in particular , a £ 4 hand-embroidered shirt was the starting point of a documentary produced by bbc 's panorama programme . the programme asks consumers to ask themselves , " why am i only paying £ 4 for a hand embroidered top ? this item looks handmade . who made it for such little cost ? , " in addition to exposing the violent side of the child labour industry in countries where child exploitation is prevalent .
typologically , estonian represents a transitional form from an agglutinating language to a fusional language . the canonical word order is svo ( subject-verb-object ) .
a second new haven gastronomical claim to fame is louis ' lunch , which is located in a small brick building on crown street and has been serving fast food since 1895 . though fiercely debated , the restaurant 's founder louis lassen is credited by the library of congress with inventing the hamburger and steak sandwich . louis ' lunch broils hamburgers , steak sandwiches and hot dogs vertically in original antique 1898 cast iron stoves using gridirons , patented by local resident luigi pieragostini in 1939 , that hold the meat in place while it cooks .
the term mainly refers to a mix of lithium and aluminosilicates that yields an array of materials with interesting thermomechanical properties . the most commercially important of these have the distinction of being impervious to thermal shock . thus , glass-ceramics have become extremely useful for countertop cooking . the negative thermal expansion coefficient ( cte ) of the crystalline ceramic phase can be balanced with the positive cte of the glassy phase . at a certain point ( ~ 70 % crystalline ) the glass-ceramic has a net cte near zero . this type of glass-ceramic exhibits excellent mechanical properties and can sustain repeated and quick temperature changes up to 1000 ° c .

most of thailand 's institutes of technology were developed from technical colleges , in the past could not grant bachelor 's degrees ; today , however , they are university level institutions , some of which can grant degrees to the doctoral level . examples are pathumwan institute of technology ( developed from pathumwan technical school ) , king mongkut 's institute of technology ladkrabang ( nondhaburi telecommunications training centre ) , and king mongkut 's institute of technology north bangkok ( thai-german technical school ) .
aristotle noted that cranes traveled from the steppes of scythia to marshes at the headwaters of the nile . pliny the elder , in his historia naturalis , repeats aristotle 's observations .
von neumann 's famous 9-page paper started life as a talk at princeton and then became a paper in germany , which was eventually translated into english . his interest in economics that led to that paper began as follows : when lecturing at berlin in 1928 and 1929 he spent his summers back home in budapest , and so did the economist nicholas kaldor , and they hit it off . kaldor recommended that von neumann read a book by the mathematical economist leon walras . von neumann found some faults in that book and corrected them , for example , replacing equations by inequalities . he noticed that walras 's general equilibrium theory and walras ' law , which led to systems of simultaneous linear equations , could produce the absurd result that the profit could be maximized by producing and selling a negative quantity of a product . he replaced the equations by inequalities , introduced dynamic equilibria , among other things , and eventually produced the paper .
the original services of an inn are now also available at other establishments , such as hotels , lodges , and motels , which focus more on lodging customers than on other services , although they usually provide meals ; pubs , which are primarily alcohol-serving establishments ; and restaurants and taverns , which serve food and drink . in north america , the lodging aspect of the word " inn " lives on in hotel brand names like holiday inn , and in some state laws that refer to lodging operators as innkeepers .
arsenal appointed herbert chapman as manager in 1925 . having already won the league twice with huddersfield town in 1923-24 and 1924-25 ( see seasons in english football ) , chapman brought arsenal their first period of major success . his revolutionary tactics and training , along with the signings of star players such as alex james and cliff bastin , laid the foundations of the club 's domination of english football in the 1930s . under his guidance arsenal won their first major trophies - victory in the 1930 fa cup final preceded two league championships , in 1930-31 and 1932-33 . in addition , chapman was behind the 1932 renaming of the local london underground station from " gillespie road " to " arsenal , " making it the only tube station to be named specifically after a football club .
infrared tracking , also known as infrared homing , refers to a passive missile guidance system , which uses the emission from a target of electromagnetic radiation in the infrared part of the spectrum to track it . missiles that use infrared seeking are often referred to as " heat-seekers , " since infrared ( ir ) is just below the visible spectrum of light in frequency and is radiated strongly by hot bodies . many objects such as people , vehicle engines , and aircraft generate and retain heat , and as such , are especially visible in the infrared wavelengths of light compared to objects in the background .
unlike the baroque style that it replaced , which was mostly used for palaces and churches , and had little representation in the british colonies , simpler georgian styles were widely used by the upper and middle classes . perhaps the best remaining house is the pristine hammond-harwood house ( 1774 ) in annapolis , maryland , designed by the colonial architect william buckland and modelled on the villa pisani at montagnana , italy as depicted in andrea palladio 's i quattro libri dell 'architettura ( " four books of architecture " ) .
professional wrestling in the u.s. tends to have a heavy focus on story building and the establishment of characters ( and their personalities ) . there is a story for each match , and even a longer story for successive matches . the stories usually contain characters like faces and heels , and less often antiheroes and tweeners . it is a " triumph " if the face wins , while it is a " tragedy " if the heel wins . the characters usually have strong and sharp personalities , with examples like doink the clown , whose personality is melodramatic , slapstick and fantastical . the opposition between faces and heels is very intense in the story , and the heels may even attack the faces during tv interviews . the relationship between different characters can also be very complex .
in 1637 a small party of puritans reconnoitered the new haven harbor area and wintered over . in april 1638 , the main party of five hundred puritans who left the massachusetts bay colony under the leadership of the reverend john davenport and the london merchant theophilus eaton sailed into the harbor . these settlers were hoping to establish a ( in their mind ) better theological community , with the government more closely linked to the church than the one they left in massachusetts and sought to take advantage of the excellent port capabilities of the harbor . the quinnipiacs , who were under attack by neighboring pequots , sold their land to the settlers in return for protection .
on september 6 , 2006 , sony announced that pal region playstation 3 launch would be delayed until march 2007 , because of a shortage of materials used in the blu-ray drive . at the tokyo game show on september 22 , 2006 , sony announced that it would include an hdmi port on the 20 gb system , but a chrome trim , flash card readers , silver logo and wi-fi would not be included . also , the launch price of the japanese 20 gb model was reduced by over 20 % , and the 60 gb model was announced for an open pricing scheme in japan . during the event , sony showed 27 playable ps3 games running on final hardware .
in the al-burhan ( on demonstration ) section of the book of healing , avicenna discussed the philosophy of science and described an early scientific method of inquiry . he discusses aristotle 's posterior analytics and significantly diverged from it on several points . avicenna discussed the issue of a proper methodology for scientific inquiry and the question of " how does one acquire the first principles of a science ? " he asked how a scientist would arrive at " the initial axioms or hypotheses of a deductive science without inferring them from some more basic premises ? " he explains that the ideal situation is when one grasps that a " relation holds between the terms , which would allow for absolute , universal certainty . " avicenna then adds two further methods for arriving at the first principles : the ancient aristotelian method of induction ( istiqra ) , and the method of examination and experimentation ( tajriba ) . avicenna criticized aristotelian induction , arguing that " it does not lead to the absolute , universal , and certain premises that it purports to provide . " in its place , he develops a " method of experimentation as a means for scientific inquiry . "
the band had a number of bass players during this period who did not fit with the band 's chemistry . it was not until february 1971 that they settled on john deacon and began to rehearse for their first album . they recorded four of their own songs , " liar , " " keep yourself alive , " " the night comes down " and " jesus , " for a demo tape ; no record companies were interested . it was also around this time freddie changed his surname to " mercury , " inspired by the line " mother mercury , look what they 've done to me " in the song " my fairy king . " on 2 july 1971 , queen played their first show in the classic line-up of mercury , may , taylor and deacon at a surrey college outside london .
the struggle related to the constitutional movement continued until 1911 , when mohammad ali shah was defeated and forced to abdicate . on the pretext of restoring order , the russians occupied northern iran in 1911 , and maintained a military presence in the region for years to come . during world war i , the british occupied much of western iran , and fully withdrew in 1921 . the persian campaign commenced furthermore during world war i in northwestern iran after an ottoman invasion , as part of the middle eastern theatre of world war i. as a result of ottoman hostilities across the border , a large amount of the assyrians of iran were massacred by the ottoman armies , notably in and around urmia . apart from the rule of aqa mohammad khan , the qajar rule is characterized as a century of misrule .
in many people , the infection waxes and wanes . tissue destruction and necrosis are often balanced by healing and fibrosis . affected tissue is replaced by scarring and cavities filled with caseous necrotic material . during active disease , some of these cavities are joined to the air passages bronchi and this material can be coughed up . it contains living bacteria , so can spread the infection . treatment with appropriate antibiotics kills bacteria and allows healing to take place . upon cure , affected areas are eventually replaced by scar tissue .

while the concordat restored much power to the papacy , the balance of church-state relations had tilted firmly in napoleon 's favour . he selected the bishops and supervised church finances . napoleon and the pope both found the concordat useful . similar arrangements were made with the church in territories controlled by napoleon , especially italy and germany . now , napoleon could win favor with the catholics while also controlling rome in a political sense . napoleon said in april 1801 , " skillful conquerors have not got entangled with priests . they can both contain them and use them . " french children were issued a catechism that taught them to love and respect napoleon .
heart disease , cancer , obesity , and diabetes are commonly called " western " diseases because these maladies were once rarely seen in developing countries . an international study in china found some regions had virtually no cancer or heart disease , while in other areas they reflected " up to a 100-fold increase " coincident with shifts from diets that were found to be entirely plant-based to heavily animal-based , respectively . in contrast , diseases of affluence like cancer and heart disease are common throughout the developed world , including the united states . adjusted for age and exercise , large regional clusters of people in china rarely suffered from these " western " diseases possibly because their diets are rich in vegetables , fruits , and whole grains , and have little dairy and meat products . some studies show these to be , in high quantities , possible causes of some cancers . there are arguments for and against this controversial issue .
beyonce has been described as a having a wide-ranging sex appeal , with music journalist toure writing that since the release of dangerously in love , she has " become a crossover sex symbol . " offstage beyonce says that while she likes to dress sexily , her onstage dress " is absolutely for the stage .

although many species can reproduce asexually and use similar mechanisms to regenerate after severe injuries , sexual reproduction is the normal method in species whose reproduction has been studied . the minority of living polychaetes whose reproduction and lifecycles are known produce trochophore larvae , that live as plankton and then sink and metamorphose into miniature adults . oligochaetes are full hermaphrodites and produce a ring-like cocoon around their bodies , in which the eggs and hatchlings are nourished until they are ready to emerge .
alphanumeric leds are available in seven-segment , starburst and dot-matrix format . seven-segment displays handle all numbers and a limited set of letters . starburst displays can display all letters . dot-matrix displays typically use 5x7 pixels per character . seven-segment led displays were in widespread use in the 1970s and 1980s , but rising use of liquid crystal displays , with their lower power needs and greater display flexibility , has reduced the popularity of numeric and alphanumeric led displays .
throughout the following month , the yongle emperor and his court showered the karmapa with presents . at linggu temple in nanjing , he presided over the religious ceremonies for the yongle emperor 's deceased parents , while twenty-two days of his stay were marked by religious miracles that were recorded in five languages on a gigantic scroll that bore the emperor 's seal . during his stay in nanjing , deshin shekpa was bestowed the title " great treasure prince of dharma " by the yongle emperor . elliot sperling asserts that the yongle emperor , in bestowing deshin shekpa with the title of " king " and praising his mystical abilities and miracles , was trying to build an alliance with the karmapa as the mongols had with the sakya lamas , but deshin shekpa rejected the yongle emperor 's offer . in fact , this was the same title that kublai khan had offered the sakya phagpa lama , but deshin shekpa persuaded the yongle emperor to grant the title to religious leaders of other tibetan buddhist sects .
karlheinz brandenburg used a cd recording of suzanne vega 's song " tom 's diner " to assess and refine the mp3 compression algorithm . this song was chosen because of its nearly monophonic nature and wide spectral content , making it easier to hear imperfections in the compression format during playbacks . some refer to suzanne vega as " the mother of mp3 . " this particular track has an interesting property in that the two channels are almost , but not completely , the same , leading to a case where binaural masking level depression causes spatial unmasking of noise artifacts unless the encoder properly recognizes the situation and applies corrections similar to those detailed in the mpeg-2 aac psychoacoustic model . some more critical audio excerpts ( glockenspiel , triangle , accordion , etc . ) were taken from the ebu v3 / sqam reference compact disc and have been used by professional sound engineers to assess the subjective quality of the mpeg audio formats .
from the semi-finals onwards , the fate of the contestants is decided by public vote . during the contestant 's performance as well as the recap at the end , a toll-free telephone number for each contestant is displayed on the screen . for a two-hour period after the episode ends ( up to four hours for the finale ) in each us time zone , viewers may call or send a text message to their preferred contestant 's telephone number , and each call or text message is registered as a vote for that contestant . viewers are allowed to vote as many times as they can within the two-hour voting window . however , the show reserves the right to discard votes by power dialers . one or more of the least popular contestants may be eliminated in successive weeks until a winner emerges . over 110 million votes were cast in the first season , and by season ten the seasonal total had increased to nearly 750 million . voting via text messaging was made available in the second season when at & t wireless joined as a sponsor of the show , and 7.5 million text messages were sent to american idol that season . the number of text messages rapidly increased , reaching 178 million texts by season eight . online voting was offered for the first time in season ten . the votes are counted and verified by telescope inc .
the forces converged in the largest sea battle of world war ii up to that point . over the previous month american destroyers had destroyed 17 of 25 submarines out of ozawa 's screening force . repeated u.s. raids destroyed the japanese land-based planes . ozawa 's main attack lacked coordination , with the japanese planes arriving at their targets in a staggered sequence . following a directive from nimitz , the u.s. carriers all had combat information centers , which interpreted the flow of radar data and radioed interception orders to the hellcats . the result was later dubbed the great marianas turkey shoot . the few attackers to reach the u.s. fleet encountered massive aa fire with proximity fuzes . only one american warship was slightly damaged .
wilhelm erb 's ( 1874 ) " intensive " theory , that a pain signal can be generated by intense enough stimulation of any sensory receptor , has been soundly disproved . some sensory fibers do not differentiate between noxious and non-noxious stimuli , while others , nociceptors , respond only to noxious , high intensity stimuli . at the peripheral end of the nociceptor , noxious stimuli generate currents that , above a given threshold , begin to send signals along the nerve fiber to the spinal cord . the " specificity " ( whether it responds to thermal , chemical or mechanical features of its environment ) of a nociceptor is determined by which ion channels it expresses at its peripheral end . dozens of different types of nociceptor ion channels have so far been identified , and their exact functions are still being determined .
humanists reacted against this utilitarian approach and the narrow pedantry associated with it . they sought to create a citizenry ( frequently including women ) able to speak and write with eloquence and clarity and thus capable of engaging the civic life of their communities and persuading others to virtuous and prudent actions . this was to be accomplished through the study of the studia humanitatis , today known as the humanities : grammar , rhetoric , history , poetry and moral philosophy . as a program to revive the cultural - and particularly the literary - legacy and moral philosophy of classical antiquity , humanism was a pervasive cultural mode and not the program of a few isolated geniuses like rabelais or erasmus as is still sometimes popularly believed .
one of the characteristics of byu most often pointed out is its reputation for emphasizing a " marriage culture . " members of the church of jesus christ of latter-day saints highly value marriage and family , especially marriage within the faith . approximately 51 percent of the graduates in byu 's class of 2005 were married . this is compared to a national marriage average among college graduates of 11 percent . byu students on average marry at the age of 22 , according to a 2005 study , while the national average age is 25 years for men and 27 years for women .
the principles of phonological analysis can be applied independently of modality because they are designed to serve as general analytical tools , not language-specific ones . the same principles have been applied to the analysis of sign languages ( see phonemes in sign languages ) , even though the sub-lexical units are not instantiated as speech sounds .
according to this narrative , shortly after the birth of young prince gautama , an astrologer named asita visited the young prince 's father , suddhodana , and prophesied that siddhartha would either become a great king or renounce the material world to become a holy man , depending on whether he saw what life was like outside the palace walls .
after dna replication is complete , the cell must physically separate the two copies of the genome and divide into two distinct membrane-bound cells . : 18.2 in prokaryotes ( bacteria and archaea ) this usually occurs via a relatively simple process called binary fission , in which each circular genome attaches to the cell membrane and is separated into the daughter cells as the membrane invaginates to split the cytoplasm into two membrane-bound portions . binary fission is extremely fast compared to the rates of cell division in eukaryotes . eukaryotic cell division is a more complex process known as the cell cycle ; dna replication occurs during a phase of this cycle known as s phase , whereas the process of segregating chromosomes and splitting the cytoplasm occurs during m phase . : 18.1
at the end of the third quarter in 2008 , florida had the highest mortgage delinquency rate in the country , with 7.8 % of mortgages delinquent at least 60 days . a 2009 list of national housing markets that were hard hit in the real estate crash included a disproportionate number in florida . the early 21st-century building boom left florida with 300,000 vacant homes in 2009 , according to state figures . in 2009 , the us census bureau estimated that floridians spent an average 49.1 % of personal income on housing-related costs , the third highest percentage in the country .
harper lee was pleased with the movie , saying : " in that film the man and the part met ... i 've had many , many offers to turn it into musicals , into tv or stage plays , but i 've always refused . that film was a work of art . " peck met lee 's father , the model for atticus , before the filming . lee 's father died before the film 's release , and lee was so impressed with peck 's performance that she gave him her father 's pocketwatch , which he had with him the evening he was awarded the oscar for best actor . years later , he was reluctant to tell lee that the watch was stolen out of his luggage in london heathrow airport . when peck eventually did tell lee , he said she responded , " ' well , it 's only a watch . ' harper - she feels deeply , but she 's not a sentimental person about things . " lee and peck shared a friendship long after the movie was made . peck 's grandson was named " harper " in her honor .
arsenal 's parent company , arsenal holdings plc , operates as a non-quoted public limited company , whose ownership is considerably different from that of other football clubs . only 62,217 shares in arsenal have been issued , and they are not traded on a public exchange such as the ftse or aim ; instead , they are traded relatively infrequently on the icap securities and derivatives exchange , a specialist market . on 10 march 2016 , a single share in arsenal had a mid price of £ 15,670 , which sets the club 's market capitalisation value at approximately £ 975m . most football clubs aren 't listed on an exchange , which makes direct comparisons of their values difficult . business magazine forbes valued arsenal as a whole at $ 1.3 billion in 2015 . consultants brand finance valued the club 's brand and intangible assets at $ 703m in 2015 , and consider arsenal an aaa global brand . research by the henley business school modelled the club 's value at £ 1.118 billion in 2015 , the second highest in the premier league .

chopin 's successes as a composer and performer opened the door to western europe for him , and on 2 november 1830 , he set out , in the words of zdzisław jachimecki , " into the wide world , with no very clearly defined aim , forever . " with woyciechowski , he headed for austria , intending to go on to italy . later that month , in warsaw , the november 1830 uprising broke out , and woyciechowski returned to poland to enlist . chopin , now alone in vienna , was nostalgic for his homeland , and wrote to a friend , " i curse the moment of my departure . " when in september 1831 he learned , while travelling from vienna to paris , that the uprising had been crushed , he expressed his anguish in the pages of his private journal : " oh god ! ... you are there , and yet you do not take vengeance ! " jachimecki ascribes to these events the composer 's maturing " into an inspired national bard who intuited the past , present and future of his native poland . "
in soil , microorganisms that reside in the rhizosphere ( a zone that includes the root surface and the soil that adheres to the root after gentle shaking ) carry out nitrogen fixation , converting nitrogen gas to nitrogenous compounds . this serves to provide an easily absorbable form of nitrogen for many plants , which cannot fix nitrogen themselves . many other bacteria are found as symbionts in humans and other organisms . for example , the presence of over 1,000 bacterial species in the normal human gut flora of the intestines can contribute to gut immunity , synthesise vitamins , such as folic acid , vitamin k and biotin , convert sugars to lactic acid ( see lactobacillus ) , as well as fermenting complex undigestible carbohydrates . the presence of this gut flora also inhibits the growth of potentially pathogenic bacteria ( usually through competitive exclusion ) and these beneficial bacteria are consequently sold as probiotic dietary supplements .
another who contributed significantly to the spirituality of the order is albertus magnus , the only person of the period to be given the appellation " great . " his influence on the brotherhood permeated nearly every aspect of dominican life . albert was a scientist , philosopher , astrologer , theologian , spiritual writer , ecumenist , and diplomat . under the auspices of humbert of romans , albert molded the curriculum of studies for all dominican students , introduced aristotle to the classroom and probed the work of neoplatonists , such as plotinus . indeed , it was the thirty years of work done by thomas aquinas and himself ( 1245-1274 ) that allowed for the inclusion of aristotelian study in the curriculum of dominican schools .
malian musical traditions are derived from the griots , who are known as " keepers of memories . " malian music is diverse and has several different genres . some famous malian influences in music are kora virtuoso musician toumani diabate , the late roots and blues guitarist ali farka toure , the tuareg band tinariwen , and several afro-pop artists such as salif keita , the duo amadou et mariam , oumou sangare , and habib koite . dance also plays a large role in malian culture . dance parties are common events among friends , and traditional mask dances are performed at ceremonial events .
another study on men and women 's patterns of sexual arousal confirmed that men and women have different patterns of arousal , independent of their sexual orientations . the study found that women 's genitals become aroused to both human and nonhuman stimuli from movies showing humans of both genders having sex ( heterosexual and homosexual ) and from videos showing non-human primates ( bonobos ) having sex . men did not show any sexual arousal to non-human visual stimuli , their arousal patterns being in line with their specific sexual interest ( women for heterosexual men and men for homosexual men ) .
color in glass may be obtained by addition of electrically charged ions ( or color centers ) that are homogeneously distributed , and by precipitation of finely dispersed particles ( such as in photochromic glasses ) . ordinary soda-lime glass appears colorless to the naked eye when it is thin , although iron ( ii ) oxide ( feo ) impurities of up to 0.1 wt % produce a green tint , which can be viewed in thick pieces or with the aid of scientific instruments . further feo and cr2o3 additions may be used for the production of green bottles . sulfur , together with carbon and iron salts , is used to form iron polysulfides and produce amber glass ranging from yellowish to almost black . a glass melt can also acquire an amber color from a reducing combustion atmosphere . manganese dioxide can be added in small amounts to remove the green tint given by iron ( ii ) oxide . when used in art glass or studio glass is colored using closely guarded recipes that involve specific combinations of metal oxides , melting temperatures and ' cook ' times . most colored glass used in the art market is manufactured in volume by vendors who serve this market although there are some glassmakers with the ability to make their own color from raw materials .
the great plains is the broad expanse of flat land ( a plain ) , much of it covered in prairie , steppe and grassland , that lies west of the mississippi river tallgrass prairie states and east of the rocky mountains in the united states and canada . this area covers parts , but not all , of the states of colorado , kansas , montana , nebraska , new mexico , north dakota , oklahoma , south dakota , texas , and wyoming , and the canadian provinces of alberta , manitoba and saskatchewan . the region is known for supporting extensive cattle ranching and dry farming .

the first step , where the wort is prepared by mixing the starch source ( normally malted barley ) with hot water , is known as " mashing . " hot water ( known as " liquor " in brewing terms ) is mixed with crushed malt or malts ( known as " grist " ) in a mash tun . the mashing process takes around 1 to 2 hours , during which the starches are converted to sugars , and then the sweet wort is drained off the grains . the grains are now washed in a process known as " sparging . " this washing allows the brewer to gather as much of the fermentable liquid from the grains as possible . the process of filtering the spent grain from the wort and sparge water is called wort separation . the traditional process for wort separation is lautering , in which the grain bed itself serves as the filter medium . some modern breweries prefer the use of filter frames which allow a more finely ground grist .
because of the sudden loss of the new orleans franchise , the league announced in october that the beginning of the free agency period would be delayed in order to accommodate a dispersal draft . dates were eventually announced as december 2 for the dispersal draft and december 4 for free agency , but shortly before the draft the league issued a press release announcing the draft had been postponed one day to december 3 . shortly thereafter , another press release announced that the draft would be held on december 9 and free agency would commence on december 11 . however , the draft still never took place , and instead another press release was issued stating that both the draft and free agency had been postponed indefinitely . rumors began circulating that the league was in trouble and on the verge of folding , but owners denied those claims . it was soon revealed the players ' union had agreed to cut the salary cap for the 2009 season to prevent a total cessation of operations . however , the announced platinum equity investment never materialized .

market strategist phil dow believes distinctions exist " between the current market malaise " and the great depression . he says the dow jones average 's fall of more than 50 % over a period of 17 months is similar to a 54.7 % fall in the great depression , followed by a total drop of 89 % over the following 16 months . " it 's very troubling if you have a mirror image , " said dow . floyd norris , the chief financial correspondent of the new york times , wrote in a blog entry in march 2009 that the decline has not been a mirror image of the great depression , explaining that although the decline amounts were nearly the same at the time , the rates of decline had started much faster in 2007 , and that the past year had only ranked eighth among the worst recorded years of percentage drops in the dow . the past two years ranked third , however .

at the start of a classic valley glacier is a bowl-shaped cirque , which has escarped walls on three sides but is open on the side that descends into the valley . cirques are where ice begins to accumulate in a glacier . two glacial cirques may form back to back and erode their backwalls until only a narrow ridge , called an arete is left . this structure may result in a mountain pass . if multiple cirques encircle a single mountain , they create pointed pyramidal peaks ; particularly steep examples are called horns .
von neumann 's principal contribution to the atomic bomb was in the concept and design of the explosive lenses needed to compress the plutonium core of the fat man weapon that was later dropped on nagasaki . while von neumann did not originate the " implosion " concept , he was one of its most persistent proponents , encouraging its continued development against the instincts of many of his colleagues , who felt such a design to be unworkable . he also eventually came up with the idea of using more powerful shaped charges and less fissionable material to greatly increase the speed of " assembly . "
nasser was greatly influenced by egyptian nationalism , as espoused by politician mustafa kamel , poet ahmed shawqi , and his anti-colonialist instructor at the royal military academy , aziz al-masri , to whom nasser expressed his gratitude in a 1961 newspaper interview . he was especially influenced by egyptian writer tawfiq al-hakim 's novel return of the spirit , in which al-hakim wrote that the egyptian people were only in need of a " man in whom all their feelings and desires will be represented , and who will be for them a symbol of their objective . " nasser later credited the novel as his inspiration to launch the 1952 revolution .

the international association for the study of pain advocates that the relief of pain should be recognized as a human right , that chronic pain should be considered a disease in its own right , and that pain medicine should have the full status of a specialty . it is a specialty only in china and australia at this time . elsewhere , pain medicine is a subspecialty under disciplines such as anesthesiology , physiatry , neurology , palliative medicine and psychiatry . in 2011 , human rights watch alerted that tens of millions of people worldwide are still denied access to inexpensive medications for severe pain .
since the 2010 election , the government has embarked on a series of reforms to direct the country towards liberal democracy , a mixed economy , and reconciliation , although doubts persist about the motives that underpin such reforms . the series of reforms includes the release of pro-democracy leader aung san suu kyi from house arrest , the establishment of the national human rights commission , the granting of general amnesties for more than 200 political prisoners , new labour laws that permit labour unions and strikes , a relaxation of press censorship , and the regulation of currency practices .
in 1941 , reza shah was forced to abdicate in favor of his son , mohammad reza pahlavi , and established the persian corridor , a massive supply route that would last until the end of the ongoing war . the presence of so many foreign troops in the nation also culminated in the soviet-backed establishment of two puppet regimes in the nation ; the azerbaijan people 's government , and the republic of mahabad . as the soviet union refused to relinquish the occupied iranian territory , the iran crisis of 1946 was followed , which particularly resulted in the dissolution of both puppet states , and the withdrawal of the soviets .
the soviet union created the eastern bloc of countries that it occupied , annexing some as soviet socialist republics and maintaining others as satellite states that would later form the warsaw pact . the united states and various western european countries began a policy of " containment " of communism and forged myriad alliances to this end , including nato . several of these western countries also coordinated efforts regarding the rebuilding of western europe , including western germany , which the soviets opposed . in other regions of the world , such as latin america and southeast asia , the soviet union fostered communist revolutionary movements , which the united states and many of its allies opposed and , in some cases , attempted to " roll back . " many countries were prompted to align themselves with the nations that would later form either nato or the warsaw pact , though other movements would also emerge .
polytechnics were tertiary education teaching institutions in england , wales and northern ireland . since 1970 uk polytechnics operated under the binary system of education along with universities . polytechnics offered diplomas and degrees ( bachelor 's , master 's , phd ) validated at the national level by the uk council for national academic awards cnaa . they particularly excelled in engineering and applied science degree courses similar to technological universities in the usa and continental europe . the comparable institutions in scotland were collectively referred to as central institutions . britain 's first polytechnic , the royal polytechnic institution later known as the polytechnic of central london ( now the university of westminster ) was established in 1838 at regent street in london and its goal was to educate and popularize engineering and scientific knowledge and inventions in victorian britain " at little expense . " the london polytechnic led a mass movement to create numerous polytechnic institutes across the uk in the late 19th century . most polytechnic institutes were established at the centre of major metropolitan cities and their focus was on engineering , applied science and technology education .
described as being " sexy , seductive and provocative " when performing on stage , beyonce has said that she originally created the alter ego " sasha fierce " to keep that stage persona separate from who she really is . she described sasha as being " too aggressive , too strong , too sassy [ and ] too sexy , " stating , " i 'm not like her in real life at all . " sasha was conceived during the making of " crazy in love , " and beyonce introduced her with the release of her 2008 album i am ... sasha fierce . in february 2010 , she announced in an interview with allure magazine that she was comfortable enough with herself to no longer need sasha fierce . however , beyonce announced in may 2012 that she would bring her back for her revel presents : beyonce live shows later that month .
perceived quality can be influenced by listening environment ( ambient noise ) , listener attention , and listener training and in most cases by listener audio equipment ( such as sound cards , speakers and headphones ) .
to make pulp from wood , a chemical pulping process separates lignin from cellulose fibres . this is accomplished by dissolving lignin in a cooking liquor , so that it may be washed from the cellulose ; this preserves the length of the cellulose fibres . paper made from chemical pulps are also known as wood-free papers-not to be confused with tree-free paper ; this is because they do not contain lignin , which deteriorates over time . the pulp can also be bleached to produce white paper , but this consumes 5 % of the fibres ; chemical pulping processes are not used to make paper made from cotton , which is already 90 % cellulose .
feynman alludes to his thoughts on the justification for getting involved in the manhattan project in the pleasure of finding things out . he felt the possibility of nazi germany developing the bomb before the allies was a compelling reason to help with its development for the u.s. he goes on to say that it was an error on his part not to reconsider the situation once germany was defeated . in the same publication , feynman also talks about his worries in the atomic bomb age , feeling for some considerable time that there was a high risk that the bomb would be used again soon , so that it was pointless to build for the future . later he describes this period as a " depression . "
robert of ketton 's 1143 translation of the quran for peter the venerable , lex mahumet pseudoprophete , was the first into a western language ( latin ) . alexander ross offered the first english version in 1649 , from the french translation of l 'alcoran de mahomet ( 1647 ) by andre du ryer . in 1734 , george sale produced the first scholarly translation of the quran into english ; another was produced by richard bell in 1937 , and yet another by arthur john arberry in 1955 . all these translators were non-muslims . there have been numerous translations by muslims . the ahmadiyya muslim community has published translations of the quran in 50 different languages besides a five-volume english commentary and an english translation of the quran .
in response to the criticism of the kinsey scale only measuring two dimensions of sexual orientation , fritz klein developed the klein sexual orientation grid ( ksog ) , a multidimensional scale for describing sexual orientation . introduced in klein 's book the bisexual option , the ksog uses a 7-point scale to assess seven different dimensions of sexuality at three different points in an individual 's life : past ( from early adolescence up to one year ago ) , present ( within the last 12 months ) , and ideal ( what would you choose if it were completely your choice ) .
the afl currently runs as under the single-entity model , with the league owning the rights to the teams , players , and coaches . the single-entity model was adopted in 2010 when the league emerged from bankruptcy . prior to that , the league followed the franchise model more common in north american professional sports leagues ; each team essentially operated as its own business and the league itself was a separate entity which in exchange for franchise fees paid by the team owners provided rules , officials , scheduling and the other elements of organizational structure . a pool of money is allotted to teams to aid in travel costs .
there have been instances where a country 's government bans a movie , resulting in the spread of copied videos and dvds . romanian-born documentary maker ilinca calugareanu wrote a new york times article telling the story of irina margareta nistor , a narrator for state tv under nicolae ceausescu 's regime . a visitor from the west gave her bootlegged copies of american movies , which she dubbed for secret viewings through romania . according to the article , she dubbed more than 3,000 movies and became the country 's second-most famous voice after ceausescu , even though no one knew her name until many years later .

the tuvaluan language and english are the national languages of tuvalu . tuvaluan is of the ellicean group of polynesian languages , distantly related to all other polynesian languages such as hawaiian , maori , tahitian , samoan and tongan . it is most closely related to the languages spoken on the polynesian outliers in micronesia and northern and central melanesia . the language has borrowed from the samoan language , as a consequence of christian missionaries in the late 19th and early 20th centuries being predominantly samoan .
though researchers generally believe that sexual orientation is not determined by any one factor but by a combination of genetic , hormonal , and environmental influences , with biological factors involving a complex interplay of genetic factors and the early uterine environment , they favor biological models for the cause . they believe that sexual orientation is not a choice , and some of them believe that it is established at conception . that is , individuals do not choose to be homosexual , heterosexual , bisexual , or asexual . while current scientific investigation usually seeks to find biological explanations for the adoption of a particular sexual orientation , there are yet no replicated scientific studies supporting any specific biological etiology for sexual orientation . however , scientific studies have found a number of statistical biological differences between gay people and heterosexuals , which may result from the same underlying cause as sexual orientation itself .
the parliamentary elections of 2005 aroused many accusations from opposition parties and international observers that president emomalii rahmon corruptly manipulates the election process and unemployment . the most recent elections , in february 2010 , saw the ruling pdpt lose four seats in parliament , yet still maintain a comfortable majority . the organization for security and co-operation in europe election observers said the 2010 polling " failed to meet many key osce commitments " and that " these elections failed on many basic democratic standards . " the government insisted that only minor violations had occurred , which would not affect the will of the tajik people .
with the end of the war with japan , the chinese civil war resumed between the chinese communists and the chinese nationalists . while the communists were struggling for supremacy in manchuria , they were supported by the north korean government with materiel and manpower . according to chinese sources , the north koreans donated 2,000 railway cars worth of materiel while thousands of koreans served in the chinese people 's liberation army ( pla ) during the war . north korea also provided the chinese communists in manchuria with a safe refuge for non-combatants and communications with the rest of china .
asphalt / bitumen is typically stored and transported at temperatures around 150 ° c ( 302 ° f ) . sometimes diesel oil or kerosene are mixed in before shipping to retain liquidity ; upon delivery , these lighter materials are separated out of the mixture . this mixture is often called " bitumen feedstock , " or bfs . some dump trucks route the hot engine exhaust through pipes in the dump body to keep the material warm . the backs of tippers carrying asphalt / bitumen , as well as some handling equipment , are also commonly sprayed with a releasing agent before filling to aid release . diesel oil is no longer used as a release agent due to environmental concerns .
in december , beyonce along with a variety of other celebrities teamed up and produced a video campaign for " demand a plan , " a bipartisan effort by a group of 950 us mayors and others designed to influence the federal government into rethinking its gun control laws , following the sandy hook elementary school shooting . beyonce became an ambassador for the 2012 world humanitarian day campaign donating her song " i was here " and its music video , shot in the un , to the campaign . in 2013 , it was announced that beyonce would work with salma hayek and frida giannini on a gucci " chime for change " campaign that aims to spread female empowerment . the campaign , which aired on february 28 , was set to her new music . a concert for the cause took place on june 1 , 2013 in london and included other acts like ellie goulding , florence and the machine , and rita ora . in advance of the concert , she appeared in a campaign video released on 15 may 2013 , where she , along with cameron diaz , john legend and kylie minogue , described inspiration from their mothers , while a number of other artists celebrated personal inspiration from other women , leading to a call for submission of photos of women of viewers ' inspiration from which a selection was shown at the concert . beyonce said about her mother tina knowles that her gift was " finding the best qualities in every human being . " with help of the crowdfunding platform catapult , visitors of the concert could choose between several projects promoting education of women and girls . beyonce is also taking part in " miss a meal , " a food-donation campaign , and supporting goodwill charity through online charity auctions at charitybuzz that support job creation throughout europe and the u.s .
during this early period , it was more usual that neither major party grouping ( federalists and democratic-republicans ) had an official leader . in 1813 , for instance , a scholar recounts that the federalist minority of 36 members needed a committee of 13 " to represent a party comprising a distinct minority " and " to coordinate the actions of men who were already partisans in the same cause . " in 1828 , a foreign observer of the house offered this perspective on the absence of formal party leadership on capitol hill :
it now became relevant to define the east of the eastern question . in about the middle of the 19th century " near east " came into use to describe that part of the east closest to europe . the term " far east " appeared contemporaneously meaning japan , china , korea , indonesia and viet nam ; in short , the east indies . " near east " applied to what had been mainly known as the levant , which was in the jurisdiction of the ottoman porte , or government . those who used the term had little choice about its meaning . they could not set foot on most of the shores of the southern and central mediterranean from the gulf of sidra to albania without permits from the ottoman empire .
bell began a series of public demonstrations and lectures to introduce the new invention to the scientific community as well as the general public . a short time later , his demonstration of an early telephone prototype at the 1876 centennial exposition in philadelphia brought the telephone to international attention . influential visitors to the exhibition included emperor pedro ii of brazil . later bell had the opportunity to demonstrate the invention personally to sir william thomson ( later , lord kelvin ) , a renowned scottish scientist , as well as to queen victoria , who had requested a private audience at osborne house , her isle of wight home . she called the demonstration " most extraordinary . " the enthusiasm surrounding bell 's public displays laid the groundwork for universal acceptance of the revolutionary device .
the nfl network ceased airing arena football league games partway through the 2012 season as a result of ongoing labor problems within the league . briefly , the games were broadcast on a tape delay to prevent the embarrassment that would result should the players stage a work stoppage immediately prior to a scheduled broadcast . ( in at least once incidence this actually happened , resulting in a non-competitive game being played with replacement players , and further such incidents were threatened . ) once the labor issues were resolved , the nfl network resumed the practice of broadcasting a live friday night game . nfl network dropped the league at the end of the 2012 season .

on the morning of 11 september 2001 , 19 men affiliated with al-qaeda hijacked four airliners all bound for california . once the hijackers assumed control of the airliners , they told the passengers that they had the bomb on board and would spare the lives of passengers and crew once their demands were met - no passenger and crew actually suspected that they would use the airliners as suicide weapons since it had never happened before in history . the hijackers - members of al-qaeda 's hamburg cell - intentionally crashed two airliners into the twin towers of the world trade center in new york city . both buildings collapsed within two hours from fire damage related to the crashes , destroying nearby buildings and damaging others . the hijackers crashed a third airliner into the pentagon in arlington county , virginia , just outside washington d.c. the fourth plane crashed into a field near shanksville , pennsylvania , after some of its passengers and flight crew attempted to retake control of the plane , which the hijackers had redirected toward washington d.c. , to target the white house , or the u.s. capitol . no flights had survivors . a total of 2,977 victims and the 19 hijackers perished in the attacks .
other cities with a concentration of secular gothic include bruges and siena . most surviving small secular buildings are relatively plain and straightforward ; most windows are flat-topped with mullions , with pointed arches and vaulted ceilings often only found at a few focal points . the country-houses of the nobility were slow to abandon the appearance of being a castle , even in parts of europe , like england , where defence had ceased to be a real concern . the living and working parts of many monastic buildings survive , for example at mont saint-michel .
the city of tucson , pima county , the state of arizona , and the private sector have all made commitments to create a growing , healthy economy [ citation needed ] with advanced technology industry sectors as its foundation . raytheon missile systems ( formerly hughes aircraft co . ) , texas instruments , ibm , intuit inc . , universal avionics , honeywell aerospace , sunquest information systems , sanofi-aventis , ventana medical systems , inc . , and bombardier aerospace all have a significant presence in tucson . roughly 150 tucson companies are involved in the design and manufacture of optics and optoelectronics systems , earning tucson the nickname " optics valley .

there are also three deputy chiefs of the defence staff with particular remits , deputy chief of the defence staff ( capability ) , deputy cds ( personnel and training ) and deputy cds ( operations ) . the surgeon general , represents the defence medical services on the defence staff , and is the clinical head of that service .
in the dicotyledons , the bundles in the very young stem are arranged in an open ring , separating a central pith from an outer cortex . in each bundle , separating the xylem and phloem , is a layer of meristem or active formative tissue known as cambium . by the formation of a layer of cambium between the bundles ( interfascicular cambium ) , a complete ring is formed , and a regular periodical increase in thickness results from the development of xylem on the inside and phloem on the outside . the soft phloem becomes crushed , but the hard wood persists and forms the bulk of the stem and branches of the woody perennial . owing to differences in the character of the elements produced at the beginning and end of the season , the wood is marked out in transverse section into concentric rings , one for each season of growth , called annual rings .
the story of the kelly gang , the world 's first feature film , was shot in melbourne in 1906 . melbourne filmmakers continued to produce bushranger films until they were banned by victorian politicians in 1912 for the perceived promotion of crime , thus contributing to the decline of one of the silent film era 's most productive industries . a notable film shot and set in melbourne during australia 's cinematic lull is on the beach ( 1959 ) . the 1970s saw the rise of the australian new wave and its ozploitation offshoot , instigated by melbourne-based productions stork and alvin purple . picnic at hanging rock and mad max , both shot in and around melbourne , achieved worldwide acclaim . 2004 saw the construction of melbourne 's largest film and television studio complex , docklands studios melbourne , which has hosted many domestic productions , as well as international features . melbourne is also home to the headquarters of village roadshow pictures , australia 's largest film production company . famous modern day actors from melbourne include cate blanchett , rachel griffiths , guy pearce , geoffrey rush and eric bana .
while inert gas reduces filament evaporation , it also conducts heat from the filament , thereby cooling the filament and reducing efficiency . at constant pressure and temperature , the thermal conductivity of a gas depends upon the molecular weight of the gas and the cross sectional area of the gas molecules . higher molecular weight gasses have lower thermal conductivity , because both the molecular weight is higher and also the cross sectional area is higher . xenon gas improves efficiency because of its high molecular weight , but is also more expensive , so its use is limited to smaller lamps .
other platings used are osp ( organic surface protectant ) , immersion silver ( iag ) , immersion tin , electroless nickel with immersion gold coating ( enig ) , electroless nickel electroless palladium immersion gold ( enepig ) and direct gold plating ( over nickel ) . edge connectors , placed along one edge of some boards , are often nickel plated then gold plated . another coating consideration is rapid diffusion of coating metal into tin solder . tin forms intermetallics such as cu5sn6 and ag3cu that dissolve into the tin liquidus or solidus ( @ 50c ) , stripping surface coating or leaving voids .
in march 2007 there were 120,305 jobs in southampton , and 3,570 people claiming job seeker 's allowance , approximately 2.4 per cent of the city 's population . this compares with an average of 2.5 per cent for england as a whole .
as the economy and the middle class expanded , there was an increasing number of amateur musicians . one manifestation of this involved women , who became more involved with music on a social level . women were already engaged in professional roles as singers , and increased their presence in the amateur performers ' scene , especially with keyboard music . music publishers begin to print music that amateurs could understand and play . the majority of the works that were published were for keyboard , voice and keyboard , and chamber ensemble . after these initial genres were popularized , from the mid-century on , amateur groups sang choral music , which then became a new trend for publishers to capitalize on . the increasing study of the fine arts , as well as access to amateur-friendly published works , led to more people becoming interested in reading and discussing music . music magazines , reviews , and critical works which suited amateurs as well as connoisseurs began to surface .
of the estimated 8.8 million jews living in europe at the beginning of world war ii , the majority of whom were ashkenazi , about 6 million - more than two-thirds - were systematically murdered in the holocaust . these included 3 million of 3.3 million polish jews ( 91 % ) ; 900,000 of 1.5 million in ukraine ( 60 % ) ; and 50-90 % of the jews of other slavic nations , germany , hungary , and the baltic states , and over 25 % of the jews in france . sephardi communities suffered similar depletions in a few countries , including greece , the netherlands and the former yugoslavia . as the large majority of the victims were ashkenazi jews , their percentage dropped from nearly 92 % of world jewry in 1931 to nearly 80 % of world jewry today . the holocaust also effectively put an end to the dynamic development of the yiddish language in the previous decades , as the vast majority of the jewish victims of the holocaust , around 5 million , were yiddish speakers . many of the surviving ashkenazi jews emigrated to countries such as israel , canada , argentina , australia , and the united states after the war .
manhattan island is linked to new york city 's outer boroughs and new jersey by several tunnels as well . the lincoln tunnel , which carries 120,000 vehicles a day under the hudson river between new jersey and midtown manhattan , is the busiest vehicular tunnel in the world . the tunnel was built instead of a bridge to allow unfettered passage of large passenger and cargo ships that sailed through new york harbor and up the hudson river to manhattan 's piers . the holland tunnel , connecting lower manhattan to jersey city , new jersey , was the world 's first mechanically ventilated vehicular tunnel when it opened in 1927 . the queens-midtown tunnel , built to relieve congestion on the bridges connecting manhattan with queens and brooklyn , was the largest non-federal project in its time when it was completed in 1940 . president franklin d. roosevelt was the first person to drive through it . the hugh l. carey tunnel runs underneath battery park and connects the financial district at the southern tip of manhattan to red hook in brooklyn .
lewis latimer , employed at the time by edison , developed an improved method of heat-treating carbon filaments which reduced breakage and allowed them to be molded into novel shapes , such as the characteristic " m " shape of maxim filaments . on 17 january 1882 , latimer received a patent for the " process of manufacturing carbons , " an improved method for the production of light bulb filaments , which was purchased by the united states electric light company . latimer patented other improvements such as a better way of attaching filaments to their wire supports .
czech , the official language of the czech republic ( a member of the european union since 2004 ) , is one of the eu 's official languages and the 2012 eurobarometer survey found that czech was the foreign language most often used in slovakia . economist jonathan van parys collected data on language knowledge in europe for the 2012 european day of languages . the five countries with the greatest use of czech were the czech republic ( 98.77 percent ) , slovakia ( 24.86 percent ) , portugal ( 1.93 percent ) , poland ( 0.98 percent ) and germany ( 0.47 percent ) .

on 9 february 2014 , swiss voters narrowly approved by 50.3 % a ballot initiative launched by the national conservative swiss people 's party ( svp / udc ) to restrict immigration , and thus reintroducing a quota system on the influx of foreigners . this initiative was mostly backed by rural ( 57.6 % approvals ) , suburban ( 51.2 % approvals ) , and isolated cities ( 51.3 % approvals ) of switzerland as well as by a strong majority ( 69.2 % approval ) in the canton of ticino , while metropolitan centres ( 58.5 % rejection ) and the french-speaking part ( 58.5 % rejection ) of switzerland rather rejected it . some news commentators claim that this proposal de facto contradicts the bilateral agreements on the free movement of persons from these respective countries .
it was not until the end of the eighteenth century that migration as an explanation for the winter disappearance of birds from northern climes was accepted . thomas bewick 's a history of british birds ( volume 1 , 1797 ) mentions a report from " a very intelligent master of a vessel " who , " between the islands of minorca and majorca , saw great numbers of swallows flying northward , " and states the situation in britain as follows :
west 's controversial incident the following year at the 2009 mtv video music awards was arguably his biggest controversy , and led to widespread outrage throughout the music industry . during the ceremony , west crashed the stage and grabbed the microphone from winner taylor swift in order to proclaim that , instead , beyonce 's video for " single ladies ( put a ring on it ) , " nominated for the same award , was " one of the best videos of all time . " he was subsequently withdrawn from the remainder of the show for his actions . west 's tour with lady gaga was cancelled in response to the controversy , and it was suggested that the incident was partially responsible for 808s & heartbreak 's lack of nominations at the 52nd grammy awards .
football is the most popular sport in portugal . there are several football competitions ranging from local amateur to world-class professional level . the legendary eusebio is still a major symbol of portuguese football history . fifa world player of the year winners luis figo and cristiano ronaldo who won the fifa ballon d 'or for 2013 and 2014 , are among the numerous examples of other world-class football players born in portugal and noted worldwide . portuguese football managers are also noteworthy , with jose mourinho , andre villas-boas , fernando santos , carlos queiroz and manuel jose among the most renowned .
from the late 10th to late 7th centuries bc , the iranian peoples , together with the pre-iranian kingdoms , fell under the domination of the assyrian empire , based in northern mesopotamia . under king cyaxares , the medes and persians entered into an alliance with nabopolassar of babylon , as well as the scythians and the cimmerians , and together they attacked the assyrian empire . the civil war ravaged the assyrian empire between 616 bc and 605 bc , thus freeing their respective peoples from three centuries of assyrian rule . the unification of the median tribes under a single ruler in 728 bc led to the foundation of the median empire which , by 612 bc , controlled the whole iran and the eastern anatolia . this marked the end of the kingdom of urartu as well , which was subsequently conquered and dissolved .
however , it is important to understand that despite the presence of reception statutes , much of contemporary american common law has diverged significantly from english common law . the reason is that although the courts of the various commonwealth nations are often influenced by each other 's rulings , american courts rarely follow post-revolution commonwealth rulings unless there is no american ruling on point , the facts and law at issue are nearly identical , and the reasoning is strongly persuasive .
chinese officials canceled the torch relay ceremony amidst disruptions , including a tibetan flag flown from a window in the city hall by green party officials . the third torchbearer in the paris leg , jin jing , who was disabled and carried the torch on a wheelchair , was assaulted several times by unidentified protestors seemingly from the pro-tibet independent camp . in interviews , jin jing said that she was " tugged at , scratched " and " kicked , " but that she " did not feel the pain at the time . " she received praise from ethnic chinese worldwide as " angel in wheelchair . " the chinese government gave the comment that " the chinese respect france a lot " but " paris [ has slapped ] its own face . "

on june 25 , 2006 , warren buffett ( then the world 's richest person , estimated worth of us $ 62 billion as of april 16 , 2008 ) pledged to give the foundation approximately 10 million berkshire hathaway class b shares spread over multiple years through annual contributions , with the first year 's donation of 500,000 shares being worth approximately us $ 1.5 billion . buffett set conditions so that these contributions do not simply increase the foundation 's endowment , but effectively work as a matching contribution , doubling the foundation 's annual giving : " buffett 's gift came with three conditions for the gates foundation : bill or melinda gates must be alive and active in its administration ; it must continue to qualify as a charity ; and each year it must give away an amount equal to the previous year 's berkshire gift , plus an additional amount equal to 5 percent of net assets . buffett gave the foundation two years to abide by the third requirement . " the gates foundation received 5 % ( 500,000 ) of the shares in july 2006 and will receive 5 % of the remaining earmarked shares in the july of each following year ( 475,000 in 2007 , 451,250 in 2008 ) . in july 2013 , buffet announced another donation of his company 's class b , this time in the amount worth $ 2 billion , is going to the bill and melinda gates foundation .
consistent with the missions and priorities outlined above , the canadian armed forces also contribute to the conduct of canadian defence diplomacy through a range of activities , including the deployment of canadian defence attaches , participation in bilateral and multilateral military forums ( e.g. the system of cooperation among the american air forces ) , ship and aircraft visits , military training and cooperation , and other such outreach and relationship-building efforts .
on september 15 , 2007 , witon barry ( of the tobolar copra processing plant in the marshall islands capital of majuro ) said power authorities , private companies , and entrepreneurs had been experimenting with coconut oil as alternative to diesel fuel for vehicles , power generators , and ships . coconut trees abound in the pacific 's tropical islands . copra , the meat of the coconut , yields coconut oil ( 1 liter for every 6 to 10 coconuts ) . in 2009 , a 57 kw solar power plant was installed , the largest in the pacific at the time , including new zealand . it is estimated that 330 kw of solar and 450 kw of wind power would be required to make the college of the marshall islands energy self-sufficient . marshalls energy company ( mec ) , a government entity , provides the islands with electricity . in 2008 , 420 solar home systems of 200 wp each were installed on ailinglaplap atoll , sufficient for limited electricity use .
constantius , renewing his previous policies favoring the arians , banished athanasius from alexandria once again . this was followed , in 356 , by an attempt to arrest athanasius during a vigil service . athanasius fled to upper egypt , where he stayed in several monasteries and other houses . during this period , athanasius completed his work four orations against the arians and defended his own recent conduct in the apology to constantius and apology for his flight . constantius 's persistence in his opposition to athanasius , combined with reports athanasius received about the persecution of non-arians by the new arian bishop george of laodicea , prompted athanasius to write his more emotional history of the arians , in which he described constantius as a precursor of the antichrist .
saint barthelemy was for many years a french commune forming part of guadeloupe , which is an overseas region and department of france . through a referendum in 2003 , island residents sought separation from the administrative jurisdiction of guadeloupe , and it was finally accomplished in 2007 . the island of saint barthelemy became an overseas collectivity ( com ) . a governing territorial council was elected for its administration , which has provided the island with a certain degree of autonomy . the hotel de ville , which was the town hall , is now the hotel de la collectivite . a senator represents the island in paris . st. barthelemy has retained its free port status .
the first president of the bank was wim duisenberg , the former president of the dutch central bank and the european monetary institute . while duisenberg had been the head of the emi ( taking over from alexandre lamfalussy of belgium ) just before the ecb came into existence , the french government wanted jean-claude trichet , former head of the french central bank , to be the ecb 's first president . the french argued that since the ecb was to be located in germany , its president should be french . this was opposed by the german , dutch and belgian governments who saw duisenberg as a guarantor of a strong euro . tensions were abated by a gentleman 's agreement in which duisenberg would stand down before the end of his mandate , to be replaced by trichet .
the sultanate of ifat , led by the walashma dynasty with its capital at zeila , ruled over parts of what is now eastern ethiopia , djibouti , and northern somalia . the historian al-umari records that ifat was situated near the red sea coast , and states its size as 15 days travel by 20 days travel . its army numbered 15,000 horsemen and 20,000 foot soldiers . al-umari also credits ifat with seven " mother cities " : belqulzar , kuljura , shimi , shewa , adal , jamme and laboo .
in june 1837 chopin visited london incognito in the company of the piano manufacturer camille pleyel where he played at a musical soiree at the house of english piano maker james broadwood . on his return to paris , his association with sand began in earnest , and by the end of june 1838 they had become lovers . sand , who was six years older than the composer , and who had had a series of lovers , wrote at this time : " i must say i was confused and amazed at the effect this little creature had on me ... i have still not recovered from my astonishment , and if i were a proud person i should be feeling humiliated at having been carried away ... " the two spent a miserable winter on majorca ( 8 november 1838 to 13 february 1839 ) , where , together with sand 's two children , they had journeyed in the hope of improving the health of chopin and that of sand 's 15-year-old son maurice , and also to escape the threats of sand 's former lover felicien mallefille . after discovering that the couple were not married , the deeply traditional catholic people of majorca became inhospitable , making accommodation difficult to find . this compelled the group to take lodgings in a former carthusian monastery in valldemossa , which gave little shelter from the cold winter weather .
wound colonization refers to nonreplicating microorganisms within the wound , while in infected wounds , replicating organisms exist and tissue is injured . all multicellular organisms are colonized to some degree by extrinsic organisms , and the vast majority of these exist in either a mutualistic or commensal relationship with the host . an example of the former is the anaerobic bacteria species , which colonizes the mammalian colon , and an example of the latter is various species of staphylococcus that exist on human skin . neither of these colonizations are considered infections . the difference between an infection and a colonization is often only a matter of circumstance . non-pathogenic organisms can become pathogenic given specific conditions , and even the most virulent organism requires certain circumstances to cause a compromising infection . some colonizing bacteria , such as corynebacteria sp. and viridans streptococci , prevent the adhesion and colonization of pathogenic bacteria and thus have a symbiotic relationship with the host , preventing infection and speeding wound healing .
subsequent to these developments , randall collins ( 2004 ) formulated his interaction ritual theory by drawing on durkheim 's work on totemic rituals that was extended by goffman ( 1964 / 2013 ; 1967 ) into everyday focused encounters . based on interaction ritual theory , we experience different levels or intensities of emotional energy during face-to-face interactions . emotional energy is considered to be a feeling of confidence to take action and a boldness that one experiences when they are charged up from the collective effervescence generated during group gatherings that reach high levels of intensity .

a language-independent alternative used in many countries is to hold up one 's two fists with the index knuckle of the left hand against the index knuckle of the right hand . then , starting with january from the little knuckle of the left hand , count knuckle , space , knuckle , space through the months . a knuckle represents a month of 31 days , and a space represents a short month ( a 28- or 29-day february or any 30-day month ) . the junction between the hands is not counted , so the two index knuckles represent july and august .
video data may be represented as a series of still image frames . the sequence of frames contains spatial and temporal redundancy that video compression algorithms attempt to eliminate or code in a smaller size . similarities can be encoded by only storing differences between frames , or by using perceptual features of human vision . for example , small differences in color are more difficult to perceive than are changes in brightness . compression algorithms can average a color across these similar areas to reduce space , in a manner similar to those used in jpeg image compression . some of these methods are inherently lossy while others may preserve all relevant information from the original , uncompressed video .
alloying a metal is done by combining it with one or more other metals or non-metals that often enhance its properties . for example , steel is stronger than iron , its primary element . the electrical and thermal conductivity of alloys is usually lower than that of the pure metals . the physical properties , such as density , reactivity , young 's modulus of an alloy may not differ greatly from those of its elements , but engineering properties such as tensile strength and shear strength may be substantially different from those of the constituent materials . this is sometimes a result of the sizes of the atoms in the alloy , because larger atoms exert a compressive force on neighboring atoms , and smaller atoms exert a tensile force on their neighbors , helping the alloy resist deformation . sometimes alloys may exhibit marked differences in behavior even when small amounts of one element are present . for example , impurities in semiconducting ferromagnetic alloys lead to different properties , as first predicted by white , hogan , suhl , tian abrie and nakamura . some alloys are made by melting and mixing two or more metals . bronze , an alloy of copper and tin , was the first alloy discovered , during the prehistoric period now known as the bronze age ; it was harder than pure copper and originally used to make tools and weapons , but was later superseded by metals and alloys with better properties . in later times bronze has been used for ornaments , bells , statues , and bearings . brass is an alloy made from copper and zinc .
houston was incorporated in 1837 under the ward system of representation . the ward designation is the progenitor of the eleven current-day geographically oriented houston city council districts . locations in houston are generally classified as either being inside or outside the interstate 610 loop . the inside encompasses the central business district and many residential neighborhoods that predate world war ii . more recently , high-density residential areas have been developed within the loop . the city 's outlying areas , suburbs and enclaves are located outside of the loop . beltway 8 encircles the city another 5 miles ( 8.0 km ) farther out .
agriculture is dominated by the cultivation and sale of food crops such as cassava , peanuts , maize , sorghum , millet , sesame , and plantain . the annual real gdp growth rate is just above 3 % . the importance of food crops over exported cash crops is indicated by the fact that the total production of cassava , the staple food of most central africans , ranges between 200,000 and 300,000 tonnes a year , while the production of cotton , the principal exported cash crop , ranges from 25,000 to 45,000 tonnes a year . food crops are not exported in large quantities , but still constitute the principal cash crops of the country , because central africans derive far more income from the periodic sale of surplus food crops than from exported cash crops such as cotton or coffee . [ citation needed ] much of the country is self-sufficient in food crops ; however , livestock development is hindered by the presence of the tsetse fly . [ citation needed ]
in 1803 , an act of parliament , promoted by the east india company , established the east india dock company , with the aim of establishing a new set of docks ( the east india docks ) primarily for the use of ships trading with india . the existing brunswick dock , part of the blackwall yard site , became the export dock ; while a new import dock was built to the north . in 1838 the east india dock company merged with the west india dock company . the docks were taken over by the port of london authority in 1909 , and closed in 1967 .
prior to 1917 , turkey used the lunar islamic calendar with the hegira era for general purposes and the julian calendar for fiscal purposes . the start of the fiscal year was eventually fixed at 1 march and the year number was roughly equivalent to the hegira year ( see rumi calendar ) . as the solar year is longer than the lunar year this originally entailed the use of " escape years " every so often when the number of the fiscal year would jump . from 1 march 1917 the fiscal year became gregorian , rather than julian . on 1 january 1926 the use of the gregorian calendar was extended to include use for general purposes and the number of the year became the same as in other countries .
beyonce has received praise for her stage presence and voice during live performances . jarett wieselman of the new york post placed her at number one on her list of the five best singer / dancers . according to barbara ellen of the guardian beyonce is the most in-charge female artist she 's seen onstage , while alice jones of the independent wrote she " takes her role as entertainer so seriously she 's almost too good . " the ex-president of def jam l.a. reid has described beyonce as the greatest entertainer alive . jim farber of the daily news and stephanie classen of star phoenix both praised her strong voice and her stage presence .
also on the north side is the suburban community of catalina foothills , located in the foothills of the santa catalina mountains just north of the city limits . this community includes among the area 's most expensive homes , sometimes multimillion-dollar estates . the foothills area is generally defined as north of river road , east of oracle road , and west of sabino creek . some of the tucson area 's major resorts are located in the catalina foothills , including the hacienda del sol , westin la paloma resort , loews ventana canyon resort and canyon ranch resort . la encantada , an upscale outdoor shopping mall , is also in the foothills .
between 1948 and 1958 , the jewish population rose from 800,000 to two million . currently , jews account for 75.4 % of the israeli population , or 6 million people . the early years of the state of israel were marked by the mass immigration of holocaust survivors in the aftermath of the holocaust and jews fleeing arab lands . israel also has a large population of ethiopian jews , many of whom were airlifted to israel in the late 1980s and early 1990s . between 1974 and 1979 nearly 227,258 immigrants arrived in israel , about half being from the soviet union . this period also saw an increase in immigration to israel from western europe , latin america , and north america .
the permanent headquarters of the arab league are located in cairo and the body 's secretary general has traditionally been egyptian . this position is currently held by former foreign minister nabil el-araby . the arab league briefly moved from egypt to tunis in 1978 to protest the egypt-israel peace treaty , but it later returned to cairo in 1989 . gulf monarchies , including the united arab emirates and saudi arabia , have pledged billions of dollars to help egypt overcome its economic difficulties since the july 2013 coup .
designed by masayuki uemura , the designer of the original famicom , the super famicom was released in japan on wednesday , november 21 , 1990 for ¥ 25,000 ( us $ 210 ) . it was an instant success ; nintendo 's initial shipment of 300,000 units sold out within hours , and the resulting social disturbance led the japanese government to ask video game manufacturers to schedule future console releases on weekends . the system 's release also gained the attention of the yakuza , leading to a decision to ship the devices at night to avoid robbery .
these ongoing efforts contributed to the formation of the football association ( the fa ) in 1863 , which first met on the morning of 26 october 1863 at the freemasons ' tavern in great queen street , london . the only school to be represented on this occasion was charterhouse . the freemason 's tavern was the setting for five more meetings between october and december , which eventually produced the first comprehensive set of rules . at the final meeting , the first fa treasurer , the representative from blackheath , withdrew his club from the fa over the removal of two draft rules at the previous meeting : the first allowed for running with the ball in hand ; the second for obstructing such a run by hacking ( kicking an opponent in the shins ) , tripping and holding . other english rugby clubs followed this lead and did not join the fa and instead in 1871 formed the rugby football union . the eleven remaining clubs , under the charge of ebenezer cobb morley , went on to ratify the original thirteen laws of the game . these rules included handling of the ball by " marks " and the lack of a crossbar , rules which made it remarkably similar to victorian rules football being developed at that time in australia . the sheffield fa played by its own rules until the 1870s with the fa absorbing some of its rules until there was little difference between the games .
britain had successful tested a new haa gun , 3.6-inch , in 1918 . in 1928 3.7-inch became the preferred solution , but it took 6 years to gain funding . production of the qf 3.7-inch ( 94 mm ) began in 1937 ; this gun was used both on mobile carriages with the field army and transportable guns on fixed mountings for static positions . at the same time the royal navy adopted a new 4.5-inch ( 114 mm ) gun in a twin turret , which the army adopted in simplified single-gun mountings for static positions , mostly around ports where naval ammunition was available . however , the performance of both 3.7 and 4.5-in guns was limited by their standard fuse no 199 , with a 30-second running time , although a new mechanical time fuse giving 43 seconds was nearing readiness . in 1939 a machine fuse setter was introduced to eliminate manual fuse setting .
the oldest known archaeological fragments of the immediate precursor to modern paper , date to the 2nd century bc in china . the pulp papermaking process is ascribed to cai lun , a 2nd-century ad han court eunuch . with paper as an effective substitute for silk in many applications , china could export silk in greater quantity , contributing to a golden age .
in may 2013 , microsoft launched a new television campaign for windows 8 illustrating the capabilities and pricing of windows 8 tablets in comparison to the ipad , which featured the voice of siri remarking on the ipad 's limitations in a parody of apple 's " get a mac " advertisements . on june 12 , 2013 during game 1 of the 2013 stanley cup finals , microsoft premiered the first ad in its " windows everywhere " campaign , which promoted windows 8 , windows phone 8 , and the company 's suite of online services as an interconnected platform .
since the maps projects ' completion , the downtown area has seen continued development . several downtown buildings are undergoing renovation / restoration . notable among these was the restoration of the skirvin hotel in 2007 . the famed first national center is being renovated .
in flood lamps used for photographic lighting , the tradeoff is made in the other direction . compared to general-service bulbs , for the same power , these bulbs produce far more light , and ( more importantly ) light at a higher color temperature , at the expense of greatly reduced life ( which may be as short as two hours for a type p1 lamp ) . the upper temperature limit for the filament is the melting point of the metal . tungsten is the metal with the highest melting point , 3,695 k ( 6,191 ° f ) . a 50-hour-life projection bulb , for instance , is designed to operate only 50 ° c ( 122 ° f ) below that melting point . such a lamp may achieve up to 22 lumens per watt , compared with 17.5 for a 750-hour general service lamp .
saint athanasius of alexandria ( / ˌæθəˈneɪʃəs / ; greek : αθανασιος αλεξανδρειας , athanasios alexandrias ; c . 296-298 - 2 may 373 ) , also called athanasius the great , athanasius the confessor or , primarily in the coptic orthodox church , athanasius the apostolic , was the twentieth bishop of alexandria ( as athanasius i ) . his episcopate lasted 45 years ( c . 8 june 328 - 2 may 373 ) , of which over 17 were spent in five exiles ordered by four different roman emperors . athanasius is a renowned christian theologian , a church father , the chief defender of trinitarianism against arianism , and a noted egyptian leader of the fourth century .
in the papal states , which existed until 1870 , jews were required to live only in specified neighborhoods called ghettos . in the 19th and ( before the end of world war ii ) 20th centuries , the roman catholic church adhered to a distinction between " good antisemitism " and " bad antisemitism . " the " bad " kind promoted hatred of jews because of their descent . this was considered un-christian because the christian message was intended for all of humanity regardless of ethnicity ; anyone could become a christian . the " good " kind criticized alleged jewish conspiracies to control newspapers , banks , and other institutions , to care only about accumulation of wealth , etc .
while the notion that structural and aesthetic considerations should be entirely subject to functionality was met with both popularity and skepticism , it had the effect of introducing the concept of " function " in place of vitruvius ' " utility . " " function " came to be seen as encompassing all criteria of the use , perception and enjoyment of a building , not only practical but also aesthetic , psychological and cultural .
during the summer growing season , phosphate is at a high level . it has a vital role in the breakdown of the sugars manufactured by chlorophyll . but in the fall , phosphate , along with the other chemicals and nutrients , moves out of the leaf into the stem of the plant . when this happens , the sugar-breakdown process changes , leading to the production of anthocyanin pigments . the brighter the light during this period , the greater the production of anthocyanins and the more brilliant the resulting color display . when the days of autumn are bright and cool , and the nights are chilly but not freezing , the brightest colorations usually develop .
an important part of traditional , pre-generative schools of phonology is studying which sounds can be grouped into distinctive units within a language ; these units are known as phonemes . for example , in english , the " p " sound in pot is aspirated ( pronounced [ pʰ ] ) while that in spot is not aspirated ( pronounced [ p ] ) . however , english speakers intuitively treat both sounds as variations ( allophones ) of the same phonological category , that is of the phoneme / p / . ( traditionally , it would be argued that if an aspirated [ pʰ ] were interchanged with the unaspirated [ p ] in spot , native speakers of english would still hear the same words ; that is , the two sounds are perceived as " the same " / p / . ) in some other languages , however , these two sounds are perceived as different , and they are consequently assigned to different phonemes . for example , in thai , hindi , and quechua , there are minimal pairs of words for which aspiration is the only contrasting feature ( two words can have different meanings but with the only difference in pronunciation being that one has an aspirated sound where the other has an unaspirated one ) .
in the beginning of 1996 , several human rights groups brought cases to hold shell accountable for alleged human rights violations in nigeria , including summary execution , crimes against humanity , torture , inhumane treatment and arbitrary arrest and detention . in particular , shell stood accused of collaborating in the execution of ken saro-wiwa and eight other leaders of the ogoni tribe of southern nigeria , who were hanged in 1995 by nigeria 's then military rulers . the lawsuits were brought against royal dutch shell and brian anderson , the head of its nigerian operation . in 2009 , shell agreed to pay $ 15.5m in a legal settlement . shell has not accepted any liability over the allegations against it .
president franklin d. roosevelt promoted a " good neighbor " policy that sought better relations with mexico . in 1935 a federal judge ruled that three mexican immigrants were ineligible for citizenship because they were not white , as required by federal law . mexico protested , and roosevelt decided to circumvent the decision and make sure the federal government treated hispanics as white . the state department , the census bureau , the labor department , and other government agencies therefore made sure to uniformly classify people of mexican descent as white . this policy encouraged the league of united latin american citizens in its quest to minimize discrimination by asserting their whiteness .
protestantism spread in europe during the 16th century . lutheranism spread from germany into its surrounding areas , [ c ] denmark , [ d ] norway , [ e ] sweden , [ f ] finland , [ g ] prussia , [ h ] latvia , [ i ] , estonia , [ j ] and iceland , [ k ] as well as other smaller territories . reformed churches were founded primarily in germany and its adjacent regions , [ l ] hungary , [ m ] the netherlands , [ n ] scotland , [ o ] switzerland , [ p ] and france [ q ] by such reformers as john calvin , huldrych zwingli , and john knox . arminianism [ r ] gained supporters in the netherlands and parts of germany . in 1534 , king henry viii put an end to all papal jurisdiction in england [ s ] after the pope failed to annul his marriage to catherine of aragon ; this opened the door to reformational ideas , notably during the following reign of edward vi , through thomas cranmer , richard hooker , matthew parker and other theologians . there were also reformational efforts throughout continental europe known as the radical reformation - a response to perceived corruption in both the roman catholic church and the expanding magisterial reformation led by luther and various other reformers - which gave rise to anabaptist , moravian , and other pietistic movements . in later centuries , protestants developed their own culture , which made major contributions in education , the humanities and sciences , the political and social order , the economy and the arts , and other fields .
while the big bang model is well established in cosmology , it is likely to be refined in the future . little is known about the earliest moments of the universe 's history . the penrose-hawking singularity theorems require the existence of a singularity at the beginning of cosmic time . however , these theorems assume that general relativity is correct , but general relativity must break down before the universe reaches the planck temperature , and a correct treatment of quantum gravity may avoid the singularity .
the delhi flying club , established in 1928 with two de havilland moth aircraft named delhi and roshanara , was based at safdarjung airport which started operations in 1929 , when it was the delhi 's only airport and the second in india . the airport functioned until 2001 , however in january 2002 the government closed the airport for flying activities because of security concerns following the new york attacks in september 2001 . since then , the club only carries out aircraft maintenance courses , and is used for helicopter rides to indira gandhi international airport for vip including the president and the prime minister .
under modern constitutional conventions , the sovereign acts on the advice of his or her ministers . since these ministers most often maintain the support of parliament and are the ones who obtain the passage of bills , it is highly improbable that they would advise the sovereign to withhold assent . an exception is sometimes stated to be if bills are not passed in good faith , though it is difficult to make an interpretation on what this circumstance might constitute . hence , in modern practice , royal assent is always granted ; a refusal to do so would be appropriate only in an emergency requiring the use of the monarch 's reserve powers .
hemimetabolous insects , those with incomplete metamorphosis , change gradually by undergoing a series of molts . an insect molts when it outgrows its exoskeleton , which does not stretch and would otherwise restrict the insect 's growth . the molting process begins as the insect 's epidermis secretes a new epicuticle inside the old one . after this new epicuticle is secreted , the epidermis releases a mixture of enzymes that digests the endocuticle and thus detaches the old cuticle . when this stage is complete , the insect makes its body swell by taking in a large quantity of water or air , which makes the old cuticle split along predefined weaknesses where the old exocuticle was thinnest . : 142
in august 2008 , west revealed plans to open 10 fatburger restaurants in the chicago area ; the first was set to open in september 2008 in orland park . the second followed in january 2009 , while a third location is yet to be revealed , although the process is being finalized . his company , kw foods llc , bought the rights to the chain in chicago . ultimately , in 2009 , only two locations actually opened . in february 2011 , west shut down the fatburger located in orland park . later that year , the remaining beverly location also was shuttered .
german philosophers have helped shape western philosophy from as early as the middle ages ( albertus magnus ) . later , leibniz ( 17th century ) and most importantly kant played central roles in the history of philosophy . kantianism inspired the work of schopenhauer and nietzsche as well as german idealism defended by fichte and hegel . engels helped develop communist theory in the second half of the 19th century while heidegger and gadamer pursued the tradition of german philosophy in the 20th century . a number of german intellectuals were also influential in sociology , most notably adorno , habermas , horkheimer , luhmann , simmel , tonnies , and weber . the university of berlin founded in 1810 by linguist and philosopher wilhelm von humboldt served as an influential model for a number of modern western universities .
one person may presume knowledge of another person 's sexual orientation based upon perceived characteristics , such as appearance , clothing , tone of voice , and accompaniment by and behavior with other people . the attempt to detect sexual orientation in social situations is known as gaydar ; some studies have found that guesses based on face photos perform better than chance . 2015 research suggests that " gaydar " is an alternate label for using lgbt stereotypes to infer orientation , and that face-shape is not an accurate indication of orientation .
von neumann was a founding figure in computing . donald knuth cites von neumann as the inventor , in 1945 , of the merge sort algorithm , in which the first and second halves of an array are each sorted recursively and then merged . von neumann wrote the sorting program for the edvac in ink , being 23 pages long ; traces can still be seen on the first page of the phrase " top secret , " which was written in pencil and later erased . he also worked on the philosophy of artificial intelligence with alan turing when the latter visited princeton in the 1930s .
bell 's coffin was constructed of beinn bhreagh pine by his laboratory staff , lined with the same red silk fabric used in his tetrahedral kite experiments . to help celebrate his life , his wife asked guests not to wear black ( the traditional funeral color ) while attending his service , during which soloist jean macdonald sang a verse of robert louis stevenson 's " requiem " :
in 2004 , worldwide sales of audio cds , cd-roms and cd-rs reached about 30 billion discs . by 2007 , 200 billion cds had been sold worldwide . cds are increasingly being replaced by other forms of digital storage and distribution , with the result that audio cd sales rates in the u.s. have dropped about 50 % from their peak ; however , they remain one of the primary distribution methods for the music industry . in 2014 , revenues from digital music services matched those from physical format sales for the first time .
interstate 95 runs through the city along the delaware river as a main north-south artery known as the delaware expressway . the city is also served by the schuylkill expressway , a portion of interstate 76 that runs along the schuylkill river . it meets the pennsylvania turnpike at king of prussia , pennsylvania , providing access to harrisburg , pennsylvania and points west . interstate 676 , the vine street expressway , was completed in 1991 after years of planning . a link between i-95 and i-76 , it runs below street level through center city , connecting to the ben franklin bridge at its eastern end .
the american people are mostly multi-ethnic descendants of various culturally distinct immigrant groups , many of which have now developed nations . some consider themselves multiracial , while acknowledging race as a social construct . creolization , assimilation and integration have been continuing processes . the african-american civil rights movement ( 1955-1968 ) and other social movements since the mid-twentieth century worked to achieve social justice and equal enforcement of civil rights under the constitution for all ethnicities . in the 2000s , less than 5 % of the population identified as multiracial . in many instances , mixed racial ancestry is so far back in an individual 's family history ( for instance , before the civil war or earlier ) , that it does not affect more recent ethnic and cultural identification .
there are many different patterns of gas exchange demonstrated by different groups of insects . gas exchange patterns in insects can range from continuous and diffusive ventilation , to discontinuous gas exchange . : 65-68 during continuous gas exchange , oxygen is taken in and carbon dioxide is released in a continuous cycle . in discontinuous gas exchange , however , the insect takes in oxygen while it is active and small amounts of carbon dioxide are released when the insect is at rest . diffusive ventilation is simply a form of continuous gas exchange that occurs by diffusion rather than physically taking in the oxygen . some species of insect that are submerged also have adaptations to aid in respiration . as larvae , many insects have gills that can extract oxygen dissolved in water , while others need to rise to the water surface to replenish air supplies which may be held or trapped in special structures .
later the muslims invaded spain ( 711 ) , but the arabs and moors never managed to have any real control over galicia , which was later incorporated into the expanding christian kingdom of asturias , usually known as gallaecia or galicia ( yilliqiya and galisiya ) by muslim chroniclers , as well as by many european contemporaries . this era consolidated galicia as a christian society which spoke a romance language . during the next century galician noblemen took northern portugal , conquering coimbra in 871 , thus freeing what were considered the southernmost city of ancient galicia .

after its defeat in the 1979 general election the labour party underwent a period of internal rivalry between the left represented by tony benn , and the right represented by denis healey . the election of michael foot as leader in 1980 , and the leftist policies he espoused , such as unilateral nuclear disarmament , leaving the european economic community ( eec ) and nato , closer governmental influence in the banking system , the creation of a national minimum wage and a ban on fox hunting led in 1981 to four former cabinet ministers from the right of the labour party ( shirley williams , william rodgers , roy jenkins and david owen ) forming the social democratic party . benn was only narrowly defeated by healey in a bitterly fought deputy leadership election in 1981 after the introduction of an electoral college intended to widen the voting franchise to elect the leader and their deputy . by 1982 , the national executive committee had concluded that the entryist militant tendency group were in contravention of the party 's constitution . the militant newspaper 's five member editorial board were expelled on 22 february 1983 .

as with zoneinfo , a user of microsoft windows configures dst by specifying the name of a location , and the operating system then consults a table of rule sets that must be updated when dst rules change . procedures for specifying the name and updating the table vary with release . updates are not issued for older versions of microsoft windows . windows vista supports at most two start and end rules per time zone setting . in a canadian location observing dst , a single vista setting supports both 1987-2006 and post-2006 time stamps , but mishandles some older time stamps . older microsoft windows systems usually store only a single start and end rule for each zone , so that the same canadian setting reliably supports only post-2006 time stamps .
these ongoing efforts contributed to the formation of the football association ( the fa ) in 1863 , which first met on the morning of 26 october 1863 at the freemasons ' tavern in great queen street , london . the only school to be represented on this occasion was charterhouse . the freemason 's tavern was the setting for five more meetings between october and december , which eventually produced the first comprehensive set of rules . at the final meeting , the first fa treasurer , the representative from blackheath , withdrew his club from the fa over the removal of two draft rules at the previous meeting : the first allowed for running with the ball in hand ; the second for obstructing such a run by hacking ( kicking an opponent in the shins ) , tripping and holding . other english rugby clubs followed this lead and did not join the fa and instead in 1871 formed the rugby football union . the eleven remaining clubs , under the charge of ebenezer cobb morley , went on to ratify the original thirteen laws of the game . these rules included handling of the ball by " marks " and the lack of a crossbar , rules which made it remarkably similar to victorian rules football being developed at that time in australia . the sheffield fa played by its own rules until the 1870s with the fa absorbing some of its rules until there was little difference between the games .
the instruments currently used in most classical music were largely invented before the mid-19th century ( often much earlier ) and codified in the 18th and 19th centuries . they consist of the instruments found in an orchestra or in a concert band , together with several other solo instruments ( such as the piano , harpsichord , and organ ) . the symphony orchestra is the most widely known medium for classical music and includes members of the string , woodwind , brass , and percussion families of instruments . the concert band consists of members of the woodwind , brass , and percussion families . it generally has a larger variety and amount of woodwind and brass instruments than the orchestra but does not have a string section . however , many concert bands use a double bass . the vocal practices changed a great deal over the classical period , from the single line monophonic gregorian chant done by monks in the medieval period to the complex , polyphonic choral works of the renaissance and subsequent periods , which used multiple independent vocal melodies at the same time .
nicholas began courting britain by means of conversations with the british ambassador , george hamilton seymour , in january and february 1853 . : 105 nicholas insisted that he no longer wished to expand imperial russia : 105 but that he had an obligation to the christian communities in the ottoman empire . : 105 the tsar next dispatched a highly abrasive diplomat , prince menshikov , on a special mission to the ottoman sublime porte in february 1853 . by previous treaties , the sultan was committed " to protect the ( eastern orthodox ) christian religion and its churches .

the kingdom of pontus was a hellenistic kingdom on the southern coast of the black sea . it was founded by mithridates i in 291 bc and lasted until its conquest by the roman republic in 63 bc . despite being ruled by a dynasty which was a descendant of the persian achaemenid empire it became hellenized due to the influence of the greek cities on the black sea and its neighboring kingdoms . pontic culture was a mix of greek and iranian elements , the most hellenized parts of the kingdom were on the coast , populated by greek colonies such as trapezus and sinope , which became the capital of the kingdom . epigraphic evidence also shows extensive hellenistic influence in the interior . during the reign of mithridates ii , pontus was allied with the seleucids through dynastic marriages . by the time of mithridates vi eupator , greek was the official language of the kingdom though anatolian languages continued to be spoken .
italy is home to a vast array of native regional minority languages , most of which are romance-based and have their own local variants . these regional languages are often referred to colloquially or in non-linguistic circles as italian " dialects , " or dialetti ( standard italian for " dialects " ) . however , the majority of the regional languages in italy are in fact not actually " dialects " of standard italian in the strict linguistic sense , as they are not derived from modern standard italian but instead evolved locally from vulgar latin independent of standard italian , with little to no influence from what is now known as " standard italian . " they are therefore better classified as individual languages rather than " dialects . "

copper , silver and gold are in group 11 of the periodic table , and they share certain attributes : they have one s-orbital electron on top of a filled d-electron shell and are characterized by high ductility and electrical conductivity . the filled d-shells in these elements do not contribute much to the interatomic interactions , which are dominated by the s-electrons through metallic bonds . unlike metals with incomplete d-shells , metallic bonds in copper are lacking a covalent character and are relatively weak . this explains the low hardness and high ductility of single crystals of copper . at the macroscopic scale , introduction of extended defects to the crystal lattice , such as grain boundaries , hinders flow of the material under applied stress , thereby increasing its hardness . for this reason , copper is usually supplied in a fine-grained polycrystalline form , which has greater strength than monocrystalline forms .
cancer is now common in developing countries . according to a study by the international agency for research on cancer , " in the developing world , cancers of the liver , stomach and esophagus were more common , often linked to consumption of carcinogenic preserved foods , such as smoked or salted food , and parasitic infections that attack organs . " lung cancer rates are rising rapidly in poorer nations because of increased use of tobacco . developed countries " tended to have cancers linked to affluence or a ' western lifestyle ' - cancers of the colon , rectum , breast and prostate - that can be caused by obesity , lack of exercise , diet and age .

han-era astronomers adopted a geocentric model of the universe , theorizing that it was shaped like a sphere surrounding the earth in the center . they assumed that the sun , moon , and planets were spherical and not disc-shaped . they also thought that the illumination of the moon and planets was caused by sunlight , that lunar eclipses occurred when the earth obstructed sunlight falling onto the moon , and that a solar eclipse occurred when the moon obstructed sunlight from reaching the earth . although others disagreed with his model , wang chong accurately described the water cycle of the evaporation of water into clouds .
in a wrim , the rotor winding is made of many turns of insulated wire and is connected to slip rings on the motor shaft . an external resistor or other control devices can be connected in the rotor circuit . resistors allow control of the motor speed , although significant power is dissipated in the external resistance . a converter can be fed from the rotor circuit and return the slip-frequency power that would otherwise be wasted back into the power system through an inverter or separate motor-generator .
constantius , renewing his previous policies favoring the arians , banished athanasius from alexandria once again . this was followed , in 356 , by an attempt to arrest athanasius during a vigil service . athanasius fled to upper egypt , where he stayed in several monasteries and other houses . during this period , athanasius completed his work four orations against the arians and defended his own recent conduct in the apology to constantius and apology for his flight . constantius 's persistence in his opposition to athanasius , combined with reports athanasius received about the persecution of non-arians by the new arian bishop george of laodicea , prompted athanasius to write his more emotional history of the arians , in which he described constantius as a precursor of the antichrist .

the inhabitants of the british isles have been drinking ale since the bronze age , but it was with the arrival of the roman empire in its shores in the 1st century , and the construction of the roman road networks that the first inns , called tabernae , in which travellers could obtain refreshment began to appear . after the departure of roman authority in the 5th century and the fall of the romano-british kingdoms , the anglo-saxons established alehouses that grew out of domestic dwellings , the anglo-saxon alewife would put a green bush up on a pole to let people know her brew was ready . these alehouses quickly evolved into meeting houses for the folk to socially congregate , gossip and arrange mutual help within their communities . herein lies the origin of the modern public house , or " pub " as it is colloquially called in england . they rapidly spread across the kingdom , becoming so commonplace that in 965 king edgar decreed that there should be no more than one alehouse per village .

in 1937 over 100 people died after ingesting " elixir sulfanilamide " manufactured by s.e. massengill company of tennessee . the product was formulated in diethylene glycol , a highly toxic solvent that is now widely used as antifreeze . under the laws extant at that time , prosecution of the manufacturer was possible only under the technicality that the product had been called an " elixir , " which literally implied a solution in ethanol . in response to this episode , the u.s. congress passed the federal food , drug , and cosmetic act of 1938 , which for the first time required pre-market demonstration of safety before a drug could be sold , and explicitly prohibited false therapeutic claims .
at buya in eritrea , one of the oldest hominids representing a possible link between homo erectus and an archaic homo sapiens was found by italian scientists . dated to over 1 million years old , it is the oldest skeletal find of its kind and provides a link between hominids and the earliest anatomically modern humans . it is believed that the section of the danakil depression in eritrea was also a major player in terms of human evolution , and may contain other traces of evolution from homo erectus hominids to anatomically modern humans .
artifacts from the paleolithic suggest that the moon was used to reckon time as early as 6,000 years ago . lunar calendars were among the first to appear , either 12 or 13 lunar months ( either 354 or 384 days ) . without intercalation to add days or months to some years , seasons quickly drift in a calendar based solely on twelve lunar months . lunisolar calendars have a thirteenth month added to some years to make up for the difference between a full year ( now known to be about 365.24 days ) and a year of just twelve lunar months . the numbers twelve and thirteen came to feature prominently in many cultures , at least partly due to this relationship of months to years . other early forms of calendars originated in mesoamerica , particularly in ancient mayan civilization . these calendars were religiously and astronomically based , with 18 months in a year and 20 days in a month .
while on one hand the heian period was an unusually long period of peace , it can also be argued that the period weakened japan economically and led to poverty for all but a tiny few of its inhabitants . the control of rice fields provided a key source of income for families such as the fujiwara and were a fundamental base for their power . the aristocratic beneficiaries of heian culture , the ryomin ( 良民 " good people " ) numbered about five thousand in a land of perhaps five million . one reason the samurai were able to take power was that the ruling nobility proved incompetent at managing japan and its provinces . by the year 1000 the government no longer knew how to issue currency and money was gradually disappearing . instead of a fully realised system of money circulation , rice was the primary unit of exchange . the lack of a solid medium of economic exchange is implicitly illustrated in novels of the time . for instance , messengers were rewarded with useful objects , e.g. , an old silk kimono , rather than paid a fee .
large numbers of bolivian highland peasants retained indigenous language , culture , customs , and communal organization throughout the spanish conquest and the post-independence period . they mobilized to resist various attempts at the dissolution of communal landholdings and used legal recognition of " empowered caciques " to further communal organization . indigenous revolts took place frequently until 1953 . while the national revolutionary movement government begun in 1952 discouraged self-identification as indigenous ( reclassifying rural people as campesinos , or peasants ) , renewed ethnic and class militancy re-emerged in the katarista movement beginning in the 1970s . lowland indigenous peoples , mostly in the east , entered national politics through the 1990 march for territory and dignity organized by the cidob confederation . that march successfully pressured the national government to sign the ilo convention 169 and to begin the still-ongoing process of recognizing and titling indigenous territories . the 1994 law of popular participation granted " grassroots territorial organizations " that are recognized by the state certain rights to govern local areas .
in the 1960 election to choose his successor , eisenhower endorsed his own vice president , republican richard nixon against democrat john f. kennedy . he told friends , " i will do almost anything to avoid turning my chair and country over to kennedy . " he actively campaigned for nixon in the final days , although he may have done nixon some harm . when asked by reporters at the end of a televised press conference to list one of nixon 's policy ideas he had adopted , eisenhower joked , " if you give me a week , i might think of one . i don 't remember . " kennedy 's campaign used the quote in one of its campaign commercials . nixon narrowly lost to kennedy . eisenhower , who was the oldest president in history at that time ( then 70 ) , was succeeded by the youngest elected president , as kennedy was 43 .

christianity ( 59 % ) , particularly catholicism ( 33 % ) , was the most prevalently practiced religion in new york as of 2014 , followed by judaism , with approximately 1.1 million jews in new york city , over half living in brooklyn . islam ranks third in new york city , with official estimates ranging between 600,000 and 1,000,000 observers and including 10 % of the city 's public schoolchildren , followed by hinduism , buddhism , and a variety of other religions , as well as atheism . in 2014 , 24 % self-identified with no organized religious affiliation .
for much of eton 's history , junior boys had to act as " fags , " or servants , to older boys . their duties included cleaning , cooking , and running errands . a library member was entitled to yell at any time and without notice , " boy , up ! " or " boy , queue ! , " and all first-year boys had to come running . the last boy to arrive was given the task . these practices , known as fagging , were partially phased out of most houses in the 1970s . captains of house and games still sometimes give tasks to first-year boys , such as collecting the mail from school office .

five major climatic regions are found in nepal . of these , kathmandu valley is in the warm temperate zone ( elevation ranging from 1,200-2,300 metres ( 3,900-7,500 ft ) ) , where the climate is fairly temperate , atypical for the region . this zone is followed by the cool temperate zone with elevation varying between 2,100-3,300 metres ( 6,900-10,800 ft ) . under koppen 's climate classification , portions of the city with lower elevations have a humid subtropical climate ( cwa ) , while portions of the city with higher elevations generally have a subtropical highland climate . in the kathmandu valley , which is representative of its valley 's climate , the average summer temperature varies from 28-30 ° c ( 82-86 ° f ) . the average winter temperature is 10.1 ° c ( 50.2 ° f ) .
during the 1930s , the first two motorways were built across the land , the a4 motorway as an important east-west connection in central germany and the main link between berlin and south-west germany , and the a9 motorway as the main north-south route in eastern germany , connecting berlin with munich . the a4 runs from frankfurt in hesse via eisenach , gotha , erfurt , weimar , jena and gera to dresden in saxony , connecting thuringia 's most important cities . at hermsdorf junction it is connected with the a9 . both highways were widened from four to six lanes ( three each way ) after 1990 , including some extensive re-routing in the eisenach and jena areas . furthermore , three new motorways were built during the 1990s and 2000s . the a71 crosses the land in southwest-northeast direction , connecting wurzburg in bavaria via meiningen , suhl , ilmenau , arnstadt , erfurt and sommerda with sangerhausen and halle in saxony-anhalt . the crossing of the thuringian forest by the a71 has been one of germany 's most expensive motorway segments with various tunnels ( including germany 's longest road tunnel , the rennsteig tunnel ) and large bridges . the a73 starts at the a71 south of erfurt in suhl and runs south towards nuremberg in bavaria . the a38 is another west-east connection in the north of thuringia running from gottingen in lower saxony via heiligenstadt and nordhausen to leipzig in saxony . furthermore , there is a dense network of federal highways complementing the motorway network . the upgrading of federal highways is prioritised in the federal trunk road programme 2015 ( bundesverkehrswegeplan 2015 ) . envisaged projects include upgrades of the b247 from gotha to leinefelde to improve muhlhausen 's connection to the national road network , the b19 from eisenach to meiningen to improve access to bad salzungen and schmalkalden , and the b88 and b281 for strengthening the saalfeld / rudolstadt region .
olin has a network of more than 16,000 alumni worldwide . over the last several years , the school 's endowment has increased to $ 213 million ( 2004 ) and annual gifts average $ 12 million per year . [ citation needed ] simon hall was opened in 1986 after a donation from john e. simon . on may 2 , 2014 , the $ 90 million conjoined knight and bauer halls were dedicated , following a $ 15 million gift from charles f. knight and joanne knight and a $ 10 million gift from george and carol bauer through the bauer foundation .
however , excessive hunting and poachers have also contributed heavily to the endangerment , extirpation and extinction of many animals , such as the quagga , the great auk , steller 's sea cow , the thylacine , the bluebuck , the arabian oryx , the caspian and javan tigers , the markhor , the sumatran rhinoceros , the bison , the north american cougar , the altai argali sheep , the asian elephant and many more , primarily for commercial sale or sport . all these animals have been hunted to endangerment or extinction .
in presidential elections , montana was long classified as a swing state , though the state has voted for the republican candidate in all but two elections from 1952 to the present . the state last supported a democrat for president in 1992 , when bill clinton won a plurality victory . overall , since 1889 the state has voted for democratic governors 60 percent of the time and democratic presidents 40 percent of the time , with these numbers being 40 / 60 for republican candidates . in the 2008 presidential election , montana was considered a swing state and was ultimately won by republican john mccain , albeit by a narrow margin of two percent .
with the wealth brought on by the gold rush following closely on the heels of the establishment of victoria as a separate colony and the subsequent need for public buildings , a program of grand civic construction soon began . the 1850s and 1860s saw the commencement of parliament house , the treasury building , the old melbourne gaol , victoria barracks , the state library , university , general post office , customs house , the melbourne town hall , st patrick 's cathedral , though many remained uncompleted for decades , with some still not finished .
unlike previous versions of windows , windows 8 was distributed at retail in " upgrade " licenses only , which require an existing version of windows to install . the " full version software " sku , which was more expensive but could be installed on computers without an eligible os or none at all , was discontinued . in lieu of full version , a specialized " system builder " sku was introduced . the " system builder " sku replaced the original equipment manufacturer ( oem ) sku , which was only allowed to be used on pcs meant for resale , but added a " personal use license " exemption that officially allowed its purchase and personal use by users on homebuilt computers .
for decades , the u.s. federal government strenuously tried to force puerto ricans to adopt english , to the extent of making them use english as the primary language of instruction in their high schools . it was completely unsuccessful , and retreated from that policy in 1948 . puerto rico was able to maintain its spanish language , culture , and identity because the relatively small , densely populated island was already home to nearly a million people at the time of the u.s. takeover , all of those spoke spanish , and the territory was never hit with a massive influx of millions of english speakers like the vast territory acquired from mexico 50 years earlier .
gustav had a preference for his elder son , meinhard ( july 17 , 1946 - may 20 , 1971 ) , over arnold . his favoritism was " strong and blatant , " which stemmed from unfounded suspicion that arnold was not his biological child . schwarzenegger has said his father had " no patience for listening or understanding your problems . " schwarzenegger had a good relationship with his mother and kept in touch with her until her death . in later life , schwarzenegger commissioned the simon wiesenthal center to research his father 's wartime record , which came up with no evidence of gustav 's being involved in atrocities , despite gustav 's membership in the nazi party and sa . schwarzenegger 's father 's background received wide press attention during the 2003 california recall campaign . at school , schwarzenegger was apparently in the middle but stood out for his " cheerful , good-humored and exuberant " character . money was a problem in their household ; schwarzenegger recalled that one of the highlights of his youth was when the family bought a refrigerator .
on 3 december , chopin complained about his bad health and the incompetence of the doctors in majorca : " three doctors have visited me ... the first said i was dead ; the second said i was dying ; and the third said i was about to die . " he also had problems having his pleyel piano sent to him . it finally arrived from paris in december . chopin wrote to pleyel in january 1839 : " i am sending you my preludes [ ( op. 28 ) ] . i finished them on your little piano , which arrived in the best possible condition in spite of the sea , the bad weather and the palma customs . " chopin was also able to undertake work on his ballade no. 2 , op. 38 ; two polonaises , op. 40 ; and the scherzo no. 3 , op. 39 .
the first public library in montevideo was formed by the initial donation of the private library of father jose manuel perez castellano , who died in 1815 . its promoter , director and organizer was father damaso antonio larranaga , who also made a considerable donation along with donations from jose raimundo guerra , as well as others from the convent of san francisco in salta . in 1816 its stock was 5,000 volumes .

since 1973 plymouth has been supplied water by south west water . prior to the 1973 take over it was supplied by plymouth county borough corporation . before the 19th century two leats were built in order to provide drinking water for the town . they carried water from dartmoor to plymouth . a watercourse , known as plymouth or drake 's leat , was opened on 24 april 1591 to tap the river meavy . the devonport leat was constructed to carry fresh drinking water to the expanding town of devonport and its ever growing dockyard . it was fed by three dartmoor rivers : the west dart , cowsic and blackabrook . it seems to have been carrying water since 1797 , but it was officially completed in 1801 . it was originally designed to carry water to devonport town , but has since been shortened and now carries water to burrator reservoir , which feeds most of the water supply of plymouth . burrator reservoir is located about 5 miles ( 8 km ) north of the city and was constructed in 1898 and expanded in 1928 .
relations between grand lodges are determined by the concept of recognition . each grand lodge maintains a list of other grand lodges that it recognises . when two grand lodges recognise and are in masonic communication with each other , they are said to be in amity , and the brethren of each may visit each other 's lodges and interact masonically . when two grand lodges are not in amity , inter-visitation is not allowed . there are many reasons why one grand lodge will withhold or withdraw recognition from another , but the two most common are exclusive jurisdiction and regularity .
most ingested uranium is excreted during digestion . only 0.5 % is absorbed when insoluble forms of uranium , such as its oxide , are ingested , whereas absorption of the more soluble uranyl ion can be up to 5 % . however , soluble uranium compounds tend to quickly pass through the body , whereas insoluble uranium compounds , especially when inhaled by way of dust into the lungs , pose a more serious exposure hazard . after entering the bloodstream , the absorbed uranium tends to bioaccumulate and stay for many years in bone tissue because of uranium 's affinity for phosphates . uranium is not absorbed through the skin , and alpha particles released by uranium cannot penetrate the skin .

in many societies , however , a particular dialect , often the sociolect of the elite class , comes to be identified as the " standard " or " proper " version of a language by those seeking to make a social distinction , and is contrasted with other varieties . as a result of this , in some contexts the term " dialect " refers specifically to varieties with low social status . in this secondary sense of " dialect , " language varieties are often called dialects rather than languages :
among the first to study russian dialects was lomonosov in the 18th century . in the 19th , vladimir dal compiled the first dictionary that included dialectal vocabulary . detailed mapping of russian dialects began at the turn of the 20th century . in modern times , the monumental dialectological atlas of the russian language ( диалектологическии атлас русского языка [ dʲɪɐˌlʲɛktəlɐˈɡʲitɕɪskʲɪj ˈatləs ˈruskəvə jɪzɨˈka ] ) , was published in three folio volumes 1986-1989 , after four decades of preparatory work .

the term air defence was probably first used by britain when air defence of great britain ( adgb ) was created as a royal air force command in 1925 . however , arrangements in the uk were also called ' anti-aircraft ' , abbreviated as aa , a term that remained in general use into the 1950s . after the first world war it was sometimes prefixed by ' light ' or ' heavy ' ( laa or haa ) to classify a type of gun or unit . nicknames for anti-aircraft guns include aa , aaa or triple-a , an abbreviation of anti-aircraft artillery ; " ack-ack " ( from the spelling alphabet used by the british for voice transmission of " aa " ) ; and archie ( a world war i british term probably coined by amyas borton and believed to derive via the royal flying corps from the music-hall comedian george robey 's line " archibald , certainly not ! " ) .
during periods of unemployment , there has been a long pattern of emigration from the island since the post-napoleonic period . the majority of " saints " emigrated to the uk , south africa and in the early years , australia . the population has steadily declined since the late 1980s and has dropped from 5,157 at the 1998 census to 4,255 in 2008 . in the past emigration was characterised by young unaccompanied persons leaving to work on long-term contracts on ascension and the falkland islands , but since " saints " were re-awarded uk citizenship in 2002 , emigration to the uk by a wider range of wage-earners has accelerated due to the prospect of higher wages and better progression prospects .
historically , ac motors were used for single or double speed elevator machines on the grounds of cost and lower usage applications where car speed and passenger comfort were less of an issue , but for higher speed , larger capacity elevators , the need for infinitely variable speed control over the traction machine becomes an issue . therefore , dc machines powered by an ac / dc motor generator were the preferred solution . the mg set also typically powered the relay controller of the elevator , which has the added advantage of electrically isolating the elevators from the rest of a building 's electrical system , thus eliminating the transient power spikes in the building 's electrical supply caused by the motors starting and stopping ( causing lighting to dim every time the elevators are used for example ) , as well as interference to other electrical equipment caused by the arcing of the relay contactors in the control system .

in europe , dutch is the majority language in the netherlands ( 96 % ) and belgium ( 59 % ) as well as a minority language in germany and northern france 's french flanders , where it is in the ultimate stage of language death . though belgium as a whole is multilingual , the two regions into which the country is divided ( flanders , francophone wallonia , bilingual brussels and small ' facility ' zones ) are largely monolingual . the netherlands and belgium produce the vast majority of music , films , books and other media written or spoken in dutch . dutch is a monocentric language , with all speakers using the same standard form ( authorized by the dutch language union ) based on a dutch orthography employing the latin alphabet when writing . in stark contrast to its written uniformity , dutch lacks a prestige dialect and has a large dialectal continuum consisting of 28 main dialects , which can themselves be further divided into at least 600 distinguishable varieties .
christianity , judaism , zoroastrianism , and the sunni branch of islam are officially recognized by the government , and have reserved seats in the iranian parliament . but the baha 'i faith , which is said to be the largest non-muslim religious minority in iran , is not officially recognized , and has been persecuted during its existence in iran since the 19th century . since the 1979 revolution , the persecution of bahais has increased with executions , the denial of civil rights and liberties , and the denial of access to higher education and employment .
from their beginnings in sumer ( now iraq ) around 3500 bc , the mesopotamian people began to attempt to record some observations of the world with numerical data . but their observations and measurements were seemingly taken for purposes other than for elucidating scientific laws . a concrete instance of pythagoras ' law was recorded , as early as the 18th century bc : the mesopotamian cuneiform tablet plimpton 322 records a number of pythagorean triplets ( 3,4,5 ) ( 5,12,13 ) . ... , dated 1900 bc , possibly millennia before pythagoras , but an abstract formulation of the pythagorean theorem was not .
ibn tufail ( abubacer ) and ibn al-nafis were pioneers of the philosophical novel . ibn tufail wrote the first arabic novel hayy ibn yaqdhan ( philosophus autodidactus ) as a response to al-ghazali 's the incoherence of the philosophers , and then ibn al-nafis also wrote a novel theologus autodidactus as a response to ibn tufail 's philosophus autodidactus . both of these narratives had protagonists ( hayy in philosophus autodidactus and kamil in theologus autodidactus ) who were autodidactic feral children living in seclusion on a desert island , both being the earliest examples of a desert island story . however , while hayy lives alone with animals on the desert island for the rest of the story in philosophus autodidactus , the story of kamil extends beyond the desert island setting in theologus autodidactus , developing into the earliest known coming of age plot and eventually becoming the first example of a science fiction novel .
building partnerships is described as airmen interacting with international airmen and other relevant actors to develop , guide , and sustain relationships for mutual benefit and security . building partnerships is about interacting with others and is therefore an inherently inter-personal and cross-cultural undertaking . through both words and deeds , the majority of interaction is devoted to building trust-based relationships for mutual benefit . it includes both foreign partners as well as domestic partners and emphasizes collaboration with foreign governments , militaries and populations as well as us government departments , agencies , industry , and ngos . to better facilitate partnering efforts , airmen should be competent in the relevant language , region , and culture .
in 1975 , sadat shifted nasser 's economic policies and sought to use his popularity to reduce government regulations and encourage foreign investment through his program of infitah . through this policy , incentives such as reduced taxes and import tariffs attracted some investors , but investments were mainly directed at low risk and profitable ventures like tourism and construction , abandoning egypt 's infant industries . even though sadat 's policy was intended to modernise egypt and assist the middle class , it mainly benefited the higher class , and , because of the elimination of subsidies on basic foodstuffs , led to the 1977 egyptian bread riots .
plymouth lies between the river plym to the east and the river tamar to the west ; both rivers flow into the natural harbour of plymouth sound . since 1967 , the unitary authority of plymouth has included the , once independent , towns of plympton and plymstock which lie along the east of the river plym . the river tamar forms the county boundary between devon and cornwall and its estuary forms the hamoaze on which is sited devonport dockyard .
in 1840 , a british naval station established to suppress the african slave trade was based on the island , and between 1840 and 1849 over 15,000 freed slaves , known as " liberated africans , " were landed there .
in june 1837 chopin visited london incognito in the company of the piano manufacturer camille pleyel where he played at a musical soiree at the house of english piano maker james broadwood . on his return to paris , his association with sand began in earnest , and by the end of june 1838 they had become lovers . sand , who was six years older than the composer , and who had had a series of lovers , wrote at this time : " i must say i was confused and amazed at the effect this little creature had on me ... i have still not recovered from my astonishment , and if i were a proud person i should be feeling humiliated at having been carried away ... " the two spent a miserable winter on majorca ( 8 november 1838 to 13 february 1839 ) , where , together with sand 's two children , they had journeyed in the hope of improving the health of chopin and that of sand 's 15-year-old son maurice , and also to escape the threats of sand 's former lover felicien mallefille . after discovering that the couple were not married , the deeply traditional catholic people of majorca became inhospitable , making accommodation difficult to find . this compelled the group to take lodgings in a former carthusian monastery in valldemossa , which gave little shelter from the cold winter weather .
freemasonry , as it exists in various forms all over the world , has a membership estimated by the united grand lodge of england at around six million worldwide . the fraternity is administratively organised into independent grand lodges ( or sometimes grand orients ) , each of which governs its own masonic jurisdiction , which consists of subordinate ( or constituent ) lodges . the largest single jurisdiction , in terms of membership , is the united grand lodge of england ( with a membership estimated at around a quarter million ) . the grand lodge of scotland and grand lodge of ireland ( taken together ) have approximately 150,000 members . in the united states total membership is just under two million .
as of the first decade of the 21st century , contemporary neoclassical architecture is usually classed under the umbrella term of new classical architecture . sometimes it is also referred to as neo-historicism / revivalism , traditionalism or simply neoclassical architecture like the historical style . for sincere traditional-style architecture that sticks to regional architecture , materials and craftsmanship , the term traditional architecture ( or vernacular ) is mostly used . the driehaus architecture prize is awarded to major contributors in the field of 21st century traditional or classical architecture , and comes with a prize money twice as high as that of the modernist pritzker prize .
however , the formation of one 's identity occurs through one 's identifications with significant others ( primarily with parents and other individuals during one 's biographical experiences , and also with " groups " as they are perceived ) . these others may be benign - such that one aspires to their characteristics , values and beliefs ( a process of idealistic-identification ) , or malign - when one wishes to dissociate from their characteristics ( a process of defensive contra-identification ) ( weinreich & saunderson 2003 , chapter 1 , pp 54-61 ) .
in some team matches , only one entrant from each team may be designated as the " legal " or " active " wrestler at any given moment . two wrestlers must make physical contact ( typically palm-to-palm ) in order to transfer this legal status . this is known as a " tag , " with the participants " tagging out " and " tagging in . " typically the wrestler who is tagging out has a 5-second count to leave the ring , whereas the one tagging in can enter the ring at any time , resulting in heels legally double-teaming a face .
the son of an impoverished bedouin goat herder , gaddafi became involved in politics while at school in sabha , subsequently enrolling in the royal military academy , benghazi . founding a revolutionary cell within the military , in 1969 they seized power from the absolute monarchy of king idris in a bloodless coup . becoming chairman of the governing revolutionary command council ( rcc ) , gaddafi abolished the monarchy and proclaimed the republic . ruling by decree , he implemented measures to remove what he viewed as foreign imperialist influence from libya , and strengthened ties to arab nationalist governments . intent on pushing libya towards " islamic socialism , " he introduced sharia as the basis for the legal system and nationalized the oil industry , using the increased revenues to bolster the military , implement social programs and fund revolutionary militants across the world . in 1973 he initiated a " popular revolution " with the formation of general people 's committees ( gpcs ) , purported to be a system of direct democracy , but retained personal control over major decisions . he outlined his third international theory that year , publishing these ideas in the green book .
apart from being an ardent gamer spielberg has had a long history of involvement in video games . he has been giving thanks to his games of his division dreamworks interactive most notable as someone 's in the kitchen with script written by animaniacs ' paul rugg , goosebumps : escape from horrorland , the neverhood ( all in 1996 ) , skullmonkeys , dilbert 's desktop games , goosebumps : attack of the mutant ( all 1997 ) , boombots ( 1999 ) , t 'ai fu : wrath of the tiger ( 1999 ) , and clive barker 's undying ( 2001 ) . in 2005 the director signed with electronic arts to collaborate on three games including an action game and an award winning puzzle game for the wii called boom blox ( and its 2009 sequel : boom blox bash party ) . previously , he was involved in creating the scenario for the adventure game the dig . in 1996 , spielberg worked on and shot original footage for a movie-making simulation game called steven spielberg 's director 's chair . he is the creator of the medal of honor series by electronic arts . he is credited in the special thanks section of the 1998 video game trespasser . in 2013 , spielberg has announced he is collaborating with 343 industries for a live-action tv show of halo .
to qualify for participation in the auctions , banks must be able to offer proof of appropriate collateral in the form of loans to other entities . these can be the public debt of member states , but a fairly wide range of private banking securities are also accepted . the fairly stringent membership requirements for the european union , especially with regard to sovereign debt as a percentage of each member state 's gross domestic product , are designed to insure that assets offered to the bank as collateral are , at least in theory , all equally good , and all equally protected from the risk of inflation .
historical studies reveal that policing agents have undertaken a variety of cross-border police missions for many years ( deflem , 2002 ) . for example , in the 19th century a number of european policing agencies undertook cross-border surveillance because of concerns about anarchist agitators and other political radicals . a notable example of this was the occasional surveillance by prussian police of karl marx during the years he remained resident in london . the interests of public police agencies in cross-border co-operation in the control of political radicalism and ordinary law crime were primarily initiated in europe , which eventually led to the establishment of interpol before the second world war . there are also many interesting examples of cross-border policing under private auspices and by municipal police forces that date back to the 19th century ( nadelmann , 1993 ) . it has been established that modern policing has transgressed national boundaries from time to time almost from its inception . it is also generally agreed that in the post-cold war era this type of practice became more significant and frequent ( sheptycki , 2000 ) .
the success of the counter-reformation on the continent and the growth of a puritan party dedicated to further protestant reform polarised the elizabethan age . the early puritan movement was a movement for reform in the church of england . the desire was for the church of england to resemble more closely the protestant churches of europe , especially geneva . the later puritan movement , often referred to as dissenters and nonconformists , eventually led to the formation of various reformed denominations .
on 11 april 1951 , commander-in-chief truman relieved the controversial general macarthur , the supreme commander in korea . there were several reasons for the dismissal . macarthur had crossed the 38th parallel in the mistaken belief that the chinese would not enter the war , leading to major allied losses . he believed that whether or not to use nuclear weapons should be his own decision , not the president 's . macarthur threatened to destroy china unless it surrendered . while macarthur felt total victory was the only honorable outcome , truman was more pessimistic about his chances once involved in a land war in asia , and felt a truce and orderly withdrawal from korea could be a valid solution . macarthur was the subject of congressional hearings in may and june 1951 , which determined that he had defied the orders of the president and thus had violated the u.s. constitution . a popular criticism of macarthur was that he never spent a night in korea , and directed the war from the safety of tokyo .
at the time of her accession , the government was led by the whig prime minister lord melbourne , who at once became a powerful influence on the politically inexperienced queen , who relied on him for advice . charles greville supposed that the widowed and childless melbourne was " passionately fond of her as he might be of his daughter if he had one , " and victoria probably saw him as a father figure . her coronation took place on 28 june 1838 at westminster abbey . over 400,000 visitors came to london for the celebrations . she became the first sovereign to take up residence at buckingham palace and inherited the revenues of the duchies of lancaster and cornwall as well as being granted a civil list allowance of £ 385,000 per year . financially prudent , she paid off her father 's debts .
the 21 nocturnes are more structured , and of greater emotional depth , than those of field ( whom chopin met in 1833 ) . many of the chopin nocturnes have middle sections marked by agitated expression ( and often making very difficult demands on the performer ) which heightens their dramatic character .
since world war ii , aircraft carrier designs have increased in size to accommodate a steady increase in aircraft size . the large , modern nimitz class of us carriers has a displacement nearly four times that of the world war ii-era uss enterprise , yet its complement of aircraft is roughly the same - a consequence of the steadily increasing size and weight of military aircraft over the years . today 's aircraft carriers are so expensive that nations which operate them risk significant political , economic , and military impact if a carrier is lost , or even used in conflict .
a database management system ( dbms ) is a computer software application that interacts with the user , other applications , and the database itself to capture and analyze data . a general-purpose dbms is designed to allow the definition , creation , querying , update , and administration of databases . well-known dbmss include mysql , postgresql , microsoft sql server , oracle , sybase , sap hana , and ibm db2 . a database is not generally portable across different dbmss , but different dbms can interoperate by using standards such as sql and odbc or jdbc to allow a single application to work with more than one dbms . database management systems are often classified according to the database model that they support ; the most popular database systems since the 1980s have all supported the relational model as represented by the sql language . [ disputed - discuss ] sometimes a dbms is loosely referred to as a ' database ' .
few chinese had any illusions about japanese designs on china . hungry for raw materials and pressed by a growing population , japan initiated the seizure of manchuria in september 1931 and established ex-qing emperor puyi as head of the puppet state of manchukuo in 1932 . during the sino-japanese war ( 1937-1945 ) , the loss of manchuria , and its vast potential for industrial development and war industries , was a blow to the kuomintang economy . the league of nations , established at the end of world war i , was unable to act in the face of the japanese defiance . after 1940 , conflicts between the kuomintang and communists became more frequent in the areas not under japanese control . the communists expanded their influence wherever opportunities presented themselves through mass organizations , administrative reforms , and the land- and tax-reform measures favoring the peasants - while the kuomintang attempted to neutralize the spread of communist influence .
unfortunately for those who wanted or were required to wear green , there were no good vegetal green dyes which resisted washing and sunlight . green dyes were made out of the fern , plantain , buckthorn berries , the juice of nettles and of leeks , the digitalis plant , the broom plant , the leaves of the fraxinus , or ash tree , and the bark of the alder tree , but they rapidly faded or changed color . only in the 16th century was a good green dye produced , by first dyeing the cloth blue with woad , and then yellow with reseda luteola , also known as yellow-weed .
the state has the 12th-largest state economy in mexico , accounting for 2.7 % of the country 's gdp . chihuahua has the fifth highest manufacturing gdp in mexico and ranks second for the most factories funded by foreign investment in the country . as of 2011 [ update ] , the state had an estimated 396 billion pesos ( 31.1 billion dollars ) of annual gdp . according to official federal statistical studies , the service sector accounted for the largest portion of the state economy at 59.28 % ; the manufacturing and industrial sector is estimated to account for 34.36 % of the state 's gdp , with the agricultural sector accounting for 6.36 % of the state 's gdp . manufacturing sector was the principal foreign investment in the state followed by the mining sector . in 2011 , the state received approximately 884 million dollars in remittances from the united states , which was 4.5 % of all remittances from the united states to mexico .
the existence of literary and colloquial readings ( 文白異讀 ) , called tha  k-im ( 讀音 ) , is a prominent feature of some hokkien dialects and indeed in many sinitic varieties in the south . the bulk of literary readings ( 文讀 , bun-tha  k ) , based on pronunciations of the vernacular during the tang dynasty , are mainly used in formal phrases and written language ( e.g. philosophical concepts , surnames , and some place names ) , while the colloquial ( or vernacular ) ones ( 白讀 , pe  h-tha  k ) are basically used in spoken language and vulgar phrases . literary readings are more similar to the pronunciations of the tang standard of middle chinese than their colloquial equivalents .
today , lutheranism is one of the largest branches of protestantism . with approximately 80 million adherents , it constitutes the third most common protestant confession after historically pentecostal denominations and anglicanism . the lutheran world federation , the largest global communion of lutheran churches represents over 72 million people . additionally , there are also many smaller bodies such as the international lutheran council and the confessional evangelical lutheran conference , as well as independent churches .
there are at least 3,223 named lakes and reservoirs in montana , including flathead lake , the largest natural freshwater lake in the western united states . other major lakes include whitefish lake in the flathead valley and lake mcdonald and st. mary lake in glacier national park . the largest reservoir in the state is fort peck reservoir on the missouri river , which is contained by the second largest earthen dam and largest hydraulically filled dam in the world . other major reservoirs include hungry horse on the flathead river ; lake koocanusa on the kootenai river ; lake elwell on the marias river ; clark canyon on the beaverhead river ; yellowtail on the bighorn river , canyon ferry , hauser , holter , rainbow ; and black eagle on the missouri river .
many , if not most , birds migrate in flocks . for larger birds , flying in flocks reduces the energy cost . geese in a v-formation may conserve 12-20 % of the energy they would need to fly alone . red knots calidris canutus and dunlins calidris alpina were found in radar studies to fly 5 km / h ( 3.1 mph ) faster in flocks than when they were flying alone .
in 885 ad the armenians reestablished themselves as a sovereign kingdom under the leadership of ashot i of the bagratid dynasty . a considerable portion of the armenian nobility and peasantry fled the byzantine occupation of bagratid armenia in 1045 , and the subsequent invasion of the region by seljuk turks in 1064 . they settled in large numbers in cilicia , an anatolian region where armenians were already established as a minority since roman times . in 1080 , they founded an independent armenian principality then kingdom of cilicia , which became the focus of armenian nationalism . the armenians developed close social , cultural , military , and religious ties with nearby crusader states , but eventually succumbed to mamluk invasions . in the next few centuries , djenghis khan , timurids , and the tribal turkic federations of the ak koyunlu and the kara koyunlu ruled over the armenians .
the james river reaches tidewater at richmond where flooding may occur in every month of the year , most frequently in march and least in july . hurricanes and tropical storms have been responsible for most of the flooding during the summer and early fall months . hurricanes passing near richmond have produced record rainfalls . in 1955 , three hurricanes brought record rainfall to richmond within a six-week period . the most noteworthy of these were hurricane connie and hurricane diane that brought heavy rains five days apart . and in 2004 , the downtown area suffered extensive flood damage after the remnants of hurricane gaston dumped up to 12 inches ( 300 mm ) of rainfall .
while the new plebeian nobility made social , political and religious inroads on traditionally patrician preserves , their electorate maintained their distinctive political traditions and religious cults . during the punic crisis , popular cult to dionysus emerged from southern italy ; dionysus was equated with father liber , the inventor of plebeian augury and personification of plebeian freedoms , and with roman bacchus . official consternation at these enthusiastic , unofficial bacchanalia cults was expressed as moral outrage at their supposed subversion , and was followed by ferocious suppression . much later , a statue of marsyas , the silen of dionysus flayed by apollo , became a focus of brief symbolic resistance to augustus ' censorship . augustus himself claimed the patronage of venus and apollo ; but his settlement appealed to all classes . where loyalty was implicit , no divine hierarchy need be politically enforced ; liber 's festival continued .
the latin word templum originally referred not to the temple building itself , but to a sacred space surveyed and plotted ritually through augury : " the architecture of the ancient romans was , from first to last , an art of shaping space around ritual . " the roman architect vitruvius always uses the word templum to refer to this sacred precinct , and the more common latin words aedes , delubrum , or fanum for a temple or shrine as a building . the ruins of temples are among the most visible monuments of ancient roman culture .
in 1984 , he was appointed a member of the order of the companions of honour by queen elizabeth ii on the advice of prime minister margaret thatcher for his " services to the study of economics . " he was the first recipient of the hanns martin schleyer prize in 1984 . he also received the us presidential medal of freedom in 1991 from president george h. w. bush . in 2011 , his article " the use of knowledge in society " was selected as one of the top 20 articles published in the american economic review during its first 100 years .
in late 1994 , marvel acquired the comic book distributor heroes world distribution to use as its own exclusive distributor . as the industry 's other major publishers made exclusive distribution deals with other companies , the ripple effect resulted in the survival of only one other major distributor in north america , diamond comic distributors inc . in early 1997 , when marvel 's heroes world endeavor failed , diamond also forged an exclusive deal with marvel - giving the company its own section of its comics catalog previews .
in 1903 , after british victory in the anglo-boer war , swaziland became a british protectorate . much of its early administration ( for example , postal services ) being carried out from south africa until 1906 when the transvaal colony was granted self-government . following this , swaziland was partitioned into european and non-european ( or native reserves ) areas with the former being two-thirds of the total land . sobhuza 's official coronation was in december 1921 after the regency of labotsibeni after which he led an unsuccessful deputation to the privy council in london in 1922 regarding the issue of the land .
when auto-changing turntables were commonplace , records were typically pressed with a raised ( or ridged ) outer edge and a raised label area , allowing records to be stacked onto each other without the delicate grooves coming into contact , reducing the risk of damage . auto-changers included a mechanism to support a stack of several records above the turntable itself , dropping them one at a time onto the active turntable to be played in order . many longer sound recordings , such as complete operas , were interleaved across several 10-inch or 12-inch discs for use with auto-changing mechanisms , so that the first disk of a three-disk recording would carry sides 1 and 6 of the program , while the second disk would carry sides 2 and 5 , and the third , sides 3 and 4 , allowing sides 1 , 2 , and 3 to be played automatically ; then the whole stack reversed to play sides 4 , 5 , and 6 .
agriculture is dominated by the cultivation and sale of food crops such as cassava , peanuts , maize , sorghum , millet , sesame , and plantain . the annual real gdp growth rate is just above 3 % . the importance of food crops over exported cash crops is indicated by the fact that the total production of cassava , the staple food of most central africans , ranges between 200,000 and 300,000 tonnes a year , while the production of cotton , the principal exported cash crop , ranges from 25,000 to 45,000 tonnes a year . food crops are not exported in large quantities , but still constitute the principal cash crops of the country , because central africans derive far more income from the periodic sale of surplus food crops than from exported cash crops such as cotton or coffee . [ citation needed ] much of the country is self-sufficient in food crops ; however , livestock development is hindered by the presence of the tsetse fly . [ citation needed ]
the securitization markets supported by the shadow banking system started to close down in the spring of 2007 and nearly shut-down in the fall of 2008 . more than a third of the private credit markets thus became unavailable as a source of funds . according to the brookings institution , the traditional banking system does not have the capital to close this gap as of june 2009 : " it would take a number of years of strong profits to generate sufficient capital to support that additional lending volume . " the authors also indicate that some forms of securitization are " likely to vanish forever , having been an artifact of excessively loose credit conditions . "
on 20 april 1992 , the freddie mercury tribute concert was held at london 's wembley stadium to a 72,000-strong crowd . performers , including def leppard , robert plant , guns n ' roses , elton john , david bowie , george michael , annie lennox , seal , extreme , and metallica performed various queen songs along with the three remaining queen members ( and spike edney . ) the concert is listed in the guinness book of records as " the largest rock star benefit concert , " as it was televised to over 1.2 billion viewers worldwide , and raised over £ 20,000,000 for aids charities .
in 2006 , morgan stanley purchased 20 acres ( 8.1 ha ) directly north of the showboat atlantic city hotel and casino for a new $ 2 billion plus casino resort . revel entertainment group was named as the project 's developer for the revel casino . revel was hindered with many problems , with the biggest setback to the company being in april 2010 when morgan stanley , the owner of 90 % of revel entertainment group , decided to discontinue funding for continued construction and put its stake in revel up for sale . early in 2010 the new jersey state legislature passed a bill offering tax incentives to attract new investors and complete the job , but a poll by fairleigh dickinson university 's publicmind released in march 2010 showed that three of five voters ( 60 % ) opposed the legislation , and two of three of those who opposed it " strongly " opposed it . ultimately , governor chris christie offered revel $ 261 million in state tax credits to assist the casino once it opened . as of march 2011 [ update ] , revel had completed all of the exterior work and had continued work on the interior after finally receiving the funding necessary to complete construction . it had a soft opening in april 2012 , and was fully open by may 2012 . ten months later , in february 2013 , after serious losses and a write-down in the value of the resort from $ 2.4 billion to $ 450 million , revel filed for chapter 11 bankruptcy . it was restructured but still could not carry on and re-entered bankruptcy on june 19 , 2014 . it was put up for sale , however as no suitable bids were received the resort closed its doors on september 2 , 2014 .
before the french and indian war , the appalachian mountains laid on the indeterminate boundary between britain 's colonies along the atlantic and french areas centered in the mississippi basin . after the french and indian war , the proclamation of 1763 restricted settlement for great britain 's thirteen original colonies in north america to east of the summit line of the mountains ( except in the northern regions where the great lakes formed the boundary ) . although the line was adjusted several times to take frontier settlements into account and was impossible to enforce as law , it was strongly resented by backcountry settlers throughout the appalachians . the proclamation line can be seen as one of the grievances which led to the american revolutionary war . many frontier settlers held that the defeat of the french opened the land west of the mountains to english settlement , only to find settlement barred by the british king 's proclamation . the backcountry settlers who fought in the illinois campaign of george rogers clark were motivated to secure their settlement of kentucky .
as anticipated by nimitz , the japanese fleet arrived off midway on 4 june and was spotted by pby patrol aircraft . nagumo executed a first strike against midway , while fletcher launched his aircraft , bound for nagumo 's carriers . at 09 : 20 the first u.s. carrier aircraft arrived , tbd devastator torpedo bombers from hornet , but their attacks were poorly coordinated and ineffectual ; thanks in part to faulty aerial torpedoes , they failed to score a single hit and all 15 were wiped out by defending zero fighters . at 09 : 35 , 15 additional tbds from enterprise attacked in which 14 were lost , again with no hits . thus far , fletcher 's attacks had been disorganized and seemingly ineffectual , but they succeeded in drawing nagumo 's defensive fighters down to sea level where they expended much of their fuel and ammunition repulsing the two waves of torpedo bombers . as a result , when u.s. dive bombers arrived at high altitude , the zeros were poorly positioned to defend . to make matters worse , nagumo 's four carriers had drifted out of formation in their efforts to avoid torpedoes , reducing the concentration of their anti-aircraft fire . nagumo 's indecision had also created confusion aboard his carriers . alerted to the need of a second strike on midway , but also wary of the need to deal with the american carriers that he now knew were in the vicinity , nagumo twice changed the arming orders for his aircraft . as a result , the american dive bombers found the japanese carriers with their decks cluttered with munitions as the crews worked hastily to properly re-arm their air groups .
oklahoma city was settled on april 22 , 1889 , when the area known as the " unassigned lands " was opened for settlement in an event known as " the land run . " some 10,000 homesteaders settled the area that would become the capital of oklahoma . the town grew quickly ; the population doubled between 1890 and 1900 . early leaders of the development of the city included anton classen , john shartel , henry overholser and james w. maney .
a permanent european presence in new netherland began in 1624 - making new york the 12th oldest continuously occupied european-established settlement in the continental united states - with the founding of a dutch fur trading settlement on governors island . in 1625 , construction was started on a citadel and a fort amsterdam on manhattan island , later called new amsterdam ( nieuw amsterdam ) . the colony of new amsterdam was centered at the site which would eventually become lower manhattan . the dutch colonial director-general peter minuit purchased the island of manhattan from the canarsie , a small band of the lenape , in 1626 for a value of 60 guilders ( about $ 1000 in 2006 ) ; a disproved legend says that manhattan was purchased for $ 24 worth of glass beads .
in 1758 , the taxonomist linnaeus published in systema naturae a categorization of species which included the canis species . canis is a latin word meaning dog , and the list included the dog-like carnivores : the domestic dog , wolves , foxes and jackals . the dog was classified as canis familiaris , which means " dog-family " or the family dog . on the next page he recorded the wolf as canis lupus , which means " dog-wolf . " in 1978 , a review aimed at reducing the number of recognized canis species proposed that " canis dingo is now generally regarded as a distinctive feral domestic dog . canis familiaris is used for domestic dogs , although taxonomically it should probably be synonymous with canis lupus . " in 1982 , the first edition of mammal species of the world listed canis familiaris under canis lupus with the comment : " probably ancestor of and conspecific with the domestic dog , familiaris . canis familiaris has page priority over canis lupus , but both were published simultaneously in linnaeus ( 1758 ) , and canis lupus has been universally used for this species , " which avoided classifying the wolf as the family dog . the dog is now listed among the many other latin-named subspecies of canis lupus as canis lupus familiaris .
efforts have been made to improve nutrition , and reduce associated health problems , by encouraging women to make nutritious versions of local recipes . for example , the international crops research institute for the semi-arid tropics ( icrisat ) and the aga khan foundation , trained women 's groups to make equinut , a healthy and nutritional version of the traditional recipe di-degue ( comprising peanut paste , honey and millet or rice flour ) . the aim was to boost nutrition and livelihoods by producing a product that women could make and sell , and which would be accepted by the local community because of its local heritage .
on 16 june 2006 , it was announced that everton had entered into talks with knowsley council and tesco over the possibility of building a new 55,000 seat stadium , expandable to over 60,000 , in kirkby . the club took the unusual move of giving its supporters a say in the club 's future by holding a ballot on the proposal , finding a split of 59 % to 41 % in favour . opponents to the plan included other local councils concerned by the effect of a large tesco store being built as part of the development , and a group of fans demanding that everton should remain within the city boundaries of liverpool .
the story sees bond pitted against the global criminal organisation spectre , marking the group 's first appearance in an eon productions film since 1971 's diamonds are forever , [ n 2 ] and tying craig 's series of films together with an overarching storyline . several recurring james bond characters , including m , q and eve moneypenny return , with the new additions of lea seydoux as dr. madeleine swann , dave bautista as mr. hinx , andrew scott as max denbigh and monica bellucci as lucia sciarra .
capacitors may catastrophically fail when subjected to voltages or currents beyond their rating , or as they reach their normal end of life . dielectric or metal interconnection failures may create arcing that vaporizes the dielectric fluid , resulting in case bulging , rupture , or even an explosion . capacitors used in rf or sustained high-current applications can overheat , especially in the center of the capacitor rolls . capacitors used within high-energy capacitor banks can violently explode when a short in one capacitor causes sudden dumping of energy stored in the rest of the bank into the failing unit . high voltage vacuum capacitors can generate soft x-rays even during normal operation . proper containment , fusing , and preventive maintenance can help to minimize these hazards .
in the union of utrecht of 20 january 1579 , holland and zeeland were granted the right to accept only one religion ( in practice , calvinism ) . every other province had the freedom to regulate the religious question as it wished , although the union stated every person should be free in the choice of personal religion and that no person should be prosecuted based on religious choice . william of orange had been a strong supporter of public and personal freedom of religion and hoped to unite protestants and catholics in the new union , and , for him , the union was a defeat . in practice , catholic services in all provinces were quickly forbidden , and the reformed church became the " public " or " privileged " church in the republic .
although mali has enjoyed a reasonably good inter-ethnic relationships based on the long history of coexistence , some hereditary servitude and bondage relationship exist , as well as ethnic tension between settled songhai and nomadic tuaregs of the north . due to a backlash against the northern population after independence , mali is now in a situation where both groups complain about discrimination on the part of the other group . this conflict also plays a role in the continuing northern mali conflict where there is a tension between both tuaregs and the malian government , and the tuaregs and radical islamists who are trying to establish sharia law .
highlighting the potential for state and non-state actors to commit genocide in the 21st century , for example , in failed states or as non-state actors acquire weapons of mass destruction , adrian gallagher defined genocide as ' when a source of collective power ( usually a state ) intentionally uses its power base to implement a process of destruction in order to destroy a group ( as defined by the perpetrator ) , in whole or in substantial part , dependent upon relative group size ' . the definition upholds the centrality of intent , the multidimensional understanding of destroy , broadens the definition of group identity beyond that of the 1948 definition yet argues that a substantial part of a group has to be destroyed before it can be classified as genocide ( dependent on relative group size ) .
the mesolithic period in the indian subcontinent was followed by the neolithic period , when more extensive settlement of the subcontinent occurred after the end of the last ice age approximately 12,000 years ago . the first confirmed semipermanent settlements appeared 9,000 years ago in the bhimbetka rock shelters in modern madhya pradesh , india . early neolithic culture in south asia is represented by the bhirrana findings ( 7500 bce ) in haryana , india & mehrgarh findings ( 7000-9000 bce ) in balochistan , pakistan .
in 1936 , wever was killed in an air crash . the failure to implement his vision for the new luftwaffe was largely attributable to his immediate successors . ex-army personnel albert kesselring and hans-jurgen stumpff are usually blamed for the turning away from strategic planning and focusing on close air support . however , it would seem the two most prominent enthusiasts for the focus on ground-support operations ( direct or indirect ) were actually hugo sperrle and hans jeschonnek . these men were long-time professional airmen involved in german air services since early in their careers . the luftwaffe was not pressured into ground support operations because of pressure from the army , or because it was led by ex-army personnel . it was instead a mission that suited the luftwaffe 's existing approach to warfare ; a culture of joint inter-service operations , rather than independent strategic air campaigns .
the new york city police department ( nypd ) has been the largest police force in the united states by a significant margin , with over 35,000 sworn officers . members of the nypd are frequently referred to by politicians , the media , and their own police cars by the nickname , new york 's finest .
other than by appearance , " coloureds " can usually be distinguished from " blacks " by language . most speak afrikaans or english as a first language , as opposed to bantu languages such as zulu or xhosa . they also tend to have more european-sounding names than bantu names .
when a tree is very young it is covered with limbs almost , if not entirely , to the ground , but as it grows older some or all of them will eventually die and are either broken off or fall off . subsequent growth of wood may completely conceal the stubs which will however remain as knots . no matter how smooth and clear a log is on the outside , it is more or less knotty near the middle . consequently , the sapwood of an old tree , and particularly of a forest-grown tree , will be freer from knots than the inner heartwood . since in most uses of wood , knots are defects that weaken the timber and interfere with its ease of working and other properties , it follows that a given piece of sapwood , because of its position in the tree , may well be stronger than a piece of heartwood from the same tree .
the alps provide lowland europe with drinking water , irrigation , and hydroelectric power . although the area is only about 11 percent of the surface area of europe , the alps provide up to 90 percent of water to lowland europe , particularly to arid areas and during the summer months . cities such as milan depend on 80 percent of water from alpine runoff . water from the rivers is used in over 500 hydroelectricity power plants , generating as much as 2900 kilowatts of electricity .
judicial power - the power to decide cases and controversies - is vested in the supreme court and inferior courts established by congress . the judges must be appointed by the president with the advice and consent of the senate , hold office during good behavior and receive compensations that may not be diminished during their continuance in office . if a court 's judges do not have such attributes , the court may not exercise the judicial power of the united states . courts exercising the judicial power are called " constitutional courts .

old low franconian or old dutch is regarded as the primary stage in the development of a separate dutch language . the " low " in old low franconian refers to the frankish spoken in the low countries where it was not influenced by the high german consonant shift , as opposed to central and high franconian in germany . the latter would as a consequence evolve with allemanic into old high german . at more or less the same time the ingvaeonic nasal spirant law led to the development of old saxon , old frisian ( anglo-frisian ) and old english ( anglo-saxon ) . hardly influenced by either development , old dutch remained close to the original language of the franks , the people that would rule europe for centuries . the language however , did experienced developments on its own , like final-obstruent devoicing in a very early stage . in fact , by judging from the find at bergakker , it would seem that the language already experienced this characteristic during the old frankish period .

peace between england and the netherlands in 1688 meant that the two countries entered the nine years ' war as allies , but the conflict - waged in europe and overseas between france , spain and the anglo-dutch alliance - left the english a stronger colonial power than the dutch , who were forced to devote a larger proportion of their military budget on the costly land war in europe . the 18th century saw england ( after 1707 , britain ) rise to be the world 's dominant colonial power , and france becoming its main rival on the imperial stage .

nasser also attempted to maintain oversight of the country 's civil service to prevent it from inflating and consequently becoming a burden to the state . new laws provided workers with a minimum wage , profit shares , free education , free health care , reduced working hours , and encouragement to participate in management . land reforms guaranteed the security of tenant farmers , promoted agricultural growth , and reduced rural poverty . as a result of the 1962 measures , government ownership of egyptian business reached 51 percent , and the national union was renamed the arab socialist union ( asu ) . with these measures came more domestic repression , as thousands of islamists were imprisoned , including dozens of military officers . nasser 's tilt toward a soviet-style system led his aides boghdadi and hussein el-shafei to submit their resignations in protest .
the propagation of universities was not necessarily a steady progression , as the 17th century was rife with events that adversely affected university expansion . many wars , and especially the thirty years ' war , disrupted the university landscape throughout europe at different times . war , plague , famine , regicide , and changes in religious power and structure often adversely affected the societies that provided support for universities . internal strife within the universities themselves , such as student brawling and absentee professors , acted to destabilize these institutions as well . universities were also reluctant to give up older curricula , and the continued reliance on the works of aristotle defied contemporary advancements in science and the arts . this era was also affected by the rise of the nation-state . as universities increasingly came under state control , or formed under the auspices of the state , the faculty governance model ( begun by the university of paris ) became more and more prominent . although the older student-controlled universities still existed , they slowly started to move toward this structural organization . control of universities still tended to be independent , although university leadership was increasingly appointed by the state .

the division between the two is often not clear and is often politicized in disagreements within a government over a treaty , since a non-self-executing treaty cannot be acted on without the proper change in domestic law . if a treaty requires implementing legislation , a state may be in default of its obligations by the failure of its legislature to pass the necessary domestic laws .

port phillip is often warmer than the surrounding oceans and / or the land mass , particularly in spring and autumn ; this can set up a " bay effect " similar to the " lake effect " seen in colder climates where showers are intensified leeward of the bay . relatively narrow streams of heavy showers can often affect the same places ( usually the eastern suburbs ) for an extended period , while the rest of melbourne and surrounds stays dry . overall , melbourne is , owing to the rain shadow of the otway ranges , nonetheless drier than average for southern victoria . within the city and surrounds , however , rainfall varies widely , from around 425 millimetres ( 17 in ) at little river to 1,250 millimetres ( 49 in ) on the eastern fringe at gembrook . melbourne receives 48.6 clear days annually . dewpoint temperatures in the summer range from 9.5 ° c ( 49.1 ° f ) to 11.7 ° c ( 53.1 ° f ) .
over the course of ottoman history , the ottomans managed to build a large collection of libraries complete with translations of books from other cultures , as well as original manuscripts . a great part of this desire for local and foreign manuscripts arose in the 15th century . sultan mehmet ii ordered georgios amiroutzes , a greek scholar from trabzon , to translate and make available to ottoman educational institutions the geography book of ptolemy . another example is ali qushji -an astronomer , mathematician and physicist originally from samarkand- who became a professor in two madrasas , and influenced ottoman circles as a result of his writings and the activities of his students , even though he only spent two or three years before his death in istanbul .

the form of the verb varies with person ( first , second and third ) , number ( singular and plural ) , tense ( present and past ) , and mood ( indicative , subjunctive and imperative ) . old english also sometimes uses compound constructions to express other verbal aspects , the future and the passive voice ; in these we see the beginnings of the compound tenses of modern english . old english verbs include strong verbs , which form the past tense by altering the root vowel , and weak verbs , which use a suffix such as -de . as in modern english , and peculiar to the germanic languages , the verbs formed two great classes : weak ( regular ) , and strong ( irregular ) . like today , old english had fewer strong verbs , and many of these have over time decayed into weak forms . then , as now , dental suffixes indicated the past tense of the weak verbs , as in work and worked .
in addition to the cathedral , strasbourg houses several other medieval churches that have survived the many wars and destructions that have plagued the city : the romanesque eglise saint-etienne , partly destroyed in 1944 by allied bombing raids , the part romanesque , part gothic , very large eglise saint-thomas with its silbermann organ on which wolfgang amadeus mozart and albert schweitzer played , the gothic eglise protestante saint-pierre-le-jeune with its crypt dating back to the seventh century and its cloister partly from the eleventh century , the gothic eglise saint-guillaume with its fine early-renaissance stained glass and furniture , the gothic eglise saint-jean , the part gothic , part art nouveau eglise sainte-madeleine , etc . the neo-gothic church saint-pierre-le-vieux catholique ( there is also an adjacent church saint-pierre-le-vieux protestant ) serves as a shrine for several 15th-century wood worked and painted altars coming from other , now destroyed churches and installed there for public display . among the numerous secular medieval buildings , the monumental ancienne douane ( old custom-house ) stands out .
the federalist party of the united states was opposed by the democratic-republicans , including powerful figures such as thomas jefferson . the democratic-republicans mainly believed that : the legislature had too much power ( mainly because of the necessary and proper clause ) and that they were unchecked ; the executive had too much power , and that there was no check on the executive ; a dictator would arise ; and that a bill of rights should be coupled with the constitution to prevent a dictator ( then believed to eventually be the president ) from exploiting or tyrannizing citizens . the federalists , on the other hand , argued that it was impossible to list all the rights , and those that were not listed could be easily overlooked because they were not in the official bill of rights . rather , rights in specific cases were to be decided by the judicial system of courts .
before the attack on pearl harbor , the 800,000-member america first committee vehemently opposed any american intervention in the european conflict , even as america sold military aid to britain and the soviet union through the lend-lease program . opposition to war in the u.s. vanished after the attack . on 8 december , the united states , the united kingdom , canada , and the netherlands declared war on japan , followed by china and australia the next day . four days after pearl harbor , nazi germany and fascist italy declared war on the united states , drawing the country into a two-theater war . this is widely agreed to be a grand strategic blunder , as it abrogated the benefit germany gained by japan 's distraction of the u.s. ( predicted months before in a memo by commander arthur mccollum ) [ nb 12 ] and the reduction in aid to britain , which both congress and hitler had managed to avoid during over a year of mutual provocation , which would otherwise have resulted .
modern-day nigeria has been the site of numerous kingdoms and tribal states over the millennia . the modern state originated from british colonial rule beginning in the 19th century , and the merging of the southern nigeria protectorate and northern nigeria protectorate in 1914 . the british set up administrative and legal structures whilst practising indirect rule through traditional chiefdoms . nigeria became a formally independent federation in 1960 , and plunged into a civil war from 1967 to 1970 . it has since alternated between democratically-elected civilian governments and military dictatorships , until it achieved a stable democracy in 1999 , with its 2011 presidential elections being viewed as the first to be conducted reasonably freely and fairly .

darwin was hard at work on his " big book " on natural selection , when on 18 june 1858 he received a parcel from wallace , who stayed on the maluku islands ( ternate and gilolo ) . it enclosed twenty pages describing an evolutionary mechanism , a response to darwin 's recent encouragement , with a request to send it on to lyell if darwin thought it worthwhile . the mechanism was similar to darwin 's own theory . darwin wrote to lyell that " your words have come true with a vengeance , ... forestalled " and he would " of course , at once write and offer to send [ it ] to any journal " that wallace chose , adding that " all my originality , whatever it may amount to , will be smashed . " lyell and hooker agreed that a joint publication putting together wallace 's pages with extracts from darwin 's 1844 essay and his 1857 letter to gray should be presented at the linnean society , and on 1 july 1858 , the papers entitled on the tendency of species to form varieties ; and on the perpetuation of varieties and species by natural means of selection , by wallace and darwin respectively , were read out but drew little reaction . while darwin considered wallace 's idea to be identical to his concept of natural selection , historians have pointed out differences . darwin described natural selection as being analogous to the artificial selection practised by animal breeders , and emphasised competition between individuals ; wallace drew no comparison to selective breeding , and focused on ecological pressures that kept different varieties adapted to local conditions . some historians have suggested that wallace was actually discussing group selection rather than selection acting on individual variation .
imported mystery religions , which offered initiates salvation in the afterlife , were a matter of personal choice for an individual , practiced in addition to carrying on one 's family rites and participating in public religion . the mysteries , however , involved exclusive oaths and secrecy , conditions that conservative romans viewed with suspicion as characteristic of " magic , " conspiratorial ( coniuratio ) , or subversive activity . sporadic and sometimes brutal attempts were made to suppress religionists who seemed to threaten traditional morality and unity , as with the senate 's efforts to restrict the bacchanals in 186 bc .
with respect to pakistan 's territories ( i.e. fata , azad kashmir , northern areas and islamabad capital territory ( ict ) ) the supreme court 's jurisdiction is rather limited and varies from territory to territory ; it can hear appeals only of a constitutional nature from fata and northern areas , while ict generally functions the same as provinces . azad kashmir has its own courts system and the constitution of pakistan does not apply to it as such ; appeals from azad kashmir relate to its relationship with pakistan .
in 1911 arsphenamine , the first synthetic anti-infective drug , was developed by paul ehrlich and chemist alfred bertheim of the institute of experimental therapy in berlin . the drug was given the commercial name salvarsan . ehrlich , noting both the general toxicity of arsenic and the selective absorption of certain dyes by bacteria , hypothesized that an arsenic-containing dye with similar selective absorption properties could be used to treat bacterial infections . arsphenamine was prepared as part of a campaign to synthesize a series of such compounds , and found to exhibit partially selective toxicity . arsphenamine proved to be the first effective treatment for syphilis , a disease which prior to that time was incurable and led inexorably to severe skin ulceration , neurological damage , and death .

poetry is a form of literary art which uses aesthetic and rhythmic qualities of language to evoke meanings in addition to , or in place of , prosaic ostensible meaning . poetry has traditionally been distinguished from prose by its being set in verse ; [ a ] prose is cast in sentences , poetry in lines ; the syntax of prose is dictated by meaning , whereas that of poetry is held across metre or the visual aspects of the poem . prior to the nineteenth century , poetry was commonly understood to be something set in metrical lines ; accordingly , in 1658 a definition of poetry is " any kind of subject consisting of rythm or verses . " possibly as a result of aristotle 's influence ( his poetics ) , " poetry " before the nineteenth century was usually less a technical designation for verse than a normative category of fictive or rhetorical art . as a form it may pre-date literacy , with the earliest works being composed within and sustained by an oral tradition ; hence it constitutes the earliest example of literature .

the american bison is a large bovid which inhabited much of western north america prior to the 1800s , living on the prairies in large herds . however , the vast herds of bison attracted market hunters , who killed dozens of bison for their hides only , leaving the rest to rot . thousands of these hunters quickly eliminated the bison herds , bringing the population from several million in the early 1800s to a few hundred by the 1880s . conservation efforts have allowed the population to increase , but the bison remains near-threatened .
height limits in the melbourne cbd were lifted in 1958 , after the construction of ici house , transforming the city 's skyline with the introduction of skyscrapers . suburban expansion then intensified , serviced by new indoor malls beginning with chadstone shopping centre . the post-war period also saw a major renewal of the cbd and st kilda road which significantly modernised the city . new fire regulations and redevelopment saw most of the taller pre-war cbd buildings either demolished or partially retained through a policy of facadism . many of the larger suburban mansions from the boom era were also either demolished or subdivided .

neptune 's dark spots are thought to occur in the troposphere at lower altitudes than the brighter cloud features , so they appear as holes in the upper cloud decks . as they are stable features that can persist for several months , they are thought to be vortex structures . often associated with dark spots are brighter , persistent methane clouds that form around the tropopause layer . the persistence of companion clouds shows that some former dark spots may continue to exist as cyclones even though they are no longer visible as a dark feature . dark spots may dissipate when they migrate too close to the equator or possibly through some other unknown mechanism .
since then , tourism in nepal has thrived ; it is the country 's most important industry . [ citation needed ] tourism is a major source of income for most of the people in the city , with several hundred thousand visitors annually . hindu and buddhist pilgrims from all over the world visit kathmandu 's religious sites such as pashupatinath , swayambhunath , boudhanath and budhanilkantha . from a mere 6,179 tourists in 1961 / 62 , the number jumped to 491,504 in 1999 / 2000 . following the end of the maoist insurgency , there was a significant rise of 509,956 tourist arrivals in 2009 . since then , tourism has improved as the country turned into a democratic republic . in economic terms , the foreign exchange registered 3.8 % of the gdp in 1995 / 96 but then started declining [ why ? ] . the high level of tourism is attributed to the natural grandeur of the himalayas and the rich cultural heritage of the country .
in 1566 , the first police investigator of rio de janeiro was recruited . by the 17th century , most captaincies already had local units with law enforcement functions . on july 9 , 1775 a cavalry regiment was created in the state of minas gerais for maintaining law and order . in 1808 , the portuguese royal family relocated to brazil , because of the french invasion of portugal . king joao vi established the " intendencia geral de policia " ( general police intendancy ) for investigations . he also created a royal police guard for rio de janeiro in 1809 . in 1831 , after independence , each province started organizing its local " military police , " with order maintenance tasks . the federal railroad police was created in 1852 .
different cultures have evolved various ways of creating clothes out of cloth . one approach simply involves draping the cloth . many people wore , and still wear , garments consisting of rectangles of cloth wrapped to fit - for example , the dhoti for men and the sari for women in the indian subcontinent , the scottish kilt or the javanese sarong . the clothes may simply be tied up , as is the case of the first two garments ; or pins or belts hold the garments in place , as in the case of the latter two . the precious cloth remains uncut , and people of various sizes or the same person at different sizes can wear the garment .
brass , which is an alloy of copper and zinc , has been used since at least the 10th century bc in judea and by the 7th century bc in ancient greece . zinc metal was not produced on a large scale until the 12th century in india and was unknown to europe until the end of the 16th century . the mines of rajasthan have given definite evidence of zinc production going back to the 6th century bc . to date , the oldest evidence of pure zinc comes from zawar , in rajasthan , as early as the 9th century ad when a distillation process was employed to make pure zinc . alchemists burned zinc in air to form what they called " philosopher 's wool " or " white snow . "
another view , advanced by richard dawkins , is that the existence of god is an empirical question , on the grounds that " a universe with a god would be a completely different kind of universe from one without , and it would be a scientific difference . " carl sagan argued that the doctrine of a creator of the universe was difficult to prove or disprove and that the only conceivable scientific discovery that could disprove the existence of a creator would be the discovery that the universe is infinitely old .
seattle is widely considered one of the most liberal cities in the united states , even surpassing its neighbor , portland , oregon . support for issues such as same-sex marriage and reproductive rights are largely taken for granted in local politics . in the 2012 u.s. general election , an overwhelming majority of seattleites voted to approve referendum 74 and legalize gay marriage in washington state . in the same election , an overwhelming majority of seattleites also voted to approve the legalization of the recreational use of cannabis in the state . like much of the pacific northwest ( which has the lowest rate of church attendance in the united states and consistently reports the highest percentage of atheism ) , church attendance , religious belief , and political influence of religious leaders are much lower than in other parts of america .
in the 11th century , the seljuk turks took over much of the middle east , occupying persia during the 1040s , armenia in the 1060s , and jerusalem in 1070 . in 1071 , the turkish army defeated the byzantine army at the battle of manzikert and captured the byzantine emperor romanus iv ( r . 1068-71 ) . the turks were then free to invade asia minor , which dealt a dangerous blow to the byzantine empire by seizing a large part of its population and its economic heartland . although the byzantines regrouped and recovered somewhat , they never fully regained asia minor and were often on the defensive . the turks also had difficulties , losing control of jerusalem to the fatimids of egypt and suffering from a series of internal civil wars . the byzantines also faced a revived bulgaria , which in the late 12th and 13th centuries spread throughout the balkans .

physician valerius cordus ( 1515-1544 ) authored a botanically and pharmacologically important herbal historia plantarum in 1544 and a pharmacopoeia of lasting importance , the dispensatorium in 1546 . naturalist conrad von gesner ( 1516-1565 ) and herbalist john gerard ( 1545-c . 1611 ) published herbals covering the medicinal uses of plants . naturalist ulisse aldrovandi ( 1522-1605 ) was considered the father of natural history , which included the study of plants . in 1665 , using an early microscope , polymath robert hooke discovered cells , a term he coined , in cork , and a short time later in living plant tissue .
the " soft " ac format has reinvented in the late 2000s / early 2010s as a result of its declining relevance , adopting a more upmarket , middle-of-the-road approach , with a selection of " oldies " ( usually from the 1960s / 70s onwards ) , primarily rock , jazz , r & b and pop music . newer songs are more often ( but not limited to ) " easy listening " fare , this amount varying depending on the age of the station 's target demographic .
some 97 percent of male byu graduates and 32 percent of female graduates took a hiatus from their undergraduate studies at one point to serve as lds missionaries . in october 2012 , the lds church announced at its general conference that young men could serve a mission after they turn 18 and have graduated from high school , rather than after age 19 under the old policy . many young men would often attend a semester or two of higher education prior to beginning missionary service . this policy change will likely impact what has been the traditional incoming freshman class at byu . female students may now begin their missionary service anytime after turning 19 , rather than age 21 under the previous policy . for males , a full-time mission is two years in length , and for females it lasts 18 months .
throughout the following month , the yongle emperor and his court showered the karmapa with presents . at linggu temple in nanjing , he presided over the religious ceremonies for the yongle emperor 's deceased parents , while twenty-two days of his stay were marked by religious miracles that were recorded in five languages on a gigantic scroll that bore the emperor 's seal . during his stay in nanjing , deshin shekpa was bestowed the title " great treasure prince of dharma " by the yongle emperor . elliot sperling asserts that the yongle emperor , in bestowing deshin shekpa with the title of " king " and praising his mystical abilities and miracles , was trying to build an alliance with the karmapa as the mongols had with the sakya lamas , but deshin shekpa rejected the yongle emperor 's offer . in fact , this was the same title that kublai khan had offered the sakya phagpa lama , but deshin shekpa persuaded the yongle emperor to grant the title to religious leaders of other tibetan buddhist sects .
" data on ethnic groups are important for putting into effect a number of federal statutes ( i.e. , enforcing bilingual election rules under the voting rights act ; monitoring and enforcing equal employment opportunities under the civil rights act ) . data on ethnic groups are also needed by local governments to run programs and meet legislative requirements ( i.e. , identifying segments of the population who may not be receiving medical services under the public health act ; evaluating whether financial institutions are meeting the credit needs of minority populations under the community reinvestment act ) . "
these motors were originally invented to drive the capstan ( s ) of magnetic tape drives in the burgeoning computer industry , where minimal time to reach operating speed and minimal stopping distance were critical . pancake motors are still widely used in high-performance servo-controlled systems , robotic systems , industrial automation and medical devices . due to the variety of constructions now available , the technology is used in applications from high temperature military to low cost pump and basic servos .
two aspects of indigenous pre-hispanic culture that withstood time are chenchule ' and inafa 'maolek . chenchule ' is the intricate system of reciprocity at the heart of chamorro society . it is rooted in the core value of inafa 'maolek . historian lawrence cunningham in 1992 wrote , " in a chamorro sense , the land and its produce belong to everyone . inafa 'maolek , or interdependence , is the key , or central value , in chamorro culture ... inafa 'maolek depends on a spirit of cooperation and sharing . this is the armature , or core , that everything in chamorro culture revolves around . it is a powerful concern for mutuality rather than individualism and private property rights . "
he worked in street construction for a short amount of time , but was unable to cope with the heavy labour . continuing to attend university as a guest student , he started an apprenticeship as cabinetmaker , which he completed as a journeyman . he was dreaming at that time of starting a daycare facility for children , for which he assumed the ability to make furniture might be useful . after that he did voluntary service in one of psychoanalyst alfred adler 's clinics for children . in 1922 , he did his matura by way of a second chance education and finally joined the university as an ordinary student . he completed his examination as an elementary teacher in 1924 and started working at an after-school care club for socially endangered children . in 1925 , he went to the newly founded padagogisches institut and continued studying philosophy and psychology . around that time he started courting josefine anna henninger , who later became his wife .
in 1858 , the french emperor napoleon iii successfully gained the possession , in the name of the french government , of longwood house and the lands around it , last residence of napoleon i ( who died there in 1821 ) . it is still french property , administered by a french representative and under the authority of the french ministry of foreign affairs .
for less than a year between 1862-63 , peruvian ships , engaged in what became to be called the " blackbirding " trade , combed the smaller islands of polynesia from easter island in the eastern pacific to tuvalu and the southern atolls of the gilbert islands ( now kiribati ) , seeking recruits to fill the extreme labour shortage in peru . while some islanders were voluntary recruits the " blackbirders " were notorious for enticing islanders on to ships with tricks , such as pretending to be christian missionaries , as well as kidnapping islanders at gun point . the rev. a. w. murray , the earliest european missionary in tuvalu , reported that in 1863 about 170 people were taken from funafuti and about 250 were taken from nukulaelae , as there were fewer than 100 of the 300 recorded in 1861 as living on nukulaelae .
in the byzantine rite of the eastern orthodox church and the eastern catholic churches , the music performed in the liturgies is exclusively sung without instrumental accompaniment . bishop kallistos ware says , " the service is sung , even though there may be no choir ... in the orthodox church today , as in the early church , singing is unaccompanied and instrumental music is not found . " this a cappella behavior arises from strict interpretation of psalms 150 , which states , let every thing that hath breath praise the lord . praise ye the lord . in keeping with this philosophy , early russian musika which started appearing in the late 17th century , in what was known as khoroviye kontserti ( choral concertos ) made a cappella adaptations of venetian-styled pieces , such as the treatise , grammatika musikiyskaya ( 1675 ) , by nikolai diletsky . divine liturgies and western rite masses composed by famous composers such as peter tchaikovsky , sergei rachmaninoff , alexander arkhangelsky , and mykola leontovych are fine examples of this .
san diego and its backcountry are subject to periodic wildfires . in october 2003 , san diego was the site of the cedar fire , which has been called the largest wildfire in california over the past century . the fire burned 280,000 acres ( 1,100 km2 ) , killed 15 people , and destroyed more than 2,200 homes . in addition to damage caused by the fire , smoke resulted in a significant increase in emergency room visits due to asthma , respiratory problems , eye irritation , and smoke inhalation ; the poor air quality caused san diego county schools to close for a week . wildfires four years later destroyed some areas , particularly within the communities of rancho bernardo , rancho santa fe , and ramona .

popper claimed to have recognised already in the 1934 version of his logic of discovery a fact later stressed by kuhn , " that scientists necessarily develop their ideas within a definite theoretical framework , " and to that extent to have anticipated kuhn 's central point about " normal science . " ( but popper criticised what he saw as kuhn 's relativism . ) also , in his collection conjectures and refutations : the growth of scientific knowledge ( harper & row , 1963 ) , popper writes , " science must begin with myths , and with the criticism of myths ; neither with the collection of observations , nor with the invention of experiments , but with the critical discussion of myths , and of magical techniques and practices . the scientific tradition is distinguished from the pre-scientific tradition in having two layers . like the latter , it passes on its theories ; but it also passes on a critical attitude towards them . the theories are passed on , not as dogmas , but rather with the challenge to discuss them and improve upon them . "
serbo-croatian was standardized in the mid-19th-century vienna literary agreement by croatian and serbian writers and philologists , decades before a yugoslav state was established . from the very beginning , there were slightly different literary serbian and croatian standards , although both were based on the same shtokavian subdialect , eastern herzegovinian . in the 20th century , serbo-croatian served as the official language of the kingdom of yugoslavia ( when it was called " serbo-croato-slovenian " ) , and later as one of the official languages of the socialist federal republic of yugoslavia . the breakup of yugoslavia affected language attitudes , so that social conceptions of the language separated on ethnic and political lines . since the breakup of yugoslavia , bosnian has likewise been established as an official standard in bosnia and herzegovina , and there is an ongoing movement to codify a separate montenegrin standard . serbo-croatian thus generally goes by the ethnic names serbian , croatian , bosnian , and sometimes montenegrin and bunjevac .
martin luther , a german monk , started the german reformation by posting 95 theses on the castle church of wittenberg on october 31 , 1517 . the immediate provocation spurring this act was pope leo x 's renewal of the indulgence for the building of the new st. peter 's basilica in 1514 . luther was challenged to recant his heresy at the diet of worms in 1521 . when he refused , he was placed under the ban of the empire by charles v. receiving the protection of frederick the wise , he was then able to translate the bible into german .

around the start of the 20th century , a growing population of asian americans lived in or near santa monica and venice . a japanese fishing village was located near the long wharf while small numbers of chinese lived or worked in both santa monica and venice . the two ethnic minorities were often viewed differently by white americans who were often well-disposed towards the japanese but condescending towards the chinese . the japanese village fishermen were an integral economic part of the santa monica bay community .
besides the fibres , pulps may contain fillers such as chalk or china clay , which improve its characteristics for printing or writing . additives for sizing purposes may be mixed with it and / or applied to the paper web later in the manufacturing process ; the purpose of such sizing is to establish the correct level of surface absorbency to suit ink or paint .
in 2012 , news was released about a new farming site discovered in munam-ri , goseong , gangwon province , south korea , which may be the earliest farmland known to date in east asia . " no remains of an agricultural field from the neolithic period have been found in any east asian country before , the institute said , adding that the discovery reveals that the history of agricultural cultivation at least began during the period on the korean peninsula . " the farm was dated between 3600 and 3000 b.c. pottery , stone projectile points , and possible houses were also found . " in 2002 , researchers discovered prehistoric earthenware , jade earrings , among other items in the area . " the research team will perform accelerator mass spectrometry ( ams ) dating to retrieve a more precise date for the site .
there are three classes of components for oxide glasses : network formers , intermediates , and modifiers . the network formers ( silicon , boron , germanium ) form a highly cross-linked network of chemical bonds . the intermediates ( titanium , aluminium , zirconium , beryllium , magnesium , zinc ) can act as both network formers and modifiers , according to the glass composition . the modifiers ( calcium , lead , lithium , sodium , potassium ) alter the network structure ; they are usually present as ions , compensated by nearby non-bridging oxygen atoms , bound by one covalent bond to the glass network and holding one negative charge to compensate for the positive ion nearby . some elements can play multiple roles ; e.g. lead can act both as a network former ( pb4 + replacing si4 + ) , or as a modifier .
he does not argue that any such conclusions are therefore true , or that this describes the actual methods of any particular scientist . [ citation needed ] rather , it is recommended as an essential principle of methodology that , if enacted by a system or community , will lead to slow but steady progress of a sort ( relative to how well the system or community enacts the method ) . it has been suggested that popper 's ideas are often mistaken for a hard logical account of truth because of the historical co-incidence of their appearing at the same time as logical positivism , the followers of which mistook his aims for their own .
jerusalem with its many holy places probably had the highest concentration of mosaic-covered churches but very few of them survived the subsequent waves of destructions . the present remains do not do justice to the original richness of the city . the most important is the so-called " armenian mosaic " which was discovered in 1894 on the street of the prophets near damascus gate . it depicts a vine with many branches and grape clusters , which springs from a vase . populating the vine 's branches are peacocks , ducks , storks , pigeons , an eagle , a partridge , and a parrot in a cage . the inscription reads : " for the memory and salvation of all those armenians whose name the lord knows . " beneath a corner of the mosaic is a small , natural cave which contained human bones dating to the 5th or 6th centuries . the symbolism of the mosaic and the presence of the burial cave indicates that the room was used as a mortuary chapel .
during the 19th century , karl marx and friedrich engels extended the concept of materialism to elaborate a materialist conception of history centered on the roughly empirical world of human activity ( practice , including labor ) and the institutions created , reproduced , or destroyed by that activity ( see materialist conception of history ) . later marxists developed the notion of dialectical materialism which characterized later marxist philosophy and method .
other platings used are osp ( organic surface protectant ) , immersion silver ( iag ) , immersion tin , electroless nickel with immersion gold coating ( enig ) , electroless nickel electroless palladium immersion gold ( enepig ) and direct gold plating ( over nickel ) . edge connectors , placed along one edge of some boards , are often nickel plated then gold plated . another coating consideration is rapid diffusion of coating metal into tin solder . tin forms intermetallics such as cu5sn6 and ag3cu that dissolve into the tin liquidus or solidus ( @ 50c ) , stripping surface coating or leaving voids .
the israel museum in jerusalem is one of israel 's most important cultural institutions and houses the dead sea scrolls , along with an extensive collection of judaica and european art . israel 's national holocaust museum , yad vashem , is the world central archive of holocaust-related information . beth hatefutsoth ( the diaspora museum ) , on the campus of tel aviv university , is an interactive museum devoted to the history of jewish communities around the world . apart from the major museums in large cities , there are high-quality artspaces in many towns and kibbutzim . mishkan le 'omanut on kibbutz ein harod meuhad is the largest art museum in the north of the country .
this is a communication-based theory developed by howard m. weiss and russell cropanzano ( 1996 ) , that looks at the causes , structures , and consequences of emotional experience ( especially in work contexts ) . this theory suggests that emotions are influenced and caused by events which in turn influence attitudes and behaviors . this theoretical frame also emphasizes time in that human beings experience what they call emotion episodes - a " series of emotional states extended over time and organized around an underlying theme . " this theory has been utilized by numerous researchers to better understand emotion from a communicative lens , and was reviewed further by howard m. weiss and daniel j. beal in their article , " reflections on affective events theory , " published in research on emotion in organizations in 2005 .
letter case is often prescribed by the grammar of a language or by the conventions of a particular discipline . in orthography , the uppercase is primarily reserved for special purposes , such as the first letter of a sentence or of a proper noun , which makes the lowercase the more common variant in text . in mathematics , letter case may indicate the relationship between objects with uppercase letters often representing " superior " objects ( e.g. x could be a set containing the generic member x ) . engineering design drawings are typically labelled entirely in upper-case letters , which are easier to distinguish than lowercase , especially when space restrictions require that the lettering be small .
ibn sina ( avicenna ) is regarded as the most influential philosopher of islam . he pioneered the science of experimental medicine and was the first physician to conduct clinical trials . his two most notable works in medicine are the kitab al-shifaʾ ( " book of healing " ) and the canon of medicine , both of which were used as standard medicinal texts in both the muslim world and in europe well into the 17th century . amongst his many contributions are the discovery of the contagious nature of infectious diseases , and the introduction of clinical pharmacology .
finalist phillip phillips suffered from kidney pain and was taken to the hospital before the top 13 results show , and later received medical procedure to alleviate a blockage caused by kidney stones . he was reported to have eight surgeries during his idol run , and had considered quitting the show due to the pain . he underwent surgery to remove the stones and reconstruct his kidney soon after the season had finished .
in the 16th century , the ottoman empire and safavid empire divided armenia . from the early 16th century , both western armenia and eastern armenia fell under iranian safavid rule . owing to the century long turco-iranian geo-political rivalry that would last in western asia , significant parts of the region were frequently fought over between the two rivalling empires . from the mid 16th century with the peace of amasya , and decisively from the first half of the 17th century with the treaty of zuhab until the first half of the 19th century , eastern armenia was ruled by the successive iranian safavid , afsharid and qajar empires , while western armenia remained under ottoman rule .
it is possible to use the impedance matching concepts to construct vertical antennas substantially shorter than the 1 ⁄ 4 wavelength at which the antenna is resonant . by adding an inductance in series with the antenna , a so-called loading coil , the capacitive reactance of this antenna can be cancelled leaving a pure resistance which can then be matched to the transmission line . sometimes the resulting resonant frequency of such a system ( antenna plus matching network ) is described using the construct of electrical length and the use of a shorter antenna at a lower frequency than its resonant frequency is termed electrical lengthening .
122nd street is mentioned in the movie taxi driver by main character travis bickle as the location where a fellow cab driver is assaulted with a knife . the street and the surrounding neighborhood of harlem is then referred to as " mau mau land " by another character named wizard , slang indicating it is a majority black area .
" at 11 am petrus canisius van lierde as papal sacristan was at the bedside of the dying pope , ready to anoint him . the pope began to speak for the very last time : " i had the great grace to be born into a christian family , modest and poor , but with the fear of the lord . my time on earth is drawing to a close . but christ lives on and continues his work in the church . souls , souls , ut omnes unum sint . " [ c ] van lierde then anointed his eyes , ears , mouth , hands and feet . overcome by emotion , van lierde forgot the right order of anointing . john xxiii gently helped him before bidding those present a last farewell .
on saturday , july 23 , 1989 , much of america learned of the afl for an unintended reason , when the pittsburgh gladiators ' head coach , joe haering , made football history by punching commissioner jim foster during a game with the chicago bruisers . the national media ran with the story , including a photo in usa today . the game was played between the two teams in sacramento 's arco arena , as part of the afl 's ' barnstorming america ' tour . foster had walked onto the field of play to mediate an altercation between the two teams when haering , a former nfl assistant , punched him in the jaw . haering was suspended without pay .
society in the japanese " tokugawa period " ( edo society ) , unlike the shogunates before it , was based on the strict class hierarchy originally established by toyotomi hideyoshi . the daimyo , or lords , were at the top , followed by the warrior-caste of samurai , with the farmers , artisans , and traders ranking below . in some parts of the country , particularly smaller regions , daimyo and samurai were more or less identical , since daimyo might be trained as samurai , and samurai might act as local lords . otherwise , the largely inflexible nature of this social stratification system unleashed disruptive forces over time . taxes on the peasantry were set at fixed amounts which did not account for inflation or other changes in monetary value . as a result , the tax revenues collected by the samurai landowners were worth less and less over time . this often led to numerous confrontations between noble but impoverished samurai and well-to-do peasants , ranging from simple local disturbances to much bigger rebellions . none , however , proved compelling enough to seriously challenge the established order until the arrival of foreign powers .
melbourne 's cbd , compared with other australian cities , has comparatively unrestricted height limits and as a result of waves of post-war development contains five of the six tallest buildings in australia , the tallest of which is the eureka tower , situated in southbank . it has an observation deck near the top from where you can see above all of melbourne 's structures . the rialto tower , the city 's second tallest , remains the tallest building in the old cbd ; its observation deck for visitors has recently closed .
russian imperialism led to the russian empire 's conquest of central asia during the late 19th century 's imperial era . between 1864 and 1885 russia gradually took control of the entire territory of russian turkestan , the tajikistan portion of which had been controlled by the emirate of bukhara and khanate of kokand . russia was interested in gaining access to a supply of cotton and in the 1870s attempted to switch cultivation in the region from grain to cotton ( a strategy later copied and expanded by the soviets ) . [ citation needed ] by 1885 tajikistan 's territory was either ruled by the russian empire or its vassal state , the emirate of bukhara , nevertheless tajiks felt little russian influence .

as the summit closed on 28 september 1970 , hours after escorting the last arab leader to leave , nasser suffered a heart attack . he was immediately transported to his house , where his physicians tended to him . nasser died several hours later , around 6 : 00 p.m. heikal , sadat , and nasser 's wife tahia were at his deathbed . according to his doctor , al-sawi habibi , nasser 's likely cause of death was arteriosclerosis , varicose veins , and complications from long-standing diabetes . nasser was a heavy smoker with a family history of heart disease - two of his brothers died in their fifties from the same condition . the state of nasser 's health was not known to the public prior to his death . he had previously suffered heart attacks in 1966 and september 1969 .
in 1926 , universal opened a production unit in germany , deutsche universal-film ag , under the direction of joe pasternak . this unit produced three to four films per year until 1936 , migrating to hungary and then austria in the face of hitler 's increasing domination of central europe . with the advent of sound , these productions were made in the german language or , occasionally , hungarian or polish . in the u.s. , universal pictures did not distribute any of this subsidiary 's films , but at least some of them were exhibited through other , independent , foreign-language film distributors based in new york , without benefit of english subtitles . nazi persecution and a change in ownership for the parent universal pictures organization resulted in the dissolution of this subsidiary .
london is home to five major medical schools - barts and the london school of medicine and dentistry ( part of queen mary ) , king 's college london school of medicine ( the largest medical school in europe ) , imperial college school of medicine , ucl medical school and st george 's , university of london - and has a large number of affiliated teaching hospitals . it is also a major centre for biomedical research , and three of the uk 's five academic health science centres are based in the city - imperial college healthcare , king 's health partners and ucl partners ( the largest such centre in europe ) .
the metal 's distinctive natural green patina has long been coveted by architects and designers . the final patina is a particularly durable layer that is highly resistant to atmospheric corrosion , thereby protecting the underlying metal against further weathering . it can be a mixture of carbonate and sulfate compounds in various amounts , depending upon environmental conditions such as sulfur-containing acid rain . architectural copper and its alloys can also be ' finished ' to embark a particular look , feel , and / or color . finishes include mechanical surface treatments , chemical coloring , and coatings .
science came to play a leading role in enlightenment discourse and thought . many enlightenment writers and thinkers had backgrounds in the sciences and associated scientific advancement with the overthrow of religion and traditional authority in favour of the development of free speech and thought . scientific progress during the enlightenment included the discovery of carbon dioxide ( fixed air ) by the chemist joseph black , the argument for deep time by the geologist james hutton , and the invention of the steam engine by james watt . the experiments of lavoisier were used to create the first modern chemical plants in paris , and the experiments of the montgolfier brothers enabled them to launch the first manned flight in a hot-air balloon on 21 november 1783 , from the chateau de la muette , near the bois de boulogne .
a weather phenomenon known as the fohn ( with an identical effect to the chinook wind ) can occur at all times of the year and is characterised by an unexpectedly warm wind , bringing air of very low relative humidity to the north of the alps during rainfall periods on the southern face of the alps . this works both ways across the alps but is more efficient if blowing from the south due to the steeper step for oncoming wind from the south . valleys running south to north trigger the best effect . the driest conditions persist in all inner alpine valleys that receive less rain because arriving clouds lose a lot of their content while crossing the mountains before reaching these areas . large alpine areas such as graubunden remain drier than pre-alpine areas and as in the main valley of the valais wine grapes are grown there .
in january 2013 , destiny 's child released love songs , a compilation album of the romance-themed songs from their previous albums and a newly recorded track , " nuclear . " beyonce performed the american national anthem singing along with a pre-recorded track at president obama 's second inauguration in washington , d.c. the following month , beyonce performed at the super bowl xlvii halftime show , held at the mercedes-benz superdome in new orleans . the performance stands as the second most tweeted about moment in history at 268,000 tweets per minute . at the 55th annual grammy awards , beyonce won for best traditional r & b performance for " love on top . " her feature-length documentary film , life is but a dream , first aired on hbo on february 16 , 2013 . the film , which she directed and produced herself , featured footage from her childhood , her as a mother and businesswoman , recording , rehearsing for live performances , and her return to the spotlight following blue ivy 's birth . its dvd release in november 2013 was accompanied by footage from the revel presents : beyonce live concerts and a new song , " god made you beautiful . " in february 2013 , beyonce signed a global publishing agreement with warner / chappell music , which would cover her future songwriting and then-upcoming studio album .
world war ii holds a special place in the american psyche as the country 's greatest triumph , and the u.s. military personnel of world war ii are frequently referred to as " the greatest generation . " over 16 million served ( about 11 % of the population ) , and over 400,000 died during the war . the u.s. emerged as one of the two undisputed superpowers along with the soviet union , and unlike the soviet union , the u.s. homeland was virtually untouched by the ravages of war . during and following world war ii , the united states and britain developed an increasingly strong defense and intelligence relationship . manifestations of this include extensive basing of u.s. forces in the uk , shared intelligence , shared military technology ( e.g. nuclear technology ) , and shared procurement .
as the number of possible tests for even simple software components is practically infinite , all software testing uses some strategy to select tests that are feasible for the available time and resources . as a result , software testing typically ( but not exclusively ) attempts to execute a program or application with the intent of finding software bugs ( errors or other defects ) . the job of testing is an iterative process as when one bug is fixed , it can illuminate other , deeper bugs , or can even create new ones .
some of the second-generation renewables , such as wind power , have high potential and have already realised relatively low production costs . global wind power installations increased by 35,800 mw in 2010 , bringing total installed capacity up to 194,400 mw , a 22.5 % increase on the 158,700 mw installed at the end of 2009 . the increase for 2010 represents investments totalling € 47.3 billion ( us $ 65 billion ) and for the first time more than half of all new wind power was added outside of the traditional markets of europe and north america , mainly driven , by the continuing boom in china which accounted for nearly half of all of the installations at 16,500 mw . china now has 42,300 mw of wind power installed . wind power accounts for approximately 19 % of electricity generated in denmark , 9 % in spain and portugal , and 6 % in germany and the republic of ireland . in australian state of south australia wind power , championed by premier mike rann ( 2002-2011 ) , now comprises 26 % of the state 's electricity generation , edging out coal fired power . at the end of 2011 south australia , with 7.2 % of australia 's population , had 54 % of the nation 's installed wind power capacity . wind power 's share of worldwide electricity usage at the end of 2014 was 3.1 % . these are some of the largest wind farms in the world :
mary 's complete sinlessness and concomitant exemption from any taint from the first moment of her existence was a doctrine familiar to greek theologians of byzantium . beginning with st. gregory nazianzen , his explanation of the " purification " of jesus and mary at the circumcision ( luke 2 : 22 ) prompted him to consider the primary meaning of " purification " in christology ( and by extension in mariology ) to refer to a perfectly sinless nature that manifested itself in glory in a moment of grace ( e.g. , jesus at his baptism ) . st. gregory nazianzen designated mary as " prokathartheisa ( prepurified ) . " gregory likely attempted to solve the riddle of the purification of jesus and mary in the temple through considering the human natures of jesus and mary as equally holy and therefore both purified in this manner of grace and glory . gregory 's doctrines surrounding mary 's purification were likely related to the burgeoning commemoration of the mother of god in and around constantinople very close to the date of christmas . nazianzen 's title of mary at the annunciation as " prepurified " was subsequently adopted by all theologians interested in his mariology to justify the byzantine equivalent of the immaculate conception . this is especially apparent in the fathers st. sophronios of jerusalem and st. john damascene , who will be treated below in this article at the section on church fathers . about the time of damascene , the public celebration of the " conception of st. ann [ i.e. , of the theotokos in her womb ] " was becoming popular . after this period , the " purification " of the perfect natures of jesus and mary would not only mean moments of grace and glory at the incarnation and baptism and other public byzantine liturgical feasts , but purification was eventually associated with the feast of mary 's very conception ( along with her presentation in the temple as a toddler ) by orthodox authors of the 2nd millennium ( e.g. , st. nicholas cabasilas and joseph bryennius ) .
although the catholics and the orthodox may honor and venerate mary , they do not view her as divine , nor do they worship her . roman catholics view mary as subordinate to christ , but uniquely so , in that she is seen as above all other creatures . similarly theologian sergei bulgakov wrote that the orthodox view mary as " superior to all created beings " and " ceaselessly pray for her intercession . " however , she is not considered a " substitute for the one mediator " who is christ . " let mary be in honor , but let worship be given to the lord , " he wrote . similarly , catholics do not worship mary as a divine being , but rather " hyper-venerate " her . in roman catholic theology , the term hyperdulia is reserved for marian veneration , latria for the worship of god , and dulia for the veneration of other saints and angels . the definition of the three level hierarchy of latria , hyperdulia and dulia goes back to the second council of nicaea in 787 .
hebb distinguished between short-term and long-term memory . he postulated that any memory that stayed in short-term storage for a long enough time would be consolidated into a long-term memory . later research showed this to be false . research has shown that direct injections of cortisol or epinephrine help the storage of recent experiences . this is also true for stimulation of the amygdala . this proves that excitement enhances memory by the stimulation of hormones that affect the amygdala . excessive or prolonged stress ( with prolonged cortisol ) may hurt memory storage . patients with amygdalar damage are no more likely to remember emotionally charged words than nonemotionally charged ones . the hippocampus is important for explicit memory . the hippocampus is also important for memory consolidation . the hippocampus receives input from different parts of the cortex and sends its output out to different parts of the brain also . the input comes from secondary and tertiary sensory areas that have processed the information a lot already . hippocampal damage may also cause memory loss and problems with memory storage . this memory loss includes , retrograde amnesia which is the loss of memory for events that occurred shortly before the time of brain damage .
frederic francois chopin ( / ˈʃoʊpæn / ; french pronunciation : [ fʁe.de.ʁik fʁɑ  .swa ʃɔ.pɛ  ] ; 22 february or 1 march 1810 - 17 october 1849 ) , born fryderyk franciszek chopin , [ n 1 ] was a polish and french ( by citizenship and birth of father ) composer and a virtuoso pianist of the romantic era , who wrote primarily for the solo piano . he gained and has maintained renown worldwide as one of the leading musicians of his era , whose " poetic genius was based on a professional technique that was without equal in his generation . " chopin was born in what was then the duchy of warsaw , and grew up in warsaw , which after 1815 became part of congress poland . a child prodigy , he completed his musical education and composed his earlier works in warsaw before leaving poland at the age of 20 , less than a month before the outbreak of the november 1830 uprising .
by the early 2000s , laserdisc was completely replaced by dvd in the north american retail marketplace , as neither players nor software were then produced . players were still exported to north america from japan until the end of 2001 . the format has retained some popularity among american collectors , and to a greater degree in japan , where the format was better supported and more prevalent during its life . in europe , laserdisc always remained an obscure format . it was chosen by the british broadcasting corporation ( bbc ) for the bbc domesday project in the mid-1980s , a school-based project to commemorate 900 years since the original domesday book in england . from 1991 up until the early 2000s , the bbc also used laserdisc technology to play out the channel idents .
much of tucson 's economic development has been centered on the development of the university of arizona , which is currently the second largest employer in the city . davis-monthan air force base , located on the southeastern edge of the city , also provides many jobs for tucson residents . its presence , as well as the presence of the us army intelligence center ( fort huachuca , the largest employer in the region in nearby sierra vista ) , has led to the development of a significant number of high-tech industries , including government contractors , in the area . the city of tucson is also a major hub for the union pacific railroad 's sunset route that links the los angeles ports with the south / southeast regions of the country .
as of 2010 [ update ] , bern had an unemployment rate of 3.3 % . as of 2008 [ update ] , there were 259 people employed in the primary economic sector and about 59 businesses involved in this sector . 16,413 people were employed in the secondary sector and there were 950 businesses in this sector . 135,973 people were employed in the tertiary sector , with 7,654 businesses in this sector .
beginning around 2005 , drug traffickers based in latin america began to use guinea-bissau , along with several neighboring west african nations , as a transshipment point to europe for cocaine . the nation was described by a united nations official as being at risk for becoming a " narco-state . " the government and the military have done little to stop drug trafficking , which increased after the 2012 coup d 'etat .
the war on terrorism is a global effort by the governments of several countries ( primarily the united states and its principal allies ) to neutralize international terrorist groups ( primarily islamic extremist terrorist groups , including al-qaeda ) and ensure that countries considered by the us and some of its allies to be rogue nations no longer support terrorist activities . it has been adopted primarily as a response to the september 11 , 2001 attacks on the united states . since 2001 , terrorist motivated attacks upon service members have occurred in arkansas and texas .
there has been an increasing gulf between the premier league and the football league . since its split with the football league , many established clubs in the premier league have managed to distance themselves from their counterparts in lower leagues . owing in large part to the disparity in revenue from television rights between the leagues , many newly promoted teams have found it difficult to avoid relegation in their first season in the premier league . in every season except 2001-02 and 2011-12 , at least one premier league newcomer has been relegated back to the football league . in 1997-98 all three promoted clubs were relegated at the end of the season .
china daily , a ccp-controlled news organization since 1981 , states in a 2008 article that although there were dynastic changes after tibet was incorporated into the territory of yuan dynasty 's china in the 13th century , " tibet has remained under the jurisdiction of the central government of china . " it also states that the ming dynasty " inherited the right to rule tibet " from the yuan dynasty , and repeats the claims in the mingshi about the ming establishing two itinerant high commands over tibet . china daily states that the ming handled tibet 's civil administration , appointed all leading officials of these administrative organs , and punished tibetans who broke the law . the party-controlled people 's daily , the state-controlled xinhua news agency , and the state-controlled national television network china central television posted the same article that china daily had , the only difference being their headlines and some additional text .
solar concentrating technologies such as parabolic dish , trough and scheffler reflectors can provide process heat for commercial and industrial applications . the first commercial system was the solar total energy project ( step ) in shenandoah , georgia , usa where a field of 114 parabolic dishes provided 50 % of the process heating , air conditioning and electrical requirements for a clothing factory . this grid-connected cogeneration system provided 400 kw of electricity plus thermal energy in the form of 401 kw steam and 468 kw chilled water , and had a one-hour peak load thermal storage . evaporation ponds are shallow pools that concentrate dissolved solids through evaporation . the use of evaporation ponds to obtain salt from sea water is one of the oldest applications of solar energy . modern uses include concentrating brine solutions used in leach mining and removing dissolved solids from waste streams . clothes lines , clotheshorses , and clothes racks dry clothes through evaporation by wind and sunlight without consuming electricity or gas . in some states of the united states legislation protects the " right to dry " clothes . unglazed transpired collectors ( utc ) are perforated sun-facing walls used for preheating ventilation air . utcs can raise the incoming air temperature up to 22 ° c ( 40 ° f ) and deliver outlet temperatures of 45-60 ° c ( 113-140 ° f ) . the short payback period of transpired collectors ( 3 to 12 years ) makes them a more cost-effective alternative than glazed collection systems . as of 2003 , over 80 systems with a combined collector area of 35,000 square metres ( 380,000 sq ft ) had been installed worldwide , including an 860 m2 ( 9,300 sq ft ) collector in costa rica used for drying coffee beans and a 1,300 m2 ( 14,000 sq ft ) collector in coimbatore , india , used for drying marigolds .
in 1974 , the unmanned astroflight sunrise plane made the first solar flight . on 29 april 1979 , the solar riser made the first flight in a solar-powered , fully controlled , man carrying flying machine , reaching an altitude of 40 feet ( 12 m ) . in 1980 , the gossamer penguin made the first piloted flights powered solely by photovoltaics . this was quickly followed by the solar challenger which crossed the english channel in july 1981 . in 1990 eric scott raymond in 21 hops flew from california to north carolina using solar power . developments then turned back to unmanned aerial vehicles ( uav ) with the pathfinder ( 1997 ) and subsequent designs , culminating in the helios which set the altitude record for a non-rocket-propelled aircraft at 29,524 metres ( 96,864 ft ) in 2001 . the zephyr , developed by bae systems , is the latest in a line of record-breaking solar aircraft , making a 54-hour flight in 2007 , and month-long flights were envisioned by 2010 . as of 2015 , solar impulse , an electric aircraft , is currently circumnavigating the globe . it is a single-seat plane powered by solar cells and capable of taking off under its own power . the designed allows the aircraft to remain airborne for 36 hours .
although older german loanwords were colloquial , recent borrowings from other languages are associated with high culture . during the nineteenth century , words with greek and latin roots were rejected in favor of those based on older czech words and common slavic roots ; " music " is muzyka in polish and музыка ( muzyka ) in russian , but in czech it is hudba . some czech words have been borrowed as loanwords into english and other languages - for example , robot ( from robota , " labor " ) and polka ( from polka , " polish woman " or from " pulka " " half " ) .
on 11 april 2006 , brian may and roger taylor appeared on the american singing contest television show american idol . each contestant was required to sing a queen song during that week of the competition . songs which appeared on the show included " bohemian rhapsody , " " fat bottomed girls , " " the show must go on , " " who wants to live forever , " and " innuendo . " brian may later criticised the show for editing specific scenes , one of which made the group 's time with contestant ace young look negative , despite it being the opposite . taylor and may again appeared on the american idol season 8 finale in may 2009 , performing " we are the champions " with finalists adam lambert and kris allen . on 15 november 2009 , brian may and roger taylor appeared on the singing contest television show x factor in the uk .
in 2000 , the five most common self-reported ethnic groups in the state were : american ( 17.3 % ) , african american ( 13.0 % ) , irish ( 9.3 % ) , english ( 9.1 % ) , and german ( 8.3 % ) . most tennesseans who self-identify as having american ancestry are of english and scotch-irish ancestry . an estimated 21-24 % of tennesseans are of predominantly english ancestry . in the 1980 census 1,435,147 tennesseans claimed " english " or " mostly english " ancestry out of a state population of 3,221,354 making them 45 % of the state at the time .
as of 2013 , the global advertising agencies of omnicom group and interpublic group , both based in manhattan , had combined annual revenues of approximately us $ 21 billion , reflecting new york city 's role as the top global center for the advertising industry , which is metonymously referred to as " madison avenue . " the city 's fashion industry provides approximately 180,000 employees with $ 11 billion in annual wages .
monastic reform became an important issue during the 11th century , as elites began to worry that monks were not adhering to the rules binding them to a strictly religious life . cluny abbey , founded in the macon region of france in 909 , was established as part of the cluniac reforms , a larger movement of monastic reform in response to this fear . cluny quickly established a reputation for austerity and rigour . it sought to maintain a high quality of spiritual life by placing itself under the protection of the papacy and by electing its own abbot without interference from laymen , thus maintaining economic and political independence from local lords .
in the netherlands , the supreme court of the netherlands is the highest . its decisions , known as " arresten , " are absolutely final . the court is banned from testing legislation against the constitution , pursuant to the principle of the sovereignty of the states-general ; the court can , however , test legislation against some treaties . also , the ordinary courts in the netherlands , including the hoge raad , do not deal with administrative law , which is dealt with in separate administrative courts , the highest of which is the council of state ( raad van state )
the british isles are a group of islands off the north-western coast of continental europe that consist of the islands of great britain , ireland and over six thousand smaller isles . situated in the north atlantic , the islands have a total area of approximately 315,159 km2 , and a combined population of just under 70 million . two sovereign states are located on the islands : ireland ( which covers roughly five-sixths of the island with the same name ) and the united kingdom of great britain and northern ireland . the british isles also include three crown dependencies : the isle of man and , by tradition , the bailiwick of jersey and the bailiwick of guernsey in the channel islands , although the latter are not physically a part of the archipelago .
over the course of the 20th century , the world 's per-capita gross domestic product grew by a factor of five , much more than all earlier centuries combined ( including the 19th with its industrial revolution ) . many economists make the case that this understates the magnitude of growth , as many of the goods and services consumed at the end of the 20th century , such as improved medicine ( causing world life expectancy to increase by more than two decades ) and communications technologies , were not available at any price at its beginning . however , the gulf between the world 's rich and poor grew wider , and the majority of the global population remained in the poor side of the divide .
on 7 july 1994 , the fraunhofer society released the first software mp3 encoder called l3enc . the filename extension .mp3 was chosen by the fraunhofer team on 14 july 1995 ( previously , the files had been named .bit ) . with the first real-time software mp3 player winplay3 ( released 9 september 1995 ) many people were able to encode and play back mp3 files on their pcs . because of the relatively small hard drives back in that time ( ~ 500-1000 mb ) lossy compression was essential to store non-instrument based ( see tracker and midi ) music for playback on computer .
throughout her career madonna has been involved in writing and producing most of her own music . madonna 's early songwriting skill was developed during her time with the breakfast club in 1979 . according to author carol gnojewski , her first attempts at songwriting are perceived as an important self-revelation , as madonna said : " i don 't know where [ the songs ] came from . it was like magic . i 'd write a song every day . i said ' wow , i was meant to do this ' . " mark kamins , her first producer , believed that madonna is " a much underrated musician and lyricist . " rolling stone has named her " an exemplary songwriter with a gift for hooks and indelible lyrics . " according to freya jarman-ivens , madonna 's talent for developing " incredible " hooks for her songs allows the lyrics to capture the attention of the audience , even without the influence of the music . as an example , jarman-ivens cites the 1985 single " into the groove " and its line " live out your fantasy here with me , just let the music set you free ; touch my body , and move in time , now i know you 're mine . " madonna 's songwriting are often autobiographical over the years , dealing with various themes from love and relationships to self-respect and female empowerment . her songs also speak about taboo and unconventional issues of their period , such as sexuality and aids on erotica ( 1992 ) . many of her lyrics contain innuendos and double entendre , which lead to multiple interpretations among music critics and scholars . madonna has been nominated for being inducted into the songwriters hall of fame twice , for 2014 and 2016 ceremony . rolling stone listed madonna at number 56 on the " 100 greatest songwriters of all time . "
greek citizens who are roman catholic are estimated to be at around 50,000 with the roman catholic immigrant community in the country approximately 200,000 . old calendarists account for 500,000 followers . protestants , including greek evangelical church and free evangelical churches , stand at about 30,000 . assemblies of god , international church of the foursquare gospel and other pentecostal churches of the greek synod of apostolic church have 12,000 members . independent free apostolic church of pentecost is the biggest protestant denomination in greece with 120 churches . there are not official statistics about free apostolic church of pentecost , but the orthodox church estimates the followers as 20,000 . the jehovah 's witnesses report having 28,874 active members . in recent years there has been a small-scale revival of the ancient greek religion , with estimates of 2,000 people active practitioners , and 100,000 " sympathisers .

the immediate predecessors of mp3 were " optimum coding in the frequency domain " ( ocf ) , and perceptual transform coding ( pxfm ) . these two codecs , along with block-switching contributions from thomson-brandt , were merged into a codec called aspec , which was submitted to mpeg , and which won the quality competition , but that was mistakenly rejected as too complex to implement . the first practical implementation of an audio perceptual coder ( ocf ) in hardware ( krasner 's hardware was too cumbersome and slow for practical use ) , was an implementation of a psychoacoustic transform coder based on motorola 56000 dsp chips .
alaska is the northernmost and westernmost state in the united states and has the most easterly longitude in the united states because the aleutian islands extend into the eastern hemisphere . alaska is the only non-contiguous u.s. state on continental north america ; about 500 miles ( 800 km ) of british columbia ( canada ) separates alaska from washington . it is technically part of the continental u.s. , but is sometimes not included in colloquial use ; alaska is not part of the contiguous u.s. , often called " the lower 48 . " the capital city , juneau , is situated on the mainland of the north american continent but is not connected by road to the rest of the north american highway system .
but house was also being developed on ibiza , [ citation needed ] although no house artists or labels were coming from this tiny island at the time . by the mid-1980s a distinct balearic mix of house was discernible . [ citation needed ] several clubs such as amnesia with dj alfredo were playing a mix of rock , pop , disco and house . these clubs , fueled by their distinctive sound and ecstasy , began to have an influence on the british scene . by late 1987 , djs such as trevor fung , paul oakenfold and danny rampling were bringing the ibiza sound to uk clubs such as the hacienda in manchester , and in london clubs such as shoom in southwark , heaven , future and spectrum .
during the initial punk era , a variety of entrepreneurs interested in local punk-influenced music scenes began founding independent record labels , including rough trade ( founded by record shop owner geoff travis ) and factory ( founded by manchester-based television personality tony wilson ) . by 1977 , groups began pointedly pursuing methods of releasing music independently , an idea disseminated in particular by the buzzcocks ' release of their spiral scratch ep on their own label as well as the self-released 1977 singles of desperate bicycles . these diy imperatives would help form the production and distribution infrastructure of post-punk and the indie music scene that later blossomed in the mid-1980s .
a census of sea life carried out during the international polar year and which involved some 500 researchers was released in 2010 . the research is part of the global census of marine life ( coml ) and has disclosed some remarkable findings . more than 235 marine organisms live in both polar regions , having bridged the gap of 12,000 km ( 7,456 mi ) . large animals such as some cetaceans and birds make the round trip annually . more surprising are small forms of life such as mudworms , sea cucumbers and free-swimming snails found in both polar oceans . various factors may aid in their distribution - fairly uniform temperatures of the deep ocean at the poles and the equator which differ by no more than 5 ° c , and the major current systems or marine conveyor belt which transport eggs and larval stages .
some species of marine animals exist and rely , directly or indirectly , on the phytoplankton . antarctic sea life includes penguins , blue whales , orcas , colossal squids and fur seals . the emperor penguin is the only penguin that breeds during the winter in antarctica , while the adelie penguin breeds farther south than any other penguin . the rockhopper penguin has distinctive feathers around the eyes , giving the appearance of elaborate eyelashes . king penguins , chinstrap penguins , and gentoo penguins also breed in the antarctic .
in the race for individual contributions , economist lyndon larouche dominated the pack leading up to the primaries . according to the federal election commission statistics , larouche had more individual contributors to his 2004 presidential campaign than any other candidate , until the final quarter of the primary season , when john kerry surpassed him . as of the april 15 filing , larouche had 7834 individual contributions , of those who have given cumulatively , $ 200 or more , as compared to 6257 for john kerry , 5582 for john edwards , 4090 for howard dean , and 2744 for gephardt .
in 1976 , a group of italian american professors at city university of new york asked to be added as an affirmative action category for promotion and hiring . italian americans are usually considered white in the us and would not be covered under affirmative action policies , but the professors believed they were underrepresented . libertarian economist thomas sowell wrote in his book , affirmative action around the world : an empirical study , that affirmative action policies encourage non-preferred groups to designate themselves as members of preferred groups [ i.e. , primary beneficiaries of affirmative action ] to take advantage of group preference policies .
the abundant variety of natural life depicted in the butrint mosaics celebrates the richness of god 's creation ; some elements also have specific connotations . the kantharos vase and vine refer to the eucharist , the symbol of the sacrifice of christ leading to salvation . peacocks are symbols of paradise and resurrection ; shown eating or drinking from the vase they indicate the route to eternal life . deer or stags were commonly used as images of the faithful aspiring to christ : " as a heart desireth the water brook , so my souls longs for thee , o god . " water-birds and fish and other sea-creatures can indicate baptism as well as the members of the church who are christened .
pioneer electronics also entered the optical disc market in 1977 as a 50 / 50 joint-venture with mca called universal-pioneer and manufacturing mca designed industrial players under the mca discovision name ( the pr-7800 and pr-7820 ) . for the 1980 launch of the first universal-pioneer player , the vp-1000 was noted as a " laser disc player , " although the " laserdisc " logo displayed clearly on the device . in 1981 , " laserdisc " was used exclusively for the medium itself , although the official name was " laservision " ( as seen at the beginning of many laserdisc releases just before the start of the film ) . however , as pioneer reminded numerous video magazines and stores in 1984 , laserdisc was a trademarked word , standing only for laservision products manufactured for sale by pioneer video or pioneer electronics . a 1984 ray charles ad for the ld-700 player bore the term " pioneer laserdisc brand videodisc player . " from 1981 until the early 1990s , all properly licensed discs carried the laservision name and logo , even pioneer artists titles .
unfpa is the world 's largest multilateral source of funding for population and reproductive health programs . the fund works with governments and non-governmental organizations in over 150 countries with the support of the international community , supporting programs that help women , men and young people :
greenhouses convert solar light to heat , enabling year-round production and the growth ( in enclosed environments ) of specialty crops and other plants not naturally suited to the local climate . primitive greenhouses were first used during roman times to produce cucumbers year-round for the roman emperor tiberius . the first modern greenhouses were built in europe in the 16th century to keep exotic plants brought back from explorations abroad . greenhouses remain an important part of horticulture today , and plastic transparent materials have also been used to similar effect in polytunnels and row covers .
the bbc domestic television channels do not broadcast advertisements ; they are instead funded by a television licence fee which tv viewers are required to pay annually . this includes viewers who watch real-time streams of the bbc 's channels online or via their mobile phone . the bbc 's international television channels are funded by advertisements and subscription .
in 1945 , plymouth-born michael foot was elected labour mp for the war-torn constituency of plymouth devonport and after serving as secretary of state for education and responsible for the 1974 health and safety at work act , went on to become one of the most distinguished leaders of the labour party .
constantine the great , who along with licinius had decreed toleration of christianity in the roman empire by what is commonly called the " edict of milan , " and was the first roman emperor baptized , set precedents for later policy . by roman law the emperor was pontifex maximus , the high priest of the college of pontiffs ( collegium pontificum ) of all recognized religions in ancient rome . to put an end to the doctrinal debate initiated by arius , constantine called the first of what would afterwards be called the ecumenical councils and then enforced orthodoxy by imperial authority .
rainfall along the coast averages about 10 inches ( 250 mm ) of precipitation annually . the average ( mean ) rainfall is 10.65 inches ( 271 mm ) and the median is 9.6 inches ( 240 mm ) . most of the rainfall occurs during the cooler months . the months of december through march supply most of the rain , with february the only month averaging 2 inches ( 51 mm ) or more of rain . the months of may through september tend to be almost completely dry . though there are few wet days per month during the rainy period , rainfall can be heavy when it does fall . rainfall is usually greater in the higher elevations of san diego ; some of the higher elevation areas of san diego can receive 11-15 inches ( 280-380 mm ) of rain a year . variability of rainfall can be extreme : in the wettest years of 1883 / 1884 and 1940 / 1941 more than 24 inches ( 610 mm ) fell in the city , whilst in the driest years as little as 3.2 inches ( 80 mm ) has fallen for a full year . the wettest month on record has been december 1921 with 9.21 inches ( 234 mm ) .
new haven lies in the transition between a humid continental climate ( koppen climate classification : dfa ) and humid subtropical climate ( koppen cfa ) , but having more characteristics of the former , as is typical of much of the new york metropolitan area . summers are humid and warm , with temperatures exceeding 90 ° f ( 32 ° c ) on 7-8 days per year . winters are cold with moderate snowfall interspersed with rainfall and occasionally mixed precipitation . the weather patterns that affect new haven result from a primarily offshore direction , thus reducing the marine influence of long island sound - although , like other marine areas , differences in temperature between areas right along the coastline and areas a mile or two inland can be large at times .
montana 's motto , oro y plata , spanish for " gold and silver , " recognizing the significant role of mining , was first adopted in 1865 , when montana was still a territory . a state seal with a miner 's pick and shovel above the motto , surrounded by the mountains and the great falls of the missouri river , was adopted during the first meeting of the territorial legislature in 1864-65 . the design was only slightly modified after montana became a state and adopted it as the great seal of the state of montana , enacted by the legislature in 1893 . the state flower , the bitterroot , was adopted in 1895 with the support of a group called the floral emblem association , which formed after montana 's women 's christian temperance union adopted the bitterroot as the organization 's state flower . all other symbols were adopted throughout the 20th century , save for montana 's newest symbol , the state butterfly , the mourning cloak , adopted in 2001 , and the state lullaby , " montana lullaby , " adopted in 2007 .
in may 1778 , burke supported a parliamentary motion revising restrictions on irish trade . his constituents , citizens of the great trading city of bristol , however urged burke to oppose free trade with ireland . burke resisted their protestations and said : " if , from this conduct , i shall forfeit their suffrages at an ensuing election , it will stand on record an example to future representatives of the commons of england , that one man at least had dared to resist the desires of his constituents when his judgment assured him they were wrong . "
in the city , 24.6 % of the population were under the age of 18 , 10.2 % from 18 to 24 , 26.8 % from 25 to 44 , 25.8 % from 45 to 64 , and 12.7 % who were 65 years of age or older . the median age was 36.3 years . for every 100 females there were 96.2 males . for every 100 females age 18 and over , there were 94.4 males .
the assumption that black-body radiation is thermal leads to an accurate prediction : the total amount of emitted energy goes up with the temperature according to a definite rule , the stefan-boltzmann law ( 1879-84 ) . but it was also known that the colour of the light given off by a hot object changes with the temperature , so that " white hot " is hotter than " red hot . " nevertheless , wilhelm wien discovered the mathematical relationship between the peaks of the curves at different temperatures , by using the principle of adiabatic invariance . at each different temperature , the curve is moved over by wien 's displacement law ( 1893 ) . wien also proposed an approximation for the spectrum of the object , which was correct at high frequencies ( short wavelength ) but not at low frequencies ( long wavelength ) . it still was not clear why the spectrum of a hot object had the form that it has ( see diagram ) .
gautama was now determined to complete his spiritual quest . at the age of 35 , he famously sat in meditation under a ficus religiosa tree now called the bodhi tree in the town of bodh gaya and vowed not to rise before achieving enlightenment . after many days , he finally destroyed the fetters of his mind , thereby liberating himself from the cycle of suffering and rebirth , and arose as a fully enlightened being ( skt. samyaksambuddha ) . soon thereafter , he attracted a band of followers and instituted a monastic order . now , as the buddha , he spent the rest of his life teaching the path of awakening he had discovered , traveling throughout the northeastern part of the indian subcontinent , and died at the age of 80 ( 483 bce ) in kushinagar , india . the south branch of the original fig tree available only in anuradhapura sri lanka is known as jaya sri maha bodhi .
genes with a most recent common ancestor , and thus a shared evolutionary ancestry , are known as homologs . these genes appear either from gene duplication within an organism 's genome , where they are known as paralogous genes , or are the result of divergence of the genes after a speciation event , where they are known as orthologous genes , : 7.6 and often perform the same or similar functions in related organisms . it is often assumed that the functions of orthologous genes are more similar than those of paralogous genes , although the difference is minimal .
the british library notes that " chopin 's works have been recorded by all the great pianists of the recording era . " the earliest recording was an 1895 performance by paul pabst of the nocturne in e major op. 62 no. 2 . the british library site makes available a number of historic recordings , including some by alfred cortot , ignaz friedman , vladimir horowitz , benno moiseiwitsch , paderewski , arthur rubinstein , xaver scharwenka and many others . a select discography of recordings of chopin works by pianists representing the various pedagogic traditions stemming from chopin is given by methuen-campbell in his work tracing the lineage and character of those traditions .
miami is a major center , and a leader in finance , commerce , culture , media , entertainment , the arts , and international trade . in 2012 , miami was classified as an alpha − world city in the world cities study group 's inventory . in 2010 , miami ranked seventh in the united states in terms of finance , commerce , culture , entertainment , fashion , education , and other sectors . it ranked 33rd among global cities . in 2008 , forbes magazine ranked miami " america 's cleanest city , " for its year-round good air quality , vast green spaces , clean drinking water , clean streets , and city-wide recycling programs . according to a 2009 ubs study of 73 world cities , miami was ranked as the richest city in the united states , and the world 's fifth-richest city in terms of purchasing power . miami is nicknamed the " capital of latin america , " is the second largest u.s. city with a spanish-speaking majority , and the largest city with a cuban-american plurality .
by the late 1950s , the motion picture business was again changing . the combination of the studio / theater-chain break-up and the rise of television saw the reduced audience size for cinema productions . the music corporation of america ( mca ) , then predominately a talent agency , had also become a powerful television producer , renting space at republic studios for its revue productions subsidiary . after a period of complete shutdown , a moribund universal agreed to sell its 360-acre ( 1.5 km ² ) studio lot to mca in 1958 , for $ 11 million , renamed revue studios . mca owned the studio lot , but not universal pictures , yet was increasingly influential on universal 's product . the studio lot was upgraded and modernized , while mca clients like doris day , lana turner , cary grant , and director alfred hitchcock were signed to universal pictures contracts .
two polish friends in paris were also to play important roles in chopin 's life there . his fellow student at the warsaw conservatory , julian fontana , had originally tried unsuccessfully to establish himself in england ; albert grzymała , who in paris became a wealthy financier and society figure , often acted as chopin 's adviser and " gradually began to fill the role of elder brother in [ his ] life . " fontana was to become , in the words of michałowski and samson , chopin 's " general factotum and copyist . "
albon man , a new york lawyer , started electro-dynamic light company in 1878 to exploit his patents and those of william sawyer . weeks later the united states electric lighting company was organized . this company didn 't made their first commercial installation of incandescent lamps until the fall of 1880 at the mercantile safe deposit company in new york city , about six months after the edison incandescent lamps had been installed on the columbia . hiram s. maxim was the chief engineer at the united states electric lighting company .
it should be noted that many samurai forces that were active throughout this period were not deployed to korea ; most importantly , the daimyo tokugawa ieyasu carefully kept forces under his command out of the korean campaigns , and other samurai commanders who were opposed to hideyoshi 's domination of japan either mulled hideyoshi 's call to invade korea or contributed a small token force . most commanders who did opposed or otherwise resisted / resented hideyoshi ended up as part of the so-called eastern army , while commanders loyal to hideyoshi and his son ( a notable exception to this trend was kato kiyomasa , who deployed with tokugawa and the eastern army ) were largely committed to the western army ; the two opposing sides ( so named for the relative geographical locations of their respective commanders ' domains ) would later clash , most notably at the battle of sekigahara , which was won by tokugawa ieyasu and the eastern forces , paving the way for the establishment of the tokugawa shogunate .
guinea-bissau is divided into eight regions ( regioes ) and one autonomous sector ( sector autonomo ) . these , in turn , are subdivided into 37 sectors . the regions are :
by knowing the underlying concepts of how the software works , the tester makes better-informed testing choices while testing the software from outside . typically , a grey-box tester will be permitted to set up an isolated testing environment with activities such as seeding a database . the tester can observe the state of the product being tested after performing certain actions such as executing sql statements against the database and then executing queries to ensure that the expected changes have been reflected . grey-box testing implements intelligent test scenarios , based on limited information . this will particularly apply to data type handling , exception handling , and so on .
from around 750 , during the abbasid caliphate , women " became renowned for their brains as well as their beauty . " in particular , many well known women of the time were trained from childhood in music , dancing and poetry . mahbuba was one of these . another feminine figure to be remembered for her achievements was tawaddud , " a slave girl who was said to have been bought at great cost by harun al-rashid because she had passed her examinations by the most eminent scholars in astronomy , medicine , law , philosophy , music , history , arabic grammar , literature , theology and chess . " moreover , among the most prominent feminine figures was shuhda who was known as " the scholar " or " the pride of women " during the 12th century in baghdad . despite the recognition of women 's aptitudes during the abbasid dynasty , all these came to an end in iraq with the sack of baghdad in 1258 .
in 1636 george , duke of brunswick-luneburg , ruler of the brunswick-luneburg principality of calenberg , moved his residence to hanover . the dukes of brunswick-luneburg were elevated by the holy roman emperor to the rank of prince-elector in 1692 , and this elevation was confirmed by the imperial diet in 1708 . thus the principality was upgraded to the electorate of brunswick-luneburg , colloquially known as the electorate of hanover after calenberg 's capital ( see also : house of hanover ) . its electors would later become monarchs of great britain ( and from 1801 , of the united kingdom of great britain and ireland ) . the first of these was george i louis , who acceded to the british throne in 1714 . the last british monarch who ruled in hanover was william iv . semi-salic law , which required succession by the male line if possible , forbade the accession of queen victoria in hanover . as a male-line descendant of george i , queen victoria was herself a member of the house of hanover . her descendants , however , bore her husband 's titular name of saxe-coburg-gotha . three kings of great britain , or the united kingdom , were concurrently also electoral princes of hanover .
as the economic situation worsened macdonald agreed to form a " national government " with the conservatives and the liberals . on 24 august 1931 macdonald submitted the resignation of his ministers and led a small number of his senior colleagues in forming the national government together with the other parties . this caused great anger among those within the labour party who felt betrayed by macdonald 's actions : he and his supporters were promptly expelled from the labour party and formed a separate national labour organisation . the remaining labour party mps ( led again by arthur henderson ) and a few liberals went into opposition . the ensuing 1931 general election resulted in overwhelming victory for the national government and disaster for the labour party which won only 52 seats , 225 fewer than in 1929 .
david archuleta 's performance of john lennon 's " imagine " was considered by many as one of the best of the season . jennifer lopez , who was brought in as a judge in season ten , called it a beautiful song-moment that she will never forget . jason castro 's semi-final performance of " hallelujah " also received considerable attention , and it propelled jeff buckley 's version of the song to the top of the billboard digital song chart . this was the first season in which contestants ' recordings were released onto itunes after their performances , and although sales information was not released so as not to prejudice the contest , leaked information indicated that contestants ' songs frequently reached the top of itunes sales charts .
during the wisconsinan glaciation , the new york city region was situated at the edge of a large ice sheet over 1,000 feet in depth . the ice sheet scraped away large amounts of soil , leaving the bedrock that serves as the geologic foundation for much of new york city today . later on , the ice sheet would help split apart what are now long island and staten island .
french members of parliament and other french politicians also organised a protest . all political parties in parliament - ump , socialists , new centre , communists , democratic movement ( centre ) and greens - jointly requested a pause in the national assembly 's session , which was granted , so that mps could step outside and unfurl a banner which read " respect for human rights in china . " the coach containing the torch drove past the national assembly and the assembled protesting mps , who shouted " freedom for tibet ! " several times as it passed .
pesticides may cause acute and delayed health effects in people who are exposed . pesticide exposure can cause a variety of adverse health effects , ranging from simple irritation of the skin and eyes to more severe effects such as affecting the nervous system , mimicking hormones causing reproductive problems , and also causing cancer . a 2007 systematic review found that " most studies on non-hodgkin lymphoma and leukemia showed positive associations with pesticide exposure " and thus concluded that cosmetic use of pesticides should be decreased . there is substantial evidence of associations between organophosphate insecticide exposures and neurobehavioral alterations . limited evidence also exists for other negative outcomes from pesticide exposure including neurological , birth defects , fetal death ,
in 1888 , the italian administration launched its first development projects in the new colony . the eritrean railway was completed to saati in 1888 , and reached asmara in the highlands in 1911 . the asmara-massawa cableway was the longest line in the world during its time , but was later dismantled by the british in world war ii . besides major infrastructural projects , the colonial authorities invested significantly in the agricultural sector . it also oversaw the provision of urban amenities in asmara and massawa , and employed many eritreans in public service , particularly in the police and public works departments . thousands of eritreans were concurrently enlisted in the army , serving during the italo-turkish war in libya as well as the first and second italo-abyssinian wars .
microbiological culture is a principal tool used to diagnose infectious disease . in a microbial culture , a growth medium is provided for a specific agent . a sample taken from potentially diseased tissue or fluid is then tested for the presence of an infectious agent able to grow within that medium . most pathogenic bacteria are easily grown on nutrient agar , a form of solid medium that supplies carbohydrates and proteins necessary for growth of a bacterium , along with copious amounts of water . a single bacterium will grow into a visible mound on the surface of the plate called a colony , which may be separated from other colonies or melded together into a " lawn . " the size , color , shape and form of a colony is characteristic of the bacterial species , its specific genetic makeup ( its strain ) , and the environment that supports its growth . other ingredients are often added to the plate to aid in identification . plates may contain substances that permit the growth of some bacteria and not others , or that change color in response to certain bacteria and not others . bacteriological plates such as these are commonly used in the clinical identification of infectious bacterium . microbial culture may also be used in the identification of viruses : the medium in this case being cells grown in culture that the virus can infect , and then alter or kill . in the case of viral identification , a region of dead cells results from viral growth , and is called a " plaque . " eukaryotic parasites may also be grown in culture as a means of identifying a particular agent .
a cabinet of coins is the munzkabinett der tui-ag . the polizeigeschichtliche sammlung niedersachsen is the largest police museum in germany . textiles from all over the world can be visited in the museum for textile art . the exposeeum is the museum of the world-exhibition " expo 2000 hannover . " carpets and objects from the orient can be visited in the oriental carpet museum . the blind man museum is a rarity in germany , another one is only in berlin . the museum of veterinary medicine is unique in germany . the museum for energy history describes the 150 years old history of the application of energy . the home museum ahlem shows the history of the district of ahlem . the mahn- und gedenkstatte ahlem describes the history of the jewish people in hanover and the stiftung ahlers pro arte / kestner pro arte shows modern art . modern art is also the main topic of the kunsthalle faust , the nord / lb art gellery and of the foro artistico / eisfabrik .
few species of reptiles or amphibians are found in great britain or ireland . only three snakes are native to great britain : the common european adder , the grass snake and the smooth snake ; none are native to ireland . in general , great britain has slightly more variation and native wild life , with weasels , polecats , wildcats , most shrews , moles , water voles , roe deer and common toads also being absent from ireland . this pattern is also true for birds and insects . notable exceptions include the kerry slug and certain species of wood lice native to ireland but not great britain .
sometimes circumstances such as a good breeding season followed by a food source failure the following year lead to irruptions in which large numbers of a species move far beyond the normal range . bohemian waxwings bombycilla garrulus well show this unpredictable variation in annual numbers , with five major arrivals in britain during the nineteenth century , but 18 between the years 1937 and 2000 . red crossbills loxia curvirostra too are irruptive , with widespread invasions across england noted in 1251 , 1593 , 1757 , and 1791 .
the cbc 's flagship newscast , the national , airs sunday through fridays at 10 : 00 p.m. est and saturdays at 6 : 00 p.m. est . until october 2006 , cbc owned-and-operated stations aired a second broadcast of the program at 11 : 00 p.m. ; this later broadcast included only the main news portion of the program , and excluded the analysis and documentary segment . this second airing was later replaced with other programming , and as of the 2012-13 television season , was replaced on cbc 's major market stations by a half-hour late newscast . there is also a short news update , at most , on late saturday evenings . during hockey season , this update is usually found during the first intermission of the second game of the doubleheader on hockey night in canada .

the current mac product family uses intel x86-64 processors . apple introduced an emulator during the transition from powerpc chips ( called rosetta ) , much as it did during the transition from motorola 68000 architecture a decade earlier . the macintosh is the only mainstream computer platform to have successfully transitioned to a new cpu architecture , and has done so twice . all current mac models ship with at least 8 gb of ram as standard other than the 1.4 ghz mac mini , macbook pro ( without retina display ) , and macbook air . current mac computers use ati radeon or nvidia geforce graphics cards as well as intel graphics built into the main cpu . all current macs ( except for the macbook pro without retina display ) do not ship with an optical media drive that includes a dual-function dvd / cd burner . apple refers to this as a superdrive . current macs include two standard data transfer ports : usb and thunderbolt ( except for the macbook ( 2015 version ) , which only has a usb-c port and headphone port ) . macbook pro , imac , macbook air , and mac mini computers now also feature the " thunderbolt " port , which apple says can transfer data at speeds up to 10 gigabits per second . usb was introduced in the 1998 imac g3 and is ubiquitous today , while firewire is mainly reserved for high-performance devices such as hard drives or video cameras . starting with the then-new imac g5 , released in october 2005 , apple started to include built-in isight cameras on appropriate models , and a media center interface called front row that can be operated by an apple remote or keyboard for accessing media stored on the computer . front row has been discontinued as of 2011 , however , and the apple remote is no longer bundled with new macs .
the german renaissance has bequeathed the city some noteworthy buildings ( especially the current chambre de commerce et d 'industrie , former town hall , on place gutenberg ) , as did the french baroque and classicism with several hotels particuliers ( i.e. palaces ) , among which the palais rohan ( 1742 , now housing three museums ) is the most spectacular . other buildings of its kind are the " hotel de hanau " ( 1736 , now the city hall ) , the hotel de klinglin ( 1736 , now residence of the prefet ) , the hotel des deux-ponts ( 1755 , now residence of the military governor ) , the hotel d 'andlau-klinglin ( 1725 , now seat of the administration of the port autonome de strasbourg ) etc . the largest baroque building of strasbourg though is the 150 m ( 490 ft ) long 1720s main building of the hopital civil . as for french neo-classicism , it is the opera house on place broglie that most prestigiously represents this style .
in several nations , rulers welcomed leaders of the enlightenment at court and asked them to help design laws and programs to reform the system , typically to build stronger national states . these rulers are called " enlightened despots " by historians . they included frederick the great of prussia , catherine the great of russia , leopold ii of tuscany , and joseph ii of austria . joseph was over-enthusiastic , announcing so many reforms that had so little support that revolts broke out and his regime became a comedy of errors and nearly all his programs were reversed . senior ministers pombal in portugal and struensee in denmark also governed according to enlightenment ideals . in poland , the model constitution of 1791 expressed enlightenment ideals , but was in effect for only one year as the nation was partitioned among its neighbors . more enduring were the cultural achievements , which created a nationalist spirit in poland .
burgh ( 2006 ) , suggests that the roots of western classical music ultimately lie in ancient egyptian art music via cheironomy and the ancient egyptian orchestra , which dates to 2695 bc . this was followed by early christian liturgical music , which itself dates back to the ancient greeks [ citation needed ] . the development of individual tones and scales was made by ancient greeks such as aristoxenus and pythagoras . pythagoras created a tuning system and helped to codify musical notation . ancient greek instruments such as the aulos ( a reed instrument ) and the lyre ( a stringed instrument similar to a small harp ) eventually led to the modern-day instruments of a classical orchestra . the antecedent to the early period was the era of ancient music before the fall of the roman empire ( 476 ad ) . very little music survives from this time , most of it from ancient greece .

scarab beetles held religious and cultural symbolism in old egypt , greece and some shamanistic old world cultures . the ancient chinese regarded cicadas as symbols of rebirth or immortality . in mesopotamian literature , the epic poem of gilgamesh has allusions to odonata which signify the impossibility of immortality . amongst the aborigines of australia of the arrernte language groups , honey ants and witchety grubs served as personal clan totems . in the case of the ' san ' bush-men of the kalahari , it is the praying mantis which holds much cultural significance including creation and zen-like patience in waiting . : 9
dell traces its origins to 1984 , when michael dell created dell computer corporation , which at the time did business as pc 's limited , while a student of the university of texas at austin . the dorm-room headquartered company sold ibm pc-compatible computers built from stock components . dell dropped out of school to focus full-time on his fledgling business , after getting $ 1,000 in expansion-capital from his family . in 1985 , the company produced the first computer of its own design , the turbo pc , which sold for $ 795 . pc 's limited advertised its systems in national computer magazines for sale directly to consumers and custom assembled each ordered unit according to a selection of options . the company grossed more than $ 73 million in its first year of operation .
tower control controls aircraft on the runway and in the controlled airspace immediately surrounding the airport . tower controllers may use radar to locate an aircraft 's position in three-dimensional space , or they may rely on pilot position reports and visual observation . they coordinate the sequencing of aircraft in the traffic pattern and direct aircraft on how to safely join and leave the circuit . aircraft which are only passing through the airspace must also contact tower control in order to be sure that they remain clear of other traffic .
precipitation is rather uniformly distributed throughout the year . however , dry periods lasting several weeks do occur , especially in autumn when long periods of pleasant , mild weather are most common . there is considerable variability in total monthly amounts from year to year so that no one month can be depended upon to be normal . snow has been recorded during seven of the twelve months . falls of 3 inches ( 7.6 cm ) or more within 24 hours occur an average once per year . annual snowfall , however , is usually light , averaging 10.5 inches ( 27 cm ) per season . snow typically remains on the ground only one or two days at a time , but remained for 16 days in 2010 ( january 30 to february 14 ) . ice storms ( freezing rain or glaze ) are not uncommon , but they are seldom severe enough to do any considerable damage .
between the 5th and 8th centuries , new peoples and individuals filled the political void left by roman centralised government . the ostrogoths settled in italy in the late 5th century under theoderic ( d . 526 ) and set up a kingdom marked by its co-operation between the italians and the ostrogoths , at least until the last years of theodoric 's reign . the burgundians settled in gaul , and after an earlier realm was destroyed by the huns in 436 formed a new kingdom in the 440s . between today 's geneva and lyon , it grew to become the realm of burgundy in the late 5th and early 6th centuries . in northern gaul , the franks and britons set up small polities . the frankish kingdom was centred in north-eastern gaul , and the first king of whom much is known is childeric ( d . 481 ) . [ g ] under childeric 's son clovis ( r . 509-511 ) , the frankish kingdom expanded and converted to christianity . britons , related to the natives of britannia - modern-day great britain - settled in what is now brittany . [ h ] other monarchies were established by the visigoths in iberia , the suevi in north-western iberia , and the vandals in north africa . in the 6th century , the lombards settled in northern italy , replacing the ostrogothic kingdom with a grouping of duchies that occasionally selected a king to rule over them all . by the late 6th century this arrangement had been replaced by a permanent monarchy .
separation of powers is a political doctrine originating in the writings of montesquieu in the spirit of the laws where he urged for a constitutional government with three separate branches of government . each of the three branches would have defined abilities to check the powers of the other branches . this idea was called separation of powers . this philosophy heavily influenced the writing of the united states constitution , according to which the legislative , executive , and judicial branches of the united states government are kept distinct in order to prevent abuse of power . this united states form of separation of powers is associated with a system of checks and balances .

another civil war ensued after the death of karim khan in 1779 , out of which aqa mohammad khan emerged , founding the qajar dynasty in 1794 . in 1795 , following the disobedience of the georgian subjects and their alliance with the russians , the qajars captured tblisi by the battle of krtsanisi , and drove the russians out of the entire caucasus , reestablishing a short-lived iranian suzerainty over the region . the russo-persian wars of 1804-1813 and 1826-1828 resulted in large irrevocable territorial losses for iran in the caucasus , comprising all of transcaucasia and dagestan , which made part of the very concept of iran for centuries , and thus substantial gains for the neighboring russian empire .
the possibility of unlikely victories in the earlier rounds of the competition , where lower ranked teams beat higher placed opposition , known as " giant killings , " is much anticipated by the public , and is considered an integral part of the tradition and prestige of the competition , alongside that gained by teams winning the competition . almost every club in the league pyramid has a fondly remembered giant-killing act in its history . it is considered particularly newsworthy when a top premier league team suffers an upset defeat , or where the giant-killer is a non-league club , i.e. from outside the professional levels of the football league .
wary of protests , the indian authorities have decided to shorten the route of the relay in new delhi , and have given it the security normally associated with republic day celebrations , which are considered terrorist targets . chinese intelligence 's expectations of points on the relay route that would be particularly ' vulnerable ' to protesters were presented to the indian ambassador to beijing , nirupama sen. the indian media responded angrily to the news that the ambassador , a distinguished lady diplomat , was summoned to the foreign ministry at 2 am local time ; the news was later denied by anonymous sources in delhi . the indian media reported that india 's commerce minister , kamal nath , cancelled an official trip to beijing in protest , though both nath and chinese sources have denied it .

unlike other new communist states in east-central europe , yugoslavia liberated itself from axis domination with limited direct support from the red army . tito 's leading role in liberating yugoslavia not only greatly strengthened his position in his party and among the yugoslav people , but also caused him to be more insistent that yugoslavia had more room to follow its own interests than other bloc leaders who had more reasons ( and pressures ) to recognize soviet efforts in helping them liberate their own countries from axis control . although tito was formally an ally of stalin after world war ii , the soviets had set up a spy ring in the yugoslav party as early as 1945 , giving way to an uneasy alliance .

in 1994 , responding to the need for a more useful system for describing chronic pain , the international association for the study of pain ( iasp ) classified pain according to specific characteristics : ( 1 ) region of the body involved ( e.g. abdomen , lower limbs ) , ( 2 ) system whose dysfunction may be causing the pain ( e.g. , nervous , gastrointestinal ) , ( 3 ) duration and pattern of occurrence , ( 4 ) intensity and time since onset , and ( 5 ) etiology . however , this system has been criticized by clifford j. woolf and others as inadequate for guiding research and treatment . woolf suggests three classes of pain : ( 1 ) nociceptive pain , ( 2 ) inflammatory pain which is associated with tissue damage and the infiltration of immune cells , and ( 3 ) pathological pain which is a disease state caused by damage to the nervous system or by its abnormal function ( e.g. fibromyalgia , irritable bowel syndrome , tension type headache , etc . ) .

the third digimon series , which began airing on april 1 , 2001 , is set largely in a " real world " where the adventure and adventure 02 series are television shows , and where digimon game merchandise ( based on actual items ) become key to providing power boosts to real digimon which appear in that world . the plot revolves around three tamers , takato matsuki , rika nonaka , and henry wong . it began with takato creating his own digimon partner by sliding a mysterious blue card through his card reader , which then became a d-power . guilmon takes form from takato 's sketchings of a new digimon . ( tamers ' only human connection to the adventure series is ryo akiyama , a character featured in some of the digimon video games and who made an appearance in some occasions of the adventure story-line . ) some of the changes in this series include the way the digimon digivolve with the introduction of biomerge-digivolution and the way their " digivices " work . in this series , the tamers can slide game cards through their " digivices " and give their digimon partners certain advantages , as in the card game . this act is called " digi-modify " ( card slash in the japanese version ) . the same process was often used to digivolve the digimon , but as usual , emotions play a big part in the digivolving process . unlike the two seasons before it and most of the seasons that followed , digimon tamers takes a darker and more realistic approach to its story featuring digimon who do not reincarnate after their deaths and more complex character development in the original japanese . the anime has become controversial over the decade , with debates about how appropriate this show actually is for its " target " audience , especially due to the lovecraftian nature of the last arc . the english dub is more lighthearted dialogue-wise , though still not as much as previous series .

town terraced houses for all social classes remained resolutely tall and narrow , each dwelling occupying the whole height of the building . this contrasted with well-off continental dwellings , which had already begun to be formed of wide apartments occupying only one or two floors of a building ; such arrangements were only typical in england when housing groups of batchelors , as in oxbridge colleges , the lawyers in the inns of court or the albany after it was converted in 1802 . in the period in question , only in edinburgh were working-class purpose-built tenements common , though lodgers were common in other cities . a curving crescent , often looking out at gardens or a park , was popular for terraces where space allowed . in early and central schemes of development , plots were sold and built on individually , though there was often an attempt to enforce some uniformity , but as development reached further out schemes were increasingly built as a uniform scheme and then sold .
the first commercial leds were commonly used as replacements for incandescent and neon indicator lamps , and in seven-segment displays , first in expensive equipment such as laboratory and electronics test equipment , then later in such appliances as tvs , radios , telephones , calculators , as well as watches ( see list of signal uses ) . until 1968 , visible and infrared leds were extremely costly , in the order of us $ 200 per unit , and so had little practical use . the monsanto company was the first organization to mass-produce visible leds , using gallium arsenide phosphide ( gaasp ) in 1968 to produce red leds suitable for indicators . hewlett packard ( hp ) introduced leds in 1968 , initially using gaasp supplied by monsanto . these red leds were bright enough only for use as indicators , as the light output was not enough to illuminate an area . readouts in calculators were so small that plastic lenses were built over each digit to make them legible . later , other colors became widely available and appeared in appliances and equipment . in the 1970s commercially successful led devices at less than five cents each were produced by fairchild optoelectronics . these devices employed compound semiconductor chips fabricated with the planar process invented by dr. jean hoerni at fairchild semiconductor . the combination of planar processing for chip fabrication and innovative packaging methods enabled the team at fairchild led by optoelectronics pioneer thomas brandt to achieve the needed cost reductions . these methods continue to be used by led producers .
after 1800 , cotton and tobacco became important export crops . the eastern half of the state , especially the tidewater region , developed a slave society based on a plantation system and slave labor . many free people of color migrated to the frontier along with their european-american neighbors , where the social system was looser . by 1810 , nearly 3 percent of the free population consisted of free people of color , who numbered slightly more than 10,000 . the western areas were dominated by white families , especially scots-irish , who operated small subsistence farms . in the early national period , the state became a center of jeffersonian and jacksonian democracy , with a strong whig presence , especially in the west . after nat turner 's slave uprising in 1831 , north carolina and other southern states reduced the rights of free blacks . in 1835 the legislature withdrew their right to vote .
for multicellular organisms , typically the embryo is engineered which grows into the adult genetically modified organism . however , the genomes of cells in an adult organism can be edited using gene therapy techniques to treat genetic diseases .
by the early 18th century , the maratha kingdom had transformed itself into the maratha empire under the rule of the peshwas ( prime ministers ) . in 1737 , the marathas defeated a mughal army in their capital , delhi itself in battle of delhi ( 1737 ) . the marathas continued their military campaigns against mughals , nizam , nawab of bengal and durrani empire to further extend their boundaries . gordon explained how the maratha systematically took control over new regions . they would start with annual raids , followed by collecting ransom from villages and towns while the declining mughal empire retained nominal control and finally taking over the region . he explained it with the example of malwa region . marathas built an efficient system of public administration known for its attention to detail . it succeeded in raising revenue in districts that recovered from years of raids , up to levels previously enjoyed by the mughals . for example , the cornerstone of the maratha rule in malwa rested on the 60 or so local tax collectors who advanced the maratha ruler peshwa a portion of their district revenues at interest . by 1760 , the domain of the marathas stretched across practically the entire subcontinent . the north-western expansion of the marathas was stopped after the third battle of panipat ( 1761 ) . however , the maratha authority in the north was re-established within a decade under peshwa madhavrao i. the defeat of marathas by british in third anglo-maratha wars brought end to the empire by 1820 . the last peshwa , baji rao ii , was defeated by the british in the third anglo-maratha war . with the defeat of the marathas , no native power represented any significant threat for the british afterwards .
some consider koshari ( a mixture of rice , lentils , and macaroni ) to be the national dish . fried onions can be also added to koshari . in addition , ful medames ( mashed fava beans ) is one of the most popular dishes . fava bean is also used in making falafel ( also known as " ta 'meyya " ) , which may have originated in egypt and spread to other parts of the middle east . garlic fried with coriander is added to mulukhiyya , a popular green soup made from finely chopped jute leaves , sometimes with chicken or rabbit .
in the context of chemistry , energy is an attribute of a substance as a consequence of its atomic , molecular or aggregate structure . since a chemical transformation is accompanied by a change in one or more of these kinds of structure , it is invariably accompanied by an increase or decrease of energy of the substances involved . some energy is transferred between the surroundings and the reactants of the reaction in the form of heat or light ; thus the products of a reaction may have more or less energy than the reactants . a reaction is said to be exergonic if the final state is lower on the energy scale than the initial state ; in the case of endergonic reactions the situation is the reverse . chemical reactions are invariably not possible unless the reactants surmount an energy barrier known as the activation energy . the speed of a chemical reaction ( at given temperature t ) is related to the activation energy e , by the boltzmann 's population factor e − e / kt - that is the probability of molecule to have energy greater than or equal to e at the given temperature t. this exponential dependence of a reaction rate on temperature is known as the arrhenius equation.the activation energy necessary for a chemical reaction can be in the form of thermal energy .
paleobotanists study ancient plants in the fossil record to provide information about the evolutionary history of plants . cyanobacteria , the first oxygen-releasing photosynthetic organisms on earth , are thought to have given rise to the ancestor of plants by entering into an endosymbiotic relationship with an early eukaryote , ultimately becoming the chloroplasts in plant cells . the new photosynthetic plants ( along with their algal relatives ) accelerated the rise in atmospheric oxygen started by the cyanobacteria , changing the ancient oxygen-free , reducing , atmosphere to one in which free oxygen has been abundant for more than 2 billion years .
alaska has few road connections compared to the rest of the u.s. the state 's road system covers a relatively small area of the state , linking the central population centers and the alaska highway , the principal route out of the state through canada . the state capital , juneau , is not accessible by road , only a car ferry , which has spurred several debates over the decades about moving the capital to a city on the road system , or building a road connection from haines . the western part of alaska has no road system connecting the communities with the rest of alaska .
in contrast , the rok army defenders were relatively unprepared and ill-equipped . in south to the naktong , north to the yalu ( 1961 ) , r.e. appleman reports the rok forces ' low combat readiness as of 25 june 1950 . the rok army had 98,000 soldiers ( 65,000 combat , 33,000 support ) , no tanks ( they had been requested from the u.s. military , but requests were denied ) , and a 22-piece air force comprising 12 liaison-type and 10 at6 advanced-trainer airplanes . there were no large foreign military garrisons in korea at the time of the invasion , but there were large u.s. garrisons and air forces in japan .
during the oil boom of the 1970s , nigeria joined opec and the huge revenue generated made the economy richer . despite huge revenues from oil production and sale , the military administration did little to improve the standard of living of the population , help small and medium businesses , or invest in infrastructure . as oil revenues fuelled the rise of federal subventions to states , the federal government became the centre of political struggle and the threshold of power in the country . as oil production and revenue rose , the nigerian government became increasingly dependent on oil revenues and the international commodity markets for budgetary and economic concerns . it did not develop other sources of the economy for economic stability . that spelled doom to federalism in nigeria .
bush stated in an interview that the comment was " one of the most disgusting moments " of his presidency . in november 2010 , in a taped interview with matt lauer for the today show , west expressed regret for his criticism of bush . " i would tell george bush in my moment of frustration , i didn 't have the grounds to call him a racist , " he told lauer . " i believe that in a situation of high emotion like that we as human beings don 't always choose the right words . " the following day , bush reacted to the apology in a live interview with lauer saying he appreciated the rapper 's remorse . " i 'm not a hater , " bush said . " i don 't hate kanye west . i was talking about an environment in which people were willing to say things that hurt . nobody wants to be called a racist if in your heart you believe in equality of races . " reactions were mixed , but some felt that west had no need to apologize . " it was not the particulars of your words that mattered , it was the essence of a feeling of the insensitivity towards our communities that many of us have felt for far too long , " argued def jam co-founder russell simmons . bush himself was receptive to the apology , saying , " i appreciate that . it wasn 't just kanye west who was talking like that during katrina , i cited him as an example , i cited others as an example as well . you know , i appreciate that . "
a self-described " modern-day feminist , " beyonce creates songs that are often characterized by themes of love , relationships , and monogamy , as well as female sexuality and empowerment . on stage , her dynamic , highly choreographed performances have led to critics hailing her as one of the best entertainers in contemporary popular music . throughout a career spanning 19 years , she has sold over 118 million records as a solo artist , and a further 60 million with destiny 's child , making her one of the best-selling music artists of all time . she has won 20 grammy awards and is the most nominated woman in the award 's history . the recording industry association of america recognized her as the top certified artist in america during the 2000s decade . in 2009 , billboard named her the top radio songs artist of the decade , the top female artist of the 2000s and their artist of the millennium in 2011 . time listed her among the 100 most influential people in the world in 2013 and 2014 . forbes magazine also listed her as the most powerful female musician of 2015 .
the discovery of new maritime trade routes by western european states allowed them to avoid the ottoman trade monopoly . the portuguese discovery of the cape of good hope in 1488 initiated a series of ottoman-portuguese naval wars in the indian ocean throughout the 16th century . the somali muslim ajuran empire , allied with the ottomans , defied the portuguese economic monopoly in the indian ocean by employing a new coinage which followed the ottoman pattern , thus proclaiming an attitude of economic independence in regard to the portuguese .
liquor was another profitable private industry nationalized by the central government in 98 bc . however , this was repealed in 81 bc and a property tax rate of two coins for every 0.2 l ( 0.05 gallons ) was levied for those who traded it privately . by 110 bc emperor wu also interfered with the profitable trade in grain when he eliminated speculation by selling government-stored grain at a lower price than demanded by merchants . apart from emperor ming 's creation of a short-lived office for price adjustment and stabilization , which was abolished in 68 ad , central-government price control regulations were largely absent during the eastern han .
tucson 's sun tran bus system serves greater tucson with standard , express , regional shuttle , and on-demand shuttle bus service . it was awarded best transit system in 1988 and 2005 . a 3.9-mile streetcar line , sun link , connects the university of arizona campus with 4th avenue , downtown , and the mercado district west of interstate 10 and the santa cruz river . ten-minute headway passenger service began july 25 , 2014 . the streetcar utilizes sun tran 's card payment and transfer system , connecting with the university of arizona 's cattran shuttles , amtrak , and greyhound intercity bus service .
according to east asian and tibetan buddhism , there is an intermediate state ( tibetan " bardo " ) between one life and the next . the orthodox theravada position rejects this ; however there are passages in the samyutta nikaya of the pali canon that seem to lend support to the idea that the buddha taught of an intermediate stage between one life and the next .

in europe , the copyright infringement case public relations consultants association ltd v newspaper licensing agency ltd had two prongs ; one concerned whether a news aggregator service infringed the copyright of the news generators ; the other concerned whether the temporary web cache created by the web browser of a consumer of the aggregator 's service , also infringed the copyright of the news generators . the first prong was decided in favor of the news generators ; in june 2014 the second prong was decided by the court of justice of the european union ( cjeu ) , which ruled that the temporary web cache of consumers of the aggregator did not infringe the copyright of the news generators .
they are unaspirated for almost all speakers when immediately following word-initial s , as in spill , still , skill . after an s elsewhere in a word they are normally unaspirated as well , except sometimes in compound words . when the consonants in a cluster like st are analyzed as belonging to different morphemes ( heteromorphemic ) the stop is aspirated , but when they are analyzed as belonging to one morpheme the stop is unaspirated . [ citation needed ] for instance , distend has unaspirated [ t ] since it is not analyzed as two morphemes , but distaste has an aspirated middle [ tʰ ] because it is analyzed as dis- + taste and the word taste has an aspirated initial t .
chopin 's life and his relations with george sand have been fictionalized in numerous films . the 1945 biographical film a song to remember earned cornel wilde an academy award nomination as best actor for his portrayal of the composer . other film treatments have included : la valse de l 'adieu ( france , 1928 ) by henry roussel , with pierre blanchar as chopin ; impromptu ( 1991 ) , starring hugh grant as chopin ; la note bleue ( 1991 ) ; and chopin : desire for love ( 2002 ) .
the city 's planned design included specific areas for almost everything , including accommodation , hotels sectors north and south . new hotel facilities are being developed elsewhere , such as the hotels and tourism sector north , located on the shores of lake paranoa . brasilia has a range of tourist accommodation from inns , pensions and hostels to larger international chain hotels . the city 's restaurants cater to a wide range of foods from local and regional brazilian dishes to international cuisine .
photo cd is a system designed by kodak for digitizing and storing photos on a cd . launched in 1992 , the discs were designed to hold nearly 100 high-quality images , scanned prints and slides using special proprietary encoding . photo cds are defined in the beige book and conform to the cd-rom xa and cd-i bridge specifications as well . they are intended to play on cd-i players , photo cd players and any computer with the suitable software irrespective of the operating system . the images can also be printed out on photographic paper with a special kodak machine . this format is not to be confused with kodak picture cd , which is a consumer product in cd-rom format .
some europeans living among indigenous americans were called " white indians . " they " lived in native communities for years , learned native languages fluently , attended native councils , and often fought alongside their native companions . " more numerous and typical were traders and trappers , who married indigenous american women from tribes on the frontier and had families with them . some traders , who kept bases in the cities , had what ware called " country wives " among indigenous americans , with legal european-american wives and children at home in the city . not all abandoned their " natural " mixed-race children . some arranged for sons to be sent to european-american schools for their education .
the second half of the 20th century to the present has seen a gradual shift towards improved human rights for aboriginal people . in a 1967 referendum over 90 % of the australian population voted to end constitutional discrimination and to include aborigines in the national census . during this period many aboriginal activists began to embrace the term " black " and use their ancestry as a source of pride . activist bob maza said :
the cathedral has a heliometer ( solar " observatory " ) of 1690 , one of a number built in italy in the 17th and 18th centuries . the device itself is quite simple : a tiny hole in one of the minor domes acts as pinhole camera , projecting an image of the sun onto the floor at solar noon ( 12 : 00 in winter , 13 : 00 in summer ) . there is a bronze line , la meridiana on the floor , running precisely n / s. the ends of the line mark the positions as at the summer and winter solstices ; signs of the zodiac show the various other dates throughout the year .
candidates for freemasonry will have met most active members of the lodge they are joining before they are initiated . the process varies between jurisdictions , but the candidate will typically have been introduced by a friend at a lodge social function , or at some form of open evening in the lodge . in modern times , interested people often track down a local lodge through the internet . the onus is on candidates to ask to join ; while candidates may be encouraged to ask , they are never invited . once the initial inquiry is made , an interview usually follows to determine the candidate 's suitability . if the candidate decides to proceed from here , the lodge ballots on the application before he ( or she , depending on the masonic jurisdiction ) can be accepted .
imperial 's main campus is located in the south kensington area of central london . it is situated in an area of south kensington , known as albertopolis , which has a high concentration of cultural and academic institutions , adjacent to the natural history museum , the science museum , the victoria and albert museum , the royal college of music , the royal college of art , the royal geographical society and the royal albert hall . nearby public attractions include the kensington palace , hyde park and the kensington gardens , the national art library , and the brompton oratory . the expansion of the south kensington campus in the 1950s & 1960s absorbed the site of the former imperial institute , designed by thomas collcutt , of which only the 287 foot ( 87 m ) high queen 's tower remains among the more modern buildings .
gorbachev refused to make any changes to the status of nagorno karabakh , which remained part of azerbaijan . he instead sacked the communist party leaders in both republics - on may 21 , 1988 , kamran baghirov was replaced by abdulrahman vezirov as first secretary of the azerbaijan communist party . from july 23 to september 1988 , a group of azerbaijani intellectuals began working for a new organization called the popular front of azerbaijan , loosely based on the estonian popular front . on september 17 , when gun battles broke out between the armenians and azerbaijanis near stepanakert , two soldiers were killed and more than two dozen injured . this led to almost tit-for-tat ethnic polarization in nagorno-karabakh 's two main towns : the azerbaijani minority was expelled from stepanakert , and the armenian minority was expelled from shusha . on november 17 , 1988 , in response to the exodus of tens of thousands of azerbaijanis from armenia , a series of mass demonstrations began in baku 's lenin square , lasting 18 days and attracting half a million demonstrators . on december 5 , 1988 , the soviet militia finally moved in , cleared the square by force , and imposed a curfew that lasted ten months .
roman entanglement in the balkans began when illyrian piratical raids on roman merchants led to invasions of illyria ( the first and , second illyrian wars ) . tension between macedon and rome increased when the young king of macedon , philip v harbored one of the chief pirates , demetrius of pharos ( a former client of rome ) . as a result , in an attempt to reduce roman influence in the balkans , philip allied himself with carthage after hannibal had dealt the romans a massive defeat at the battle of cannae ( 216 bc ) during the second punic war . forcing the romans to fight on another front when they were at a nadir of manpower gained philip the lasting enmity of the romans ; the only real result from the somewhat insubstantial first macedonian war ( 215-202 bc ) .
another study examining the health and nutrition literacy status of residents of the lower mississippi delta found that 52 percent of participants had a high likelihood of limited literacy skills . while a precise comparison between the naal and delta studies is difficult , primarily because of methodological differences , zoellner et al. suggest that health literacy rates in the mississippi delta region are different from the u.s. general population and that they help establish the scope of the problem of health literacy among adults in the delta region . for example , only 12 percent of study participants identified the my pyramid graphic two years after it had been launched by the usda . the study also found significant relationships between nutrition literacy and income level and nutrition literacy and educational attainment further delineating priorities for the region .
the development of a three-field rotation system for planting crops [ aa ] increased the usage of land from one half in use each year under the old two-field system to two-thirds under the new system , with a consequent increase in production . the development of the heavy plough allowed heavier soils to be farmed more efficiently , aided by the spread of the horse collar , which led to the use of draught horses in place of oxen . horses are faster than oxen and require less pasture , factors that aided the implementation of the three-field system .
in his science of logic ( 1812-1814 ) hegel argues that finite qualities are not fully " real " because they depend on other finite qualities to determine them . qualitative infinity , on the other hand , would be more self-determining and hence more fully real . similarly finite natural things are less " real " - because they are less self-determining - than spiritual things like morally responsible people , ethical communities and god . so any doctrine , such as materialism , that asserts that finite qualities or natural objects are fully real is mistaken .
the industrial revolution in the midlands and northern england spelled the end for most of somerset 's cottage industries . farming continued to flourish , however , and the bath and west of england society for the encouragement of agriculture , arts , manufactures and commerce was founded in 1777 to improve farming methods . despite this , 20 years later john billingsley conducted a survey of the county 's agriculture in 1795 and found that agricultural methods could still be improved . coal mining was an important industry in north somerset during the 18th and 19th centuries , and by 1800 it was prominent in radstock . the somerset coalfield reached its peak production by the 1920s , but all the pits have now been closed , the last in 1973 . most of the surface buildings have been removed , and apart from a winding wheel outside radstock museum , little evidence of their former existence remains . further west , the brendon hills were mined for iron ore in the late 19th century ; this was taken by the west somerset mineral railway to watchet harbour for shipment to the furnaces at ebbw vale .
high speed internet connectivity has become more widely available at a reasonable cost and the cost of video capture and display technology has decreased . consequently , personal videoconferencing systems based on a webcam , personal computer system , software compression and broadband internet connectivity have become affordable to the general public . also , the hardware used for this technology has continued to improve in quality , and prices have dropped dramatically . the availability of freeware ( often as part of chat programs ) has made software based videoconferencing accessible to many .
hellenistic military equipment was generally characterized by an increase in size . hellenistic-era warships grew from the trireme to include more banks of oars and larger numbers of rowers and soldiers as in the quadrireme and quinquereme . the ptolemaic tessarakonteres was the largest ship constructed in antiquity . new siege engines were developed during this period . an unknown engineer developed the torsion-spring catapult ( ca . 360 ) and dionysios of alexandria designed a repeating ballista , the polybolos . preserved examples of ball projectiles range from 4.4 kg to 78 kg ( or over 170 lbs ) . demetrius poliorcetes was notorious for the large siege engines employed in his campaigns , especially during the 12-month siege of rhodes when he had epimachos of athens build a massive 160 ton siege tower named helepolis , filled with artillery .
by 1860 , houston had emerged as a commercial and railroad hub for the export of cotton . railroad spurs from the texas inland converged in houston , where they met rail lines to the ports of galveston and beaumont . during the american civil war , houston served as a headquarters for general john bankhead magruder , who used the city as an organization point for the battle of galveston . after the civil war , houston businessmen initiated efforts to widen the city 's extensive system of bayous so the city could accept more commerce between downtown and the nearby port of galveston . by 1890 , houston was the railroad center of texas .
miami is also considered a " hot spot " for dance music , freestyle , a style of dance music popular in the 80 's and 90 's heavily influenced by electro , hip-hop , and disco . many popular freestyle acts such as pretty tony , debbie deb , stevie b , and expose , originated in miami . indie / folk acts cat power and iron & wine are based in the city , while alternative hip hop artist sage francis , electro artist uffie , and the electroclash duo avenue d were born in miami , but musically based elsewhere . also , ska punk band against all authority is from miami , and rock / metal bands nonpoint and marilyn manson each formed in neighboring fort lauderdale . cuban american female recording artist , ana cristina , was born in miami in 1985 .
the sun remained loyal to thatcher right up to her resignation in november 1990 , despite the party 's fall in popularity over the previous year following the introduction of the poll tax ( officially known as the community charge ) . this change to the way local government is funded was vociferously supported by the newspaper , despite widespread opposition , ( some from conservative mps ) , which is seen as having contributed to thatcher 's own downfall . the tax was quickly repealed by her successor john major , whom the sun initially supported enthusiastically , believing he was a radical thatcherite - despite the economy having entered recession at this time .
in england , partly in response to a philosophy propounded by the oxford movement and others associated with the emerging revival of ' high church ' or anglo-catholic ideas during the second quarter of the 19th century , neo-gothic began to become promoted by influential establishment figures as the preferred style for ecclesiastical , civic and institutional architecture . the appeal of this gothic revival ( which after 1837 , in britain , is sometimes termed victorian gothic ) , gradually widened to encompass " low church " as well as " high church " clients . this period of more universal appeal , spanning 1855-1885 , is known in britain as high victorian gothic .
temporal measurement has occupied scientists and technologists , and was a prime motivation in navigation and astronomy . periodic events and periodic motion have long served as standards for units of time . examples include the apparent motion of the sun across the sky , the phases of the moon , the swing of a pendulum , and the beat of a heart . currently , the international unit of time , the second , is defined by measuring the electronic transition frequency of caesium atoms ( see below ) . time is also of significant social importance , having economic value ( " time is money " ) as well as personal value , due to an awareness of the limited time in each day and in human life spans .
a number of theories have been proposed regarding avicenna 's madhab ( school of thought within islamic jurisprudence ) . medieval historian zahir al-din al-bayhaqi ( d . 1169 ) considered avicenna to be a follower of the brethren of purity . on the other hand , dimitri gutas along with aisha khan and jules j. janssens demonstrated that avicenna was a sunni hanafi . however , the 14th cenutry shia faqih nurullah shushtari according to seyyed hossein nasr , maintained that he was most likely a twelver shia . conversely , sharaf khorasani , citing a rejection of an invitation of the sunni governor sultan mahmoud ghazanavi by avicenna to his court , believes that avicenna was an ismaili . similar disagreements exist on the background of avicenna 's family , whereas some writers considered them sunni , some more recent writers contested that they were shia .
1853 : there were four main events . 1 . in the north the turks captured the border fort of saint nicholas in a surprise night attack ( 27 / 28 october ) . they then pushed about 20000 troops across the cholok river border . being outnumbered the russians abandoned poti and redut kale and drew back to marani . both sides remained immobile for the next seven months . 2 . in the center the turks moved north from ardahan to within cannon-shot of akhaltsike and awaited reinforcements ( 13 november ) . the russians routed them . the claimed losses were 4000 turks and 400 russians . 3 . in the south about 30000 turks slowly moved east to the main russian concentration at gyumri or alexandropol ( november ) . they crossed the border and set up artillery south of town . prince orbeliani tried to drive them off and found himself trapped . the turks failed to press their advantage , the remaining russians rescued orbeliani and the turks retired west . orbeliani lost about 1000 men out of 5000 . the russians now decided to advance , the turks took up a strong position on the kars road and attacked . they were defeated in the battle of basgedikler , losing 6000 men , half their artillery and all their supply train . the russians lost 1300 , including prince orbeliani . this was prince ellico orbeliani whose wife was later kidnaped by shamyl at tsinandali . 4 . at sea the turks sent a fleet east which was destroyed by admiral nakhimov at sinope .
atari games created a line of nes products under the name tengen and took a different approach . the company attempted to reverse engineer the lockout chip to develop its own " rabbit " chip . however , tengen also obtained a description of the lockout chip from the united states patent and trademark office by falsely claiming that it was required to defend against present infringement claims in a legal case . nintendo sued tengen for copyright infringement , which tengen lost as it could not prove that the legally obtained patent documents had not been used by the reverse engineering team . tengen 's antitrust claims against nintendo were never finally decided .
clothing can and has in history been made from a very wide variety of materials . materials have ranged from leather and furs , to woven materials , to elaborate and exotic natural and synthetic fabrics . not all body coverings are regarded as clothing . articles carried rather than worn ( such as purses ) , worn on a single part of the body and easily removed ( scarves ) , worn purely for adornment ( jewelry ) , or those that serve a function other than protection ( eyeglasses ) , are normally considered accessories rather than clothing , as are footwear and hats .
the multi-national communist armed forces ' sole joint action was the warsaw pact invasion of czechoslovakia in august 1968 . all member countries , with the exception of the socialist republic of romania and the people 's republic of albania participated in the invasion .
a small , landlocked kingdom , swaziland is bordered in the north , west and south by the republic of south africa and by mozambique in the east . swaziland has a land area of 17,364 km2 . swaziland has four separate geographical regions . these run from north to south and are determined by altitude . swaziland is located at approximately 26 ° 30's , 31 ° 30'e . swaziland has a wide variety of landscapes , from the mountains along the mozambican border to savannas in the east and rain forest in the northwest . several rivers flow through the country , such as the great usutu river .
the distinctive characteristic of english cathedrals is their extreme length , and their internal emphasis upon the horizontal , which may be emphasised visually as much or more than the vertical lines . each english cathedral ( with the exception of salisbury ) has an extraordinary degree of stylistic diversity , when compared with most french , german and italian cathedrals . it is not unusual for every part of the building to have been built in a different century and in a different style , with no attempt at creating a stylistic unity . unlike french cathedrals , english cathedrals sprawl across their sites , with double transepts projecting strongly and lady chapels tacked on at a later date , such as at westminster abbey . in the west front , the doors are not as significant as in france , the usual congregational entrance being through a side porch . the west window is very large and never a rose , which are reserved for the transept gables . the west front may have two towers like a french cathedral , or none . there is nearly always a tower at the crossing and it may be very large and surmounted by a spire . the distinctive english east end is square , but it may take a completely different form . both internally and externally , the stonework is often richly decorated with carvings , particularly the capitals .
the standard connectors were designed to be robust . because usb is hot-pluggable , the connectors would be used more frequently , and perhaps with less care , than other connectors . many previous connector designs were fragile , specifying embedded component pins or other delicate parts that were vulnerable to bending or breaking . the electrical contacts in a usb connector are protected by an adjacent plastic tongue , and the entire connecting assembly is usually protected by an enclosing metal sheath .

officially , human sacrifice was obnoxious " to the laws of gods and men . " the practice was a mark of the " other , " attributed to rome 's traditional enemies such as the carthaginians and gauls . rome banned it on several occasions under extreme penalty . a law passed in 81 bc characterised human sacrifice as murder committed for magical purposes . pliny saw the ending of human sacrifice conducted by the druids as a positive consequence of the conquest of gaul and britain . despite an empire-wide ban under hadrian , human sacrifice may have continued covertly in north africa and elsewhere .
in all organisms , two steps are required to read the information encoded in a gene 's dna and produce the protein it specifies . first , the gene 's dna is transcribed to messenger rna ( mrna ) . : 6.1 second , that mrna is translated to protein . : 6.2 rna-coding genes must still go through the first step , but are not translated into protein . the process of producing a biologically functional molecule of either rna or protein is called gene expression , and the resulting molecule is called a gene product .
due to recording mastering and manufacturing limitations , both high and low frequencies were removed from the first recorded signals by various formulae . with low frequencies , the stylus must swing a long way from side to side , requiring the groove to be wide , taking up more space and limiting the playing time of the record . at high frequencies , hiss , pops , and ticks are significant . these problems can be reduced by using equalization to an agreed standard . during recording the amplitude of low frequencies is reduced , thus reducing the groove width required , and the amplitude at high frequencies is increased . the playback equipment boosts bass and cuts treble so as to restore the tonal balance in the original signal ; this also reduces the high frequency noise . thus more music will fit on the record , and noise is reduced .
in 2009 , hispanic and latino americans represented 52.0 % of the bronx 's population . puerto ricans represented 23.2 % of the borough 's population . over 72,500 mexicans lived in the bronx , and they formed 5.2 % of the population . cubans numbered over 9,640 members and formed 0.7 % of the population . in addition , over 319,000 people were of various hispanic and latino groups , such as dominican , salvadoran , and so on . these groups collectively represented 22.9 % of the population . at the 2010 census , 53.5 % of bronx 's population was of hispanic , latino , or spanish origin ( they may be of any race ) . asian americans are a small but sizable minority in the borough . roughly 49,600 asians make up 3.6 % of the population . roughly 13,600 indians call the bronx home , along with 9,800 chinese , 6,540 filipinos , 2,260 vietnamese , 2,010 koreans , and 1,100 japanese .
much of the current knowledge of memory has come from studying memory disorders , particularly amnesia . loss of memory is known as amnesia . amnesia can result from extensive damage to : ( a ) the regions of the medial temporal lobe , such as the hippocampus , dentate gyrus , subiculum , amygdala , the parahippocampal , entorhinal , and perirhinal cortices or the ( b ) midline diencephalic region , specifically the dorsomedial nucleus of the thalamus and the mammillary bodies of the hypothalamus . there are many sorts of amnesia , and by studying their different forms , it has become possible to observe apparent defects in individual sub-systems of the brain 's memory systems , and thus hypothesize their function in the normally working brain . other neurological disorders such as alzheimer 's disease and parkinson 's disease can also affect memory and cognition . hyperthymesia , or hyperthymesic syndrome , is a disorder that affects an individual 's autobiographical memory , essentially meaning that they cannot forget small details that otherwise would not be stored . korsakoff 's syndrome , also known as korsakoff 's psychosis , amnesic-confabulatory syndrome , is an organic brain disease that adversely affects memory by widespread loss or shrinkage of neurons within the prefrontal cortex .
by april 1945 , china had already been at war with japan for more than seven years . both nations were exhausted by years of battles , bombings and blockades . after japanese victories in operation ichi-go , japan were losing the battle in burma and facing constant attacks from chinese nationalists forces and communist guerrillas in the country side . the japanese army began preparations for the battle of west hunan in march 1945 . japanese mobilized 34th , 47th , 64th , 68th and 116th divisions , as well as the 86th independent brigade , for a total of 80,000 men to seize chinese airfields and secure railroads in west hunan by early april . in response , the chinese national military council dispatched the 4th front army and the 10th and 27th army groups with he yingqin as commander-in-chief . at the same time , it airlifted the entire chinese new 6th corps , an american-equipped corps and veterans of the burma expeditionary force , from kunming to zhijiang . chinese forces totaled 110,000 men in 20 divisions . they were supported by about 400 aircraft from chinese and american air forces . chinese forces achieved a decisive victory and launched a large counterattack in this campaign . concurrently , the chinese managed to repel a japanese offensive in henan and hubei . afterwards , chinese forces retook hunan and hubei provinces in south china . chinese launched a counter offensive to retake guangxi which was the last major japanese stronghold in south china . in august 1945 , chinese forces successfully retook guangxi .

emotions involve different components , such as subjective experience , cognitive processes , expressive behavior , psychophysiological changes , and instrumental behavior . at one time , academics attempted to identify the emotion with one of the components : william james with a subjective experience , behaviorists with instrumental behavior , psychophysiologists with physiological changes , and so on . more recently , emotion is said to consist of all the components . the different components of emotion are categorized somewhat differently depending on the academic discipline . in psychology and philosophy , emotion typically includes a subjective , conscious experience characterized primarily by psychophysiological expressions , biological reactions , and mental states . a similar multicomponential description of emotion is found in sociology . for example , peggy thoits described emotions as involving physiological components , cultural or emotional labels ( e.g. , anger , surprise etc . ) , expressive body actions , and the appraisal of situations and contexts .
wine was considered the basic drink , consumed at all meals and occasions by all classes and was quite inexpensive . cato the elder once advised cutting his rations in half to conserve wine for the workforce . many types of drinks involving grapes and honey were consumed as well . drinking on an empty stomach was regarded as boorish and a sure sign for alcoholism , the debilitating physical and psychological effects of which were known to the romans . an accurate accusation of being an alcoholic was an effective way to discredit political rivals . prominent roman alcoholics included mark antony , and cicero 's own son marcus ( cicero minor ) . even cato the younger was known to be a heavy drinker .

although several companies each produce over a billion individually packaged ( known as discrete ) transistors every year , the vast majority of transistors are now produced in integrated circuits ( often shortened to ic , microchips or simply chips ) , along with diodes , resistors , capacitors and other electronic components , to produce complete electronic circuits . a logic gate consists of up to about twenty transistors whereas an advanced microprocessor , as of 2009 , can use as many as 3 billion transistors ( mosfets ) . " about 60 million transistors were built in 2002 ... for [ each ] man , woman , and child on earth . "
the political structure of western europe changed with the end of the united roman empire . although the movements of peoples during this period are usually described as " invasions , " they were not just military expeditions but migrations of entire peoples into the empire . such movements were aided by the refusal of the western roman elites to support the army or pay the taxes that would have allowed the military to suppress the migration . the emperors of the 5th century were often controlled by military strongmen such as stilicho ( d . 408 ) , aspar ( d . 471 ) , ricimer ( d . 472 ) , or gundobad ( d . 516 ) , who were partly or fully of non-roman background . when the line of western emperors ceased , many of the kings who replaced them were from the same background . intermarriage between the new kings and the roman elites was common . this led to a fusion of roman culture with the customs of the invading tribes , including the popular assemblies that allowed free male tribal members more say in political matters than was common in the roman state . material artefacts left by the romans and the invaders are often similar , and tribal items were often modelled on roman objects . much of the scholarly and written culture of the new kingdoms was also based on roman intellectual traditions . an important difference was the gradual loss of tax revenue by the new polities . many of the new political entities no longer supported their armies through taxes , instead relying on granting them land or rents . this meant there was less need for large tax revenues and so the taxation systems decayed . warfare was common between and within the kingdoms . slavery declined as the supply weakened , and society became more rural .

according to cia world factbook , the people of republic of the congo are largely a mix of catholics ( 33.1 % ) , awakening lutherans ( 22.3 % ) and other protestants ( 19.9 % ) . followers of islam make up 1.6 % , and this is primarily due to an influx of foreign workers into the urban centers .
airports may also contain premium and vip services . the premium and vip services may include express check-in and dedicated check-in counters . these services are usually reserved for first and business class passengers , premium frequent flyers , and members of the airline 's clubs . premium services may sometimes be open to passengers who are members of a different airline 's frequent flyer program . this can sometimes be part of a reciprocal deal , as when multiple airlines are part of the same alliance , or as a ploy to attract premium customers away from rival airlines .
selenizza is a naturally occurring solid hydrocarbon bitumen found in the native asphalt deposit of selenice , in albania , the only european asphalt mine still in use . the rock asphalt is found in the form of veins , filling cracks in a more or less horizontal direction . the bitumen content varies from 83 % to 92 % ( soluble in carbon disulphide ) , with a penetration value near to zero and a softening point ( ring & ball ) around 120 ° c. the insoluble matter , consisting mainly of silica ore , ranges from 8 % to 17 % .
copper occurs naturally as native copper and was known to some of the oldest civilizations on record . it has a history of use that is at least 10,000 years old , and estimates of its discovery place it at 9000 bc in the middle east ; a copper pendant was found in northern iraq that dates to 8700 bc . there is evidence that gold and meteoric iron ( but not iron smelting ) were the only metals used by humans before copper . the history of copper metallurgy is thought to have followed the following sequence : 1 ) cold working of native copper , 2 ) annealing , 3 ) smelting , and 4 ) the lost wax method . in southeastern anatolia , all four of these metallurgical techniques appears more or less simultaneously at the beginning of the neolithic c . 7500 bc . however , just as agriculture was independently invented in several parts of the world , copper smelting was invented locally in several different places . it was probably discovered independently in china before 2800 bc , in central america perhaps around 600 ad , and in west africa about the 9th or 10th century ad . investment casting was invented in 4500-4000 bc in southeast asia and carbon dating has established mining at alderley edge in cheshire , uk at 2280 to 1890 bc . otzi the iceman , a male dated from 3300-3200 bc , was found with an axe with a copper head 99.7 % pure ; high levels of arsenic in his hair suggest his involvement in copper smelting . experience with copper has assisted the development of other metals ; in particular , copper smelting led to the discovery of iron smelting . production in the old copper complex in michigan and wisconsin is dated between 6000 and 3000 bc . natural bronze , a type of copper made from ores rich in silicon , arsenic , and ( rarely ) tin , came into general use in the balkans around 5500 bc .

the slave trade was engaged in by european state and non-state actors such as great britain , the netherlands , portugal and private companies , as well as various african states and non-state actors . with rising anti-slavery sentiment at home and changing economic realities , great britain outlawed the international slave trade in 1807 . following the napoleonic wars , great britain established the west africa squadron in an attempt to halt the international traffic in slaves . it stopped ships of other nations that were leaving the african coast with slaves ; the seized slaves were taken to freetown , a colony in west africa originally established for the resettlement of freed slaves from britain . britain intervened in the lagos kingship power struggle by bombarding lagos in 1851 , deposing the slave trade friendly oba kosoko , helping to install the amenable oba akitoye , and signing the treaty between great britain and lagos on 1 january 1852 . britain annexed lagos as a crown colony in august 1861 with the lagos treaty of cession . british missionaries expanded their operations and travelled further inland . in 1864 , samuel ajayi crowther became the first african bishop of the anglican church .
during the summer months , it is common for temperatures to reach over 90 ° f ( 32 ° c ) , with an average of 106.5 days per year , including a majority from june to september , with a high of 90 ° f or above and 4.6 days at or over 100 ° f ( 38 ° c ) . however , humidity usually yields a higher heat index . summer mornings average over 90 percent relative humidity . winds are often light in the summer and offer little relief , except in the far southeastern outskirts near the gulf coast and galveston . to cope with the strong humidity and heat , people use air conditioning in nearly every vehicle and building . in 1980 , houston was described as the " most air-conditioned place on earth . " officially , the hottest temperature ever recorded in houston is 109 ° f ( 43 ° c ) , which was reached both on september 4 , 2000 and august 28 , 2011 .
the first department store in the philippines is the hoskyn 's department store of hoskyn & co. established in 1877 in iloilo by the englishman henry hoskyn , nephew of nicholas loney , the first british vice-consul in iloilo . some of the earliest department stores in the philippines were located in manila as early as 1898 with the opening of the american bazaar , which was later named beck 's . during the course of the american occupation of the philippines , many department stores were built throughout the city , many of which were located in escolta . heacock 's , a luxury department store , was considered as the best department store in the orient . other department stores included aguinaldo 's , la puerta del sol , estrella del norte , and the crystal arcade , all of which were destroyed during the battle of manila in 1945 . after the war , department stores were once again alive with the establishment of shoemart ( now sm ) , and rustan 's . since the foundation of these companies in the 1950s , there are now more than one hundred department stores to date . at present , due to the huge success of shopping malls , department stores in the philippines usually are anchor tenants within malls . sm supermalls and robinsons malls are two of the country 's most prominent mall chains , all of which has department store sections .
this led popper to conclude that what were regarded [ by whom ? ] as the remarkable strengths of psychoanalytical theories were actually their weaknesses . psychoanalytical theories were crafted in a way that made them able to refute any criticism and to give an explanation for every possible form of human behaviour . the nature of such theories made it impossible for any criticism or experiment - even in principle - to show them to be false . this realisation had an important consequence when popper later tackled the problem of demarcation in the philosophy of science , as it led him to posit that the strength of a scientific theory lies in its both being susceptible to falsification , and not actually being falsified by criticism made of it . he considered that if a theory cannot , in principle , be falsified by criticism , it is not a scientific theory .

high school football teams frequently participate in controlled scrimmages with other teams during preseason practice , but exhibition games are rare because of league rules and concerns about finances , travel and player injuries , along with enrollments not being registered until the early part of august in most school districts under the traditional september-june academic term . a more common exhibition is the high school football all-star game , which brings together top players from a region . these games are typically played by graduating seniors during the summer or at the end of the season . many of these games , which include the u.s. army all-american bowl and under armour all-america game , are used as showcases for players to be seen by colleges .
in china , a call to boycott french hypermart carrefour from may 1 began spreading through mobile text messaging and online chat rooms amongst the chinese over the weekend from april 12 , accusing the company 's major shareholder , the lvmh group , of donating funds to the dalai lama . there were also calls to extend the boycott to include french luxury goods and cosmetic products . chinese protesters organized boycotts of the french-owned retail chain carrefour in major chinese cities including kunming , hefei and wuhan , accusing the french nation of pro-secessionist conspiracy and anti-chinese racism . some burned french flags , some added swastika ( due to its conotaions with nazism ) to the french flag , and spread short online messages calling for large protests in front of french consulates and embassy . some shoppers who insisted on entering one of the carrefour stores in kunming were blocked by boycotters wielding large chinese flags and hit by water bottles . hundreds of people joined anti-french rallies in beijing , wuhan , hefei , kunming and qingdao , which quickly spread to other cities like xi 'an , harbin and jinan . carrefour denied any support or involvement in the tibetan issue , and had its staff in its chinese stores wear uniforms emblazoned with the chinese national flag and caps with olympic insignia and as well as the words " beijing 2008 " to show its support for the games . the effort had to be ceased when the bocog deemed the use of official olympic insignia as illegal and a violation of copyright .
the baroque style had never truly been to the english taste . four influential books were published in the first quarter of the 18th century which highlighted the simplicity and purity of classical architecture : vitruvius britannicus ( colen campbell 1715 ) , palladio 's four books of architecture ( 1715 ) , de re aedificatoria ( 1726 ) and the designs of inigo jones ... with some additional designs ( 1727 ) . the most popular was the four-volume vitruvius britannicus by colen campbell . the book contained architectural prints of famous british buildings that had been inspired by the great architects from vitruvius to palladio . at first the book mainly featured the work of inigo jones , but the later tomes contained drawings and plans by campbell and other 18th-century architects . palladian architecture became well established in 18th-century britain .
sextus julius africanus further refers to the writings of historian thallus : " this darkness thallus , in the third book of his history , calls , as appears to me without reason , an eclipse of the sun . for the hebrews celebrate the passover on the 14th day according to the moon , and the passion of our saviour falls on the day before the passover ; but an eclipse of the sun takes place only when the moon comes under the sun . " christian apologist tertullian believed the event was documented in the roman archives .
digimon was first conceived as a virtual pet toy in the vein of tamagotchis and , as such , took influence from tamagotchis ' cute and round designs . the small areas of the screens ( 16 by 16 pixels ) meant that character designers had to create monsters whose forms would be easily recognizable . as such , many of the early digimon - including tyrannomon , the first one ever created - were based on dinosaurs . many further designs were created by kenji watanabe , who was brought in to help with the " x-antibody " creatures and art for the digimon collectible card game . watanabe was one influenced by american comics , which were beginning to gain popularity in japan , and as such began to make his characters look stronger and " cool . " the character creation process , however , has for most of the franchise 's history been collaborative and reliant on conversation and brainstorming .
in europe , it is the provision of accommodation , if anything , that now distinguishes inns from taverns , alehouses and pubs . the latter tend to provide alcohol ( and , in the uk , soft drinks and often food ) , but less commonly accommodation . inns tend to be older and grander establishments : historically they provided not only food and lodging , but also stabling and fodder for the traveller 's horse ( s ) and on some roads fresh horses for the mail coach . famous london inns include the george , southwark and the tabard . there is however no longer a formal distinction between an inn and other kinds of establishment . many pubs use " inn " in their name , either because they are long established former coaching inns , or to summon up a particular kind of image , or in many cases simply as a pun on the word " in , " as in " the welcome inn , " the name of many pubs in scotland .
the george washington bridge is the world 's busiest motor vehicle bridge , connecting manhattan to bergen county , new jersey . the verrazano-narrows bridge is the longest suspension bridge in the americas and one of the world 's longest . the brooklyn bridge is an icon of the city itself . the towers of the brooklyn bridge are built of limestone , granite , and rosendale cement , and their architectural style is neo-gothic , with characteristic pointed arches above the passageways through the stone towers . this bridge was also the longest suspension bridge in the world from its opening until 1903 , and is the first steel-wire suspension bridge .
chopin 's disease and the cause of his death have since been a matter of discussion . his death certificate gave the cause as tuberculosis , and his physician , jean cruveilhier , was then the leading french authority on this disease . other possibilities have been advanced including cystic fibrosis , cirrhosis and alpha 1-antitrypsin deficiency . however , the attribution of tuberculosis as principal cause of death has not been disproved . permission for dna testing , which could put the matter to rest , has been denied by the polish government .

on 21 may , amer asked nasser to order the straits of tiran blockaded , a move nasser believed israel would use as a casus belli . amer reassured him that the army was prepared for confrontation , but nasser doubted amer 's assessment of the military 's readiness . according to nasser 's vice president zakaria mohieddin , although " amer had absolute authority over the armed forces , nasser had his ways of knowing what was really going on . " moreover , amer anticipated an impending israeli attack and advocated a preemptive strike . nasser refused the call upon determination that the air force lacked pilots and amer 's handpicked officers were incompetent . still , nasser concluded that if israel attacked , egypt 's quantitative advantage in manpower and arms could stave off israeli forces for at least two weeks , allowing for diplomacy towards a ceasefire . towards the end of may , nasser increasingly exchanged his positions of deterrence for deference to the inevitability of war , under increased pressure to act by both the general arab populace and various arab governments . on 26 may nasser declared , " our basic objective will be to destroy israel . " on 30 may , king hussein committed jordan in an alliance with egypt and syria .

one significant part of treaty making is that signing a treaty implies recognition that the other side is a sovereign state and that the agreement being considered is enforceable under international law . hence , nations can be very careful about terming an agreement to be a treaty . for example , within the united states , agreements between states are compacts and agreements between states and the federal government or between agencies of the government are memoranda of understanding .

mandolin awareness in the united states blossomed in the 1880s , as the instrument became part of a fad that continued into the mid-1920s . according to clarence l. partee , the first mandolin made in the united states was made in 1883 or 1884 by joseph bohmann , who was an established maker of violins in chicago . partee characterized the early instrument as being larger than the european instruments he was used to , with a " peculiar shape " and " crude construction , " and said that the quality improved , until american instruments were " superior " to imported instruments . at the time , partee was using an imported french-made mandolin .
due to industrial restructuring and loss of jobs in the auto industry , detroit lost considerable population from the late 20th century to present . between 2000 and 2010 the city 's population fell by 25 percent , changing its ranking from the nation 's 10th-largest city to 18th . in 2010 , the city had a population of 713,777 , more than a 60 percent drop from a peak population of over 1.8 million at the 1950 census . this resulted from suburbanization , industrial restructuring , and the decline of detroit 's auto industry . following the shift of population and jobs to its suburbs or other states or nations , the city has focused on becoming the metropolitan region 's employment and economic center . downtown detroit has held an increased role as an entertainment destination in the 21st century , with the restoration of several historic theatres , several new sports stadiums , and a riverfront revitalization project . more recently , the population of downtown detroit , midtown detroit , and a handful of other neighborhoods has increased . many other neighborhoods remain distressed , with extensive abandonment of properties .
more than half of the jews live in the diaspora ( see population table ) . currently , the largest jewish community outside israel , and either the largest or second-largest jewish community in the world , is located in the united states , with 5.2 million to 6.4 million jews by various estimates . elsewhere in the americas , there are also large jewish populations in canada ( 315,000 ) , argentina ( 180,000-300,000 ) , and brazil ( 196,000-600,000 ) , and smaller populations in mexico , uruguay , venezuela , chile , colombia and several other countries ( see history of the jews in latin america ) . demographers disagree on whether the united states has a larger jewish population than israel , with many maintaining that israel surpassed the united states in jewish population during the 2000s , while others maintain that the united states still has the largest jewish population in the world . currently , a major national jewish population survey is planned to ascertain whether or not israel has overtaken the united states in jewish population .

scientific academies and societies grew out of the scientific revolution as the creators of scientific knowledge in contrast to the scholasticism of the university . during the enlightenment , some societies created or retained links to universities . however , contemporary sources distinguished universities from scientific societies by claiming that the university 's utility was in the transmission of knowledge , while societies functioned to create knowledge . as the role of universities in institutionalized science began to diminish , learned societies became the cornerstone of organized science . official scientific societies were chartered by the state in order to provide technical expertise . most societies were granted permission to oversee their own publications , control the election of new members , and the administration of the society . after 1700 , a tremendous number of official academies and societies were founded in europe , and by 1789 there were over seventy official scientific societies . in reference to this growth , bernard de fontenelle coined the term " the age of academies " to describe the 18th century .
express highways such as hu-ning , ning-he , ning-hang enable commuters to travel to shanghai , hefei , hangzhou , and other important cities quickly and conveniently . inside the city of nanjing , there are 230 km ( 140 mi ) of highways , with a highway coverage density of 3.38 kilometres per hundred square kilometrs ( 5.44 mi / 100 sq mi ) . the total road coverage density of the city is 112.56 kilometres per hundred square kilometres ( 181.15 mi / 100 sq mi ) . the two artery roads in nanjing are zhongshan road and hanzhong . the two roads cross in the city centre , xinjiekou .
after boiling , the hopped wort is now cooled , ready for the yeast . in some breweries , the hopped wort may pass through a hopback , which is a small vat filled with hops , to add aromatic hop flavouring and to act as a filter ; but usually the hopped wort is simply cooled for the fermenter , where the yeast is added . during fermentation , the wort becomes beer in a process which requires a week to months depending on the type of yeast and strength of the beer . in addition to producing ethanol , fine particulate matter suspended in the wort settles during fermentation . once fermentation is complete , the yeast also settles , leaving the beer clear .
until the 19th century , religion played a significant role in university curriculum ; however , the role of religion in research universities decreased in the 19th century , and by the end of the 19th century , the german university model had spread around the world . universities concentrated on science in the 19th and 20th centuries and became increasingly accessible to the masses . in britain , the move from industrial revolution to modernity saw the arrival of new civic universities with an emphasis on science and engineering , a movement initiated in 1960 by sir keith murray ( chairman of the university grants committee ) and sir samuel curran , with the formation of the university of strathclyde . the british also established universities worldwide , and higher education became available to the masses not only in europe .

a necessary condition for the aforementioned reciprocity property is that the materials in the antenna and transmission medium are linear and reciprocal . reciprocal ( or bilateral ) means that the material has the same response to an electric current or magnetic field in one direction , as it has to the field or current in the opposite direction . most materials used in antennas meet these conditions , but some microwave antennas use high-tech components such as isolators and circulators , made of nonreciprocal materials such as ferrite . these can be used to give the antenna a different behavior on receiving than it has on transmitting , which can be useful in applications like radar .
southern europe 's flora is that of the mediterranean region , one of the phytochoria recognized by armen takhtajan . the mediterranean and submediterranean climate regions in europe are found in much of southern europe , mainly in southern portugal , most of spain , the southern coast of france , italy , the croatian coast , much of bosnia , montenegro , albania , macedonia , greece , and the mediterranean islands .
magic was practiced widely , and these too , were a continuation from earlier times . throughout the hellenistic world , people would consult oracles , and use charms and figurines to deter misfortune or to cast spells . also developed in this era was the complex system of astrology , which sought to determine a person 's character and future in the movements of the sun , moon , and planets . astrology was widely associated with the cult of tyche ( luck , fortune ) , which grew in popularity during this period .
switzerland voted against membership in the european economic area in a referendum in december 1992 and has since maintained and developed its relationships with the european union ( eu ) and european countries through bilateral agreements . in march 2001 , the swiss people refused in a popular vote to start accession negotiations with the eu . in recent years , the swiss have brought their economic practices largely into conformity with those of the eu in many ways , in an effort to enhance their international competitiveness . the economy grew at 3 % in 2010 , 1.9 % in 2011 , and 1 % in 2012 . full eu membership is a long-term objective of some in the swiss government , but there is considerable popular sentiment against this supported by the conservative svp party . the western french-speaking areas and the urban regions of the rest of the country tend to be more pro-eu , however with far from any significant share of the population .
this can give rise to the situation in which two dialects ( defined according to this paradigm ) with a somewhat distant genetic relationship are mutually more readily comprehensible than more closely related dialects . in one opinion , this pattern is clearly present among the modern romance languages , with italian and spanish having a high degree of mutual comprehensibility , which neither language shares with french , despite some claiming that both languages are genetically closer to french than to each other : [ citation needed ] in fact , french-italian and french-spanish relative mutual incomprehensibility is due to french having undergone more rapid and more pervasive phonological change than have spanish and italian , not to real or imagined distance in genetic relationship . in fact , italian and french share many more root words in common that do not even appear in spanish .
rescue efforts performed by the chinese government were praised by western media , especially in comparison with myanmar 's blockage of foreign aid during cyclone nargis , as well as china 's previous performance during the 1976 tangshan earthquake . china 's openness during the media coverage of the sichuan earthquake led a professor at the peking university to say , " this is the first time [ that ] the chinese media has lived up to international standards . " los angeles times praised china 's media coverage of the quake of being " democratic . "
the fluid in the coelomata contains coelomocyte cells that defend the animals against parasites and infections . in some species coelomocytes may also contain a respiratory pigment - red hemoglobin in some species , green chlorocruorin in others ( dissolved in the plasma ) - and provide oxygen transport within their segments . respiratory pigment is also dissolved in the blood plasma . species with well-developed septa generally also have blood vessels running all long their bodies above and below the gut , the upper one carrying blood forwards while the lower one carries it backwards . networks of capillaries in the body wall and around the gut transfer blood between the main blood vessels and to parts of the segment that need oxygen and nutrients . both of the major vessels , especially the upper one , can pump blood by contracting . in some annelids the forward end of the upper blood vessel is enlarged with muscles to form a heart , while in the forward ends of many earthworms some of the vessels that connect the upper and lower main vessels function as hearts . species with poorly developed or no septa generally have no blood vessels and rely on the circulation within the coelom for delivering nutrients and oxygen .

there are many approaches available in software testing . reviews , walkthroughs , or inspections are referred to as static testing , whereas actually executing programmed code with a given set of test cases is referred to as dynamic testing . static testing is often implicit , as proofreading , plus when programming tools / text editors check source code structure or compilers ( pre-compilers ) check syntax and data flow as static program analysis . dynamic testing takes place when the program itself is run . dynamic testing may begin before the program is 100 % complete in order to test particular sections of code and are applied to discrete functions or modules . typical techniques for this are either using stubs / drivers or execution from a debugger environment .
raymond b. bragg , the associate editor of the new humanist , sought to consolidate the input of leon milton birkhead , charles francis potter , and several members of the western unitarian conference . bragg asked roy wood sellars to draft a document based on this information which resulted in the publication of the humanist manifesto in 1933 . potter 's book and the manifesto became the cornerstones of modern humanism , the latter declaring a new religion by saying , " any religion that can hope to be a synthesising and dynamic force for today must be shaped for the needs of this age . to establish such a religion is a major necessity of the present . " it then presented 15 theses of humanism as foundational principles for this new religion .
paul vi opened the third period on 14 september 1964 , telling the council fathers that he viewed the text about the church as the most important document to come out from the council . as the council discussed the role of bishops in the papacy , paul vi issued an explanatory note confirming the primacy of the papacy , a step which was viewed by some as meddling in the affairs of the council american bishops pushed for a speedy resolution on religious freedom , but paul vi insisted this to be approved together with related texts such as ecumenism . the pope concluded the session on 21 november 1964 , with the formal pronouncement of mary as mother of the church .
prayer plays a significant role among many believers . muslims believe that the purpose of existence is to worship god . he is viewed as a personal god and there are no intermediaries , such as clergy , to contact god . prayer often also includes supplication and asking forgiveness . god is often believed to be forgiving . for example , a hadith states god would replace a sinless people with one who sinned but still asked repentance . christian theologian alister mcgrath writes that there are good reasons to suggest that a " personal god " is integral to the christian outlook , but that one has to understand it is an analogy . " to say that god is like a person is to affirm the divine ability and willingness to relate to others . this does not imply that god is human , or located at a specific point in the universe . "
the age of the earth is about 4.54 billion years old . the earliest undisputed evidence of life on earth dates at least from 3.5 billion years ago , during the eoarchean era after a geological crust started to solidify following the earlier molten hadean eon . there are microbial mat fossils found in 3.48 billion-year-old sandstone discovered in western australia . other early physical evidence of a biogenic substance is graphite in 3.7 billion-year-old metasedimentary rocks discovered in western greenland . more recently , in 2015 , " remains of biotic life " were found in 4.1 billion-year-old rocks in western australia . according to one of the researchers , " if life arose relatively quickly on earth ... then it could be common in the universe . "
after almost a year in the area around peenemunde , soviet officials moved most of the captured german rocket specialists to gorodomlya island on lake seliger , about 240 kilometers ( 150 mi ) northwest of moscow . they were not allowed to participate in soviet missile design , but were used as problem-solving consultants to the soviet engineers . they helped in the following areas : the creation of a soviet version of the a-4 ; work on " organizational schemes " ; research in improving the a-4 main engine ; development of a 100-ton engine ; assistance in the " layout " of plant production rooms ; and preparation of rocket assembly using german components . with their help , particularly helmut groettrup 's group , korolev reverse-engineered the a-4 and built his own version of the rocket , the r-1 , in 1948 . later , he developed his own distinct designs , though many of these designs were influenced by the groettrup group 's g4-r10 design from 1949 . the germans were eventually repatriated in 1951-53 .
during the first half of the 1920s , engineers at western electric , as well as independent inventors such as orlando marsh , developed technology for capturing sound with a microphone , amplifying it with vacuum tubes , then using the amplified signal to drive an electromagnetic recording head . western electric 's innovations resulted in a greatly expanded and more even frequency response , creating a dramatically fuller , clearer and more natural-sounding recording . distant or less strong sounds that were impossible to record by the old methods could now be captured . volume was now limited only by the groove spacing on the record and the limitations of the intended playback device . victor and columbia licensed the new electrical system from western electric and began issuing electrically recorded discs in 1925 . the first classical recording was of chopin impromptus and schubert 's litanei by alfred cortot for victor .

while the federal district was ruled by the federal government through an appointed governor , the municipalities within it were autonomous , and this duality of powers created tension between the municipalities and the federal government for more than a century . in 1903 , porfirio diaz largely reduced the powers of the municipalities within the federal district . eventually , in december 1928 , the federal government decided to abolish all the municipalities of the federal district . in place of the municipalities , the federal district was divided into one " central department " and 13 delegaciones ( boroughs ) administered directly by the government of the federal district . the central department was integrated by the former municipalities of mexico city , tacuba , tacubaya and mixcoac .
the only cosmetic difference between an rlv disc and a regular factory-pressed laserdiscs is their reflective purple-violet ( or blue with some rlv discs ) color resulting from the dye embedded in the reflective layer of the disc to make it recordable , as opposed to the silver mirror appearance of regular lds . the purplish color of rlvs is very similar to dvd-r and dvd + r discs . rlvs were popular for making short-run quantities of laserdiscs for specialized applications such as interactive kiosks and flight simulators .
when the xbox 360 was released , microsoft 's online gaming service xbox live was shut down for 24 hours and underwent a major upgrade , adding a basic non-subscription service called xbox live silver ( later renamed xbox live free ) to its already established premium subscription-based service ( which was renamed gold ) . xbox live free is included with all skus of the console . it allows users to create a user profile , join on message boards , and access microsoft 's xbox live arcade and marketplace and talk to other members . a live free account does not generally support multiplayer gaming ; however , some games that have rather limited online functions already , ( such as viva pinata ) or games that feature their own subscription service ( e.g. ea sports games ) can be played with a free account . xbox live also supports voice the latter a feature possible with the xbox live vision .

the migration of birds also aids the movement of other species , including those of ectoparasites such as ticks and lice , which in turn may carry micro-organisms including those of concern to human health . due to the global spread of avian influenza , bird migration has been studied as a possible mechanism of disease transmission , but it has been found not to present a special risk ; import of pet and domestic birds is a greater threat . some viruses that are maintained in birds without lethal effects , such as the west nile virus may however be spread by migrating birds . birds may also have a role in the dispersal of propagules of plants and plankton .
in the netherlands , the supreme court of the netherlands is the highest . its decisions , known as " arresten , " are absolutely final . the court is banned from testing legislation against the constitution , pursuant to the principle of the sovereignty of the states-general ; the court can , however , test legislation against some treaties . also , the ordinary courts in the netherlands , including the hoge raad , do not deal with administrative law , which is dealt with in separate administrative courts , the highest of which is the council of state ( raad van state )
the vaisesika philosophy is a naturalist school ; it is a form of atomism in natural philosophy . it postulated that all objects in the physical universe are reducible to paramanu ( atoms ) , and one 's experiences are derived from the interplay of substance ( a function of atoms , their number and their spatial arrangements ) , quality , activity , commonness , particularity and inherence . knowledge and liberation was achievable by complete understanding of the world of experience , according to vaisesika school . the vaisesika darsana is credited to kanada kasyapa from the second half of the first millennium bce . the foundational text , the vaisesika sutra , opens as follows ,

the baroque style had never truly been to the english taste . four influential books were published in the first quarter of the 18th century which highlighted the simplicity and purity of classical architecture : vitruvius britannicus ( colen campbell 1715 ) , palladio 's four books of architecture ( 1715 ) , de re aedificatoria ( 1726 ) and the designs of inigo jones ... with some additional designs ( 1727 ) . the most popular was the four-volume vitruvius britannicus by colen campbell . the book contained architectural prints of famous british buildings that had been inspired by the great architects from vitruvius to palladio . at first the book mainly featured the work of inigo jones , but the later tomes contained drawings and plans by campbell and other 18th-century architects . palladian architecture became well established in 18th-century britain .
chasetown , whilst playing at level 8 of english football during the 2007-08 competition , are the lowest-ranked team to play in the third round proper ( final 64 , of 731 teams entered that season ) . chasetown was then a member of the southern league division one midlands ( a lower level within the southern football league ) , when they lost to football league championship ( level 2 ) team cardiff city , the eventual fa cup runners-up that year . their success earned the lowly organisation over £ 60,000 in prize money .
despite his success as a producer , west 's true aspiration was to be a rapper . though he had developed his rapping long before he began producing , it was often a challenge for west to be accepted as a rapper , and he struggled to attain a record deal . multiple record companies ignored him because he did not portray the gangsta image prominent in mainstream hip hop at the time . after a series of meetings with capitol records , west was ultimately denied an artist deal .
the new state became a focal point for the emerging oil industry , as discoveries of oil pools prompted towns to grow rapidly in population and wealth . tulsa eventually became known as the " oil capital of the world " for most of the 20th century and oil investments fueled much of the state 's early economy . in 1927 , oklahoman businessman cyrus avery , known as the " father of route 66 , " began the campaign to create u.s. route 66 . using a stretch of highway from amarillo , texas to tulsa , oklahoma to form the original portion of highway 66 , avery spearheaded the creation of the u.s. highway 66 association to oversee the planning of route 66 , based in his hometown of tulsa .
the situation became so tense that war with the united states seemed imminent . on april 22 , 1914 , on the initiative of felix a. sommerfeld and sherburne hopkins , pancho villa traveled to juarez to calm fears along the border and asked president wilson 's emissary george carothers to tell " senor wilson " that he had no problems with the american occupation of veracruz . carothers wrote to secretary william jennings bryan : " as far as he was concerned we could keep vera cruz [ sic ] and hold it so tight that not even water could get in to huerta and . . . he could not feel any resentment . " whether trying to please the u.s. government or through the diplomatic efforts of sommerfeld and carothers , or maybe as a result of both , villa stepped out from under carranza 's stated foreign policy .
the inevitable march to civil war and the combat in madrid resulted in the removal of the capital of the republic to valencia . on 6 november 1936 the city became the capital of republican spain under the control of the prime minister manuel azana ; the government moved to the palau de benicarlo , its ministries occupying various other buildings . the city was heavily bombarded by air and sea , necessitating the construction of over two hundred bomb shelters to protect the population . on 13 january 1937 the city was first shelled by a vessel of the fascist italian navy , which was blockading the port by the order of benito mussolini . the bombardment intensified and inflicted massive destruction on several occasions ; by the end of the war the city had survived 442 bombardments , leaving 2,831 dead and 847 wounded , although it is estimated that the death toll was higher , as the data given are those recognised by francisco franco 's government . the republican government passed to juan negrin on 17 may 1937 and on 31 october of that year moved to barcelona . on 30 march 1939 valencia surrendered and the nationalist troops entered the city . the postwar years were a time of hardship for valencians . during franco 's regime speaking or teaching valencian was prohibited ; in a significant reversal it is now compulsory for every schoolchild in valencia .
multi-color leds offer not merely another means to form white light but a new means to form light of different colors . most perceivable colors can be formed by mixing different amounts of three primary colors . this allows precise dynamic color control . as more effort is devoted to investigating this method , multi-color leds should have profound influence on the fundamental method that we use to produce and control light color . however , before this type of led can play a role on the market , several technical problems must be solved . these include that this type of led 's emission power decays exponentially with rising temperature , resulting in a substantial change in color stability . such problems inhibit and may preclude industrial use . thus , many new package designs aimed at solving this problem have been proposed and their results are now being reproduced by researchers and scientists .
testimony given to the financial crisis inquiry commission by richard m. bowen iii on events during his tenure as the business chief underwriter for correspondent lending in the consumer lending group for citigroup ( where he was responsible for over 220 professional underwriters ) suggests that by the final years of the u.s. housing bubble ( 2006-2007 ) , the collapse of mortgage underwriting standards was endemic . his testimony stated that by 2006 , 60 % of mortgages purchased by citi from some 1,600 mortgage companies were " defective " ( were not underwritten to policy , or did not contain all policy-required documents ) - this , despite the fact that each of these 1,600 originators was contractually responsible ( certified via representations and warrantees ) that its mortgage originations met citi 's standards . moreover , during 2007 , " defective mortgages ( from mortgage originators contractually bound to perform underwriting to citi 's standards ) increased ... to over 80 % of production . "
dvaitadvaita was proposed by nimbarka , a 13th-century vaishnava philosopher from the andhra region . according to this philosophy there are three categories of existence : brahman , soul , and matter . soul and matter are different from brahman in that they have attributes and capacities different from brahman . brahman exists independently , while soul and matter are dependent . thus soul and matter have an existence that is separate yet dependent . further , brahman is a controller , the soul is the enjoyer , and matter the thing enjoyed . also , the highest object of worship is krishna and his consort radha , attended by thousands of gopis ; of the vrindavan ; and devotion consists in self-surrender .
congress acted defiantly toward the supreme court by passing the drug kingpin act of 1988 and the federal death penalty act of 1994 that made roughly fifty crimes punishable by death , including crimes that do not always involve the death of someone . such non-death capital offenses include treason , espionage ( spying for another country ) , and high-level drug trafficking . since no one has yet been sentenced to death for such non-death capital offenses , the supreme court has not ruled on their constitutionality .
illegal pinning methods include using the ropes for leverage and hooking the opponent 's clothing , which are therefore popular cheating methods for heels , unless certain stipulations make such an advantage legal . such pins as these are rarely seen by the referee ( as they have to see if their shoulders are down ) and are subsequently often used by heels and on occasion by cheating faces to win matches . even if it is noticed , it is rare for such an attempt to result in a disqualification ( see below ) , and instead it simply results in nullification of the pin attempt , so the heel wrestler rarely has anything to lose for trying it , anyway .
in 1965 , paul vi decided on the creation of a joint working group with the world council of churches to map all possible avenues of dialogue and cooperation . in the following three years , eight sessions were held which resulted in many joint proposals . it was proposed to work closely together in areas of social justice and development and third world issues such as hunger and poverty . on the religious side , it was agreed to share together in the week of prayer for christian unity , to be held every year . the joint working group was to prepare texts which were to be used by all christians . on 19 july 1968 , the meeting of the world council of churches took place in uppsala , sweden , which pope paul called a sign of the times . he sent his blessing in an ecumenical manner : " may the lord bless everything you do for the case of christian unity . " the world council of churches decided on including catholic theologians in its committees , provided they have the backing of the vatican .
the royal australian navy is in the process of procuring two canberra-class lhd 's , the first of which was commissioned in november 2015 , while the second is expected to enter service in 2016 . the ships will be the largest in australian naval history . their primary roles are to embark , transport and deploy an embarked force and to carry out or support humanitarian assistance missions . the lhd is capable of launching multiple helicopters at one time while maintaining an amphibious capability of 1,000 troops and their supporting vehicles ( tanks , armoured personnel carriers etc . ) . the australian defence minister has publicly raised the possibility of procuring f-35b stovl aircraft for the carrier , stating that it " has been on the table since day one and stating the lhd 's are " stovl capable . "
in 1963 , the robbins report on universities in the united kingdom concluded that such institutions should have four main " objectives essential to any properly balanced system : instruction in skills ; the promotion of the general powers of the mind so as to produce not mere specialists but rather cultivated men and women ; to maintain research in balance with teaching , since teaching should not be separated from the advancement of learning and the search for truth ; and to transmit a common culture and common standards of citizenship .

in particle physics , this inequality permits a qualitative understanding of virtual particles which carry momentum , exchange by which and with real particles , is responsible for the creation of all known fundamental forces ( more accurately known as fundamental interactions ) . virtual photons ( which are simply lowest quantum mechanical energy state of photons ) are also responsible for electrostatic interaction between electric charges ( which results in coulomb law ) , for spontaneous radiative decay of exited atomic and nuclear states , for the casimir force , for van der waals bond forces and some other observable phenomena .
however loss resistance will generally affect the feedpoint impedance , adding to its resistive ( real ) component . that resistance will consist of the sum of the radiation resistance rr and the loss resistance rloss . if an rms current i is delivered to the terminals of an antenna , then a power of i2rr will be radiated and a power of i2rloss will be lost as heat . therefore , the efficiency of an antenna is equal to rr / ( rr + rloss ) . of course only the total resistance rr + rloss can be directly measured .
the city generally has a climate with warm days followed by cool nights and mornings . unpredictable weather is expected , given that temperatures can drop to 1 ° c ( 34 ° f ) or less during the winter . during a 2013 cold front , the winter temperatures of kathmandu dropped to − 4 ° c ( 25 ° f ) , and the lowest temperature was recorded on january 10 , 2013 , at − 9.2 ° c ( 15.4 ° f ) . rainfall is mostly monsoon-based ( about 65 % of the total concentrated during the monsoon months of june to august ) , and decreases substantially ( 100 to 200 cm ( 39 to 79 in ) ) from eastern nepal to western nepal . rainfall has been recorded at about 1,400 millimetres ( 55.1 in ) for the kathmandu valley , and averages 1,407 millimetres ( 55.4 in ) for the city of kathmandu . on average humidity is 75 % . the chart below is based on data from the nepal bureau of standards & meteorology , " weather meteorology " for 2005 . the chart provides minimum and maximum temperatures during each month . the annual amount of precipitation was 1,124 millimetres ( 44.3 in ) for 2005 , as per monthly data included in the table above . the decade of 2000-2010 saw highly variable and unprecedented precipitation anomalies in kathmandu . this was mostly due to the annual variation of the southwest monsoon . [ citation needed ] for example , 2003 was the wettest year ever in kathmandu , totalling over 2,900 mm ( 114 in ) of precipitation due to an exceptionally strong monsoon season . in contrast , 2001 recorded only 356 mm ( 14 in ) of precipitation due to an extraordinarily weak monsoon season .
saint-barthelemy ( french : saint-barthelemy , french pronunciation : [ sɛ  baʁtelemi ] ) , officially the territorial collectivity of saint-barthelemy ( french : collectivite territoriale de saint-barthelemy ) , is an overseas collectivity of france . often abbreviated to saint-barth in french , or st. barts or st. barths in english , the indigenous people called the island ouanalao . st. barthelemy lies about 35 kilometres ( 22 mi ) southeast of st. martin and north of st. kitts . puerto rico is 240 kilometres ( 150 mi ) to the west in the greater antilles .
in the eastern empire the slow infiltration of the balkans by the slavs added a further difficulty for justinian 's successors . it began gradually , but by the late 540s slavic tribes were in thrace and illyrium , and had defeated an imperial army near adrianople in 551 . in the 560s the avars began to expand from their base on the north bank of the danube ; by the end of the 6th century they were the dominant power in central europe and routinely able to force the eastern emperors to pay tribute . they remained a strong power until 796 . an additional problem to face the empire came as a result of the involvement of emperor maurice ( r . 582-602 ) in persian politics when he intervened in a succession dispute . this led to a period of peace , but when maurice was overthrown , the persians invaded and during the reign of emperor heraclius ( r . 610-641 ) controlled large chunks of the empire , including egypt , syria , and asia minor , until heraclius ' successful counterattack . in 628 the empire secured a peace treaty and recovered all of its lost territories .
houston is recognized worldwide for its energy industry - particularly for oil and natural gas - as well as for biomedical research and aeronautics . renewable energy sources - wind and solar - are also growing economic bases in the city . the houston ship channel is also a large part of houston 's economic base . because of these strengths , houston is designated as a global city by the globalization and world cities study group and network and global management consulting firm a.t. kearney . the houston area is the top u.s. market for exports , surpassing new york city in 2013 , according to data released by the u.s. department of commerce 's international trade administration . in 2012 , the houston-the woodlands-sugar land area recorded $ 110.3 billion in merchandise exports . petroleum products , chemicals , and oil and gas extraction equipment accounted for approximately two-thirds of the metropolitan area 's exports last year . the top 3 destinations for exports were mexico , canada , and brazil .
the causes of the franco-prussian war are deeply rooted in the events surrounding the unification of germany . in the aftermath of the austro-prussian war of 1866 , prussia had annexed numerous territories and formed the north german confederation . this new power destabilized the european balance of power established by the congress of vienna in 1815 after the napoleonic wars . napoleon iii , then the emperor of france , demanded compensations in belgium and on the left bank of the rhine to secure france 's strategic position , which the prussian chancellor , otto von bismarck , flatly refused . prussia then turned its attention towards the south of germany , where it sought to incorporate the southern german kingdoms , bavaria , wurttemberg , baden and hesse-darmstadt , into a unified prussia-dominated germany . france was strongly opposed to any further alliance of german states , which would have significantly strengthened the prussian military .
this unified institution consists of sea , land , and air elements referred to as the royal canadian navy ( rcn ) , canadian army , and royal canadian air force ( rcaf ) . personnel may belong to either the regular force or the reserve force , which has four sub-components : the primary reserve , supplementary reserve , cadet organizations administration and training service , and the canadian rangers . under the national defence act , the canadian armed forces are an entity separate and distinct from the department of national defence ( the federal government department responsible for administration and formation of defence policy ) , which also exists as the civilian support system for the forces .
during the partitions of poland from 1772 to 1795 , its members began to lose these legal privileges and social status . from that point until 1918 , the legal status of the nobility was essentially dependent upon the policies of the three partitioning powers : the russian empire , the kingdom of prussia , and the habsburg monarchy . the legal privileges of the szlachta were legally abolished in the second polish republic by the march constitution of 1921 .
by the 1980s , parents of mixed-race children ( and adults of mixed-race ancestry ) began to organize and lobby for the ability to show more than one ethnic category on census and other legal forms . they refused to be put into just one category . when the u.s. government proposed the addition of the category of " bi-racial " or " multiracial " in 1988 , the response from the general public was mostly negative . some african-american organizations and political leaders , such as senator diane watson and representative augustus hawkins , were particularly vocal in their rejection of the category . they feared a loss in political and economic power if african americans abandoned their one category .
many minerals provide pigments which have been used in green paints and dyes over the centuries . pigments , in this case , are minerals which reflect the color green , rather that emitting it through luminescent or phosphorescent qualities . the large number of green pigments makes it impossible to mention them all . among the more notable green minerals , however is the emerald , which is colored green by trace amounts of chromium and sometimes vanadium . chromium ( iii ) oxide ( cr2o3 ) , is called chrome green , also called viridian or institutional green when used as a pigment . for many years , the source of amazonite 's color was a mystery . widely thought to have been due to copper because copper compounds often have blue and green colors , the blue-green color is likely to be derived from small quantities of lead and water in the feldspar . copper is the source of the green color in malachite pigments , chemically known as basic copper ( ii ) carbonate .
although the tories were dismissed from office for half a century , for most of this period ( at first under the leadership of sir william wyndham ) , the tories retained party cohesion , with occasional hopes of regaining office , particularly at the accession of george ii ( 1727 ) and the downfall of the ministry of sir robert walpole in 1742 . they acted as a united , though unavailing , opposition to whig corruption and scandals . at times they cooperated with the " opposition whigs , " whigs who were in opposition to the whig government ; however , the ideological gap between the tories and the opposition whigs prevented them from coalescing as a single party . they finally regained power with the accession of george iii in 1760 under lord bute .
the acta constitutiva de la federacion of january 31 , 1824 , and the federal constitution of october 4 , 1824 , fixed the political and administrative organization of the united mexican states after the mexican war of independence . in addition , section xxviii of article 50 gave the new congress the right to choose where the federal government would be located . this location would then be appropriated as federal land , with the federal government acting as the local authority . the two main candidates to become the capital were mexico city and queretaro .
trading companies became active in tuvalu in the mid-19th century ; the trading companies engaged palagi traders who lived on the islands . john ( also known as jack ) o 'brien was the first european to settle in tuvalu , he became a trader on funafuti in the 1850s . he married salai , the daughter of the paramount chief of funafuti . louis becke , who later found success as a writer , was a trader on nanumanga from april 1880 until the trading-station was destroyed later that year in a cyclone . he then became a trader on nukufetau .
various industrial businesses are located in hannover . the volkswagen commercial vehicles transporter ( vwn ) factory at hannover-stocken is the biggest employer in the region and operates a huge plant at the northern edge of town adjoining the mittellandkanal and motorway a2 . jointly with a factory of german tire and automobile parts manufacturer continental ag , they have a coal-burning power plant . continental ag , founded in hanover in 1871 , is one of the city 's major companies , as is sennheiser . since 2008 a take-over is in progress : the schaeffler group from herzogenaurach ( bavaria ) holds the majority of the stock but were required due to the financial crisis to deposit the options as securities at banks . tui ag has its hq in hanover . hanover is home to many insurance companies , many of which operate only in germany . one major global reinsurance company is hannover re , whose headquarters are east of the city centre .
after the rupture of the wars with portugal and catalonia , the junta changed its attitude , this time due to the exhaustion of galicia , now involved not just in naval or oversea operations , but also in an exhausting war with the portuguese , war which produced thousands of casualties and refugees and was heavily disturbing to the local economy and commerce . so , in the second half of the 17th century the junta frequently denied or considerably reduced the initial petitions of the monarch , and though the tension didn 't rise to the levels experienced in portugal or catalonia , there were frequent urban mutinies and some voices even asked for the secession of the kingdom of galicia .
beyonce giselle knowles-carter ( / biːˈjɒnseɪ / bee-yon-say ) ( born september 4 , 1981 ) is an american singer , songwriter , record producer and actress . born and raised in houston , texas , she performed in various singing and dancing competitions as a child , and rose to fame in the late 1990s as lead singer of r & b girl-group destiny 's child . managed by her father , mathew knowles , the group became one of the world 's best-selling girl groups of all time . their hiatus saw the release of beyonce 's debut album , dangerously in love ( 2003 ) , which established her as a solo artist worldwide , earned five grammy awards and featured the billboard hot 100 number-one singles " crazy in love " and " baby boy . "
british imperial strength was underpinned by the steamship and the telegraph , new technologies invented in the second half of the 19th century , allowing it to control and defend the empire . by 1902 , the british empire was linked together by a network of telegraph cables , the so-called all red line . growing until 1922 , around 13,000,000 square miles ( 34,000,000 km2 ) of territory and roughly 458 million people were added to the british empire . the british established colonies in australia in 1788 , new zealand in 1840 and fiji in 1872 , with much of oceania becoming part of the british empire .
the axis states which assisted japan included the authoritarian government of thailand in world war ii , which quickly formed a temporary alliance with the japanese in 1941 , as the japanese forces were already invading the peninsula of southern thailand . the phayap army sent troops to invade and occupy northeastern burma , which was former thai territory that had been annexed by britain much earlier . also involved were the japanese puppet states of manchukuo and mengjiang ( consisting of most of manchuria and parts of inner mongolia respectively ) , and the collaborationist wang jingwei regime ( which controlled the coastal regions of china ) .
all youtube users can upload videos up to 15 minutes each in duration . users who have a good track record of complying with the site 's community guidelines may be offered the ability to upload videos up to 12 hours in length , which requires verifying the account , normally through a mobile phone . when youtube was launched in 2005 , it was possible to upload long videos , but a ten-minute limit was introduced in march 2006 after youtube found that the majority of videos exceeding this length were unauthorized uploads of television shows and films . the 10-minute limit was increased to 15 minutes in july 2010 . if an up-to-date browser version is used , videos greater than 20 gb can be uploaded .
major league baseball is especially well known for red teams . the cincinnati red stockings are the oldest professional baseball team , dating back to 1869 . the franchise soon relocated to boston and is now the atlanta braves , but its name survives as the origin for both the cincinnati reds and boston red sox . during the 1950s when red was strongly associated with communism , the modern cincinnati team was known as the " redlegs " and the term was used on baseball cards . after the red scare faded , the team was known as the " reds " again . the los angeles angels of anaheim are also known for their color red , as are the st. louis cardinals , arizona diamondbacks , and the philadelphia phillies .
there was a linguistic predisposition to use such terms . the romans had used them in near gaul / far gaul , near spain / far spain and others . before them the greeks had the habit , which appears in linear b , the oldest known script of europe , referring to the near province and the far province of the kingdom of pylos . usually these terms were given with reference to a geographic feature , such as a mountain range or a river .
in ancient rome , tyrian purple was the color of the emperor , but red had an important religious symbolism . romans wore togas with red stripes on holidays , and the bride at a wedding wore a red shawl , called a flammeum . red was used to color statues and the skin of gladiators . red was also the color associated with army ; roman soldiers wore red tunics , and officers wore a cloak called a paludamentum which , depending upon the quality of the dye , could be crimson , scarlet or purple . in roman mythology red is associated with the god of war , mars . the vexilloid of the roman empire had a red background with the letters spqr in gold . a roman general receiving a triumph had his entire body painted red in honor of his achievement .
in october 2015 , tcm announced the launch of the tcm wineclub , in which they teamed up with laithwaite to provide a line of mail-order wines from famous vineyards such as famed writer-director-producer francis ford coppola 's winery . wines are available in 3 month subscriptions , and can be selected as reds , whites , or a mixture of both . from the wines chosen , tcm also includes recommended movies to watch with each , such as a " true grit " wine , to be paired with the john wayne film of the same name .
in response , apple introduced a range of relatively inexpensive macs in october 1990 . the macintosh classic , essentially a less expensive version of the macintosh se , was the least expensive mac offered until early 2001 . the 68020-powered macintosh lc , in its distinctive " pizza box " case , offered color graphics and was accompanied by a new , low-cost 512 × 384 pixel monitor . the macintosh iisi was essentially a 20 mhz iici with only one expansion slot . all three machines sold well , although apple 's profit margin on them was considerably lower than that on earlier models .
richmond has several historic churches . because of its early english colonial history from the early 17th century to 1776 , richmond has a number of prominent anglican / episcopal churches including monumental church , st. paul 's episcopal church and st. john 's episcopal church . methodists and baptists made up another section of early churches , and first baptist church of richmond was the first of these , established in 1780 . in the reformed church tradition , the first presbyterian church in the city of richmond was first presbyterian church , organized on june 18 , 1812 . on february 5 , 1845 , second presbyterian church of richmond was founded , which was a historic church where stonewall jackson attended and was the first gothic building and the first gas-lit church to be built in richmond . st. peter 's church was dedicated and became the first catholic church in richmond on may 25 , 1834 . the city is also home to the historic cathedral of the sacred heart which is the motherchurch for the roman catholic diocese of richmond .
the same considerations about barriers and detours that apply to long-distance land-bird migration apply to water birds , but in reverse : a large area of land without bodies of water that offer feeding sites may also be a barrier to a bird that feeds in coastal waters . detours avoiding such barriers are observed : for example , brent geese branta bernicla migrating from the taymyr peninsula to the wadden sea travel via the white sea coast and the baltic sea rather than directly across the arctic ocean and northern scandinavia .
architecturally , the school has a catholic character . atop the main building 's gold dome is a golden statue of the virgin mary . immediately in front of the main building and facing it , is a copper statue of christ with arms upraised with the legend " venite ad me omnes . " next to the main building is the basilica of the sacred heart . immediately behind the basilica is the grotto , a marian place of prayer and reflection . it is a replica of the grotto at lourdes , france where the virgin mary reputedly appeared to saint bernadette soubirous in 1858 . at the end of the main drive ( and in a direct line that connects through 3 statues and the gold dome ) , is a simple , modern stone statue of mary .
in comparison to the principal alternative , the diesel engine , electric railways offer substantially better energy efficiency , lower emissions and lower operating costs . electric locomotives are usually quieter , more powerful , and more responsive and reliable than diesels . they have no local emissions , an important advantage in tunnels and urban areas . some electric traction systems provide regenerative braking that turns the train 's kinetic energy back into electricity and returns it to the supply system to be used by other trains or the general utility grid . while diesel locomotives burn petroleum , electricity is generated from diverse sources including many that do not produce carbon dioxide such as nuclear power and renewable forms including hydroelectric , geothermal , wind and solar .
devonport dockyard is the uk 's only naval base that refits nuclear submarines and the navy estimates that the dockyard generates about 10 % of plymouth 's income . plymouth has the largest cluster of marine and maritime businesses in the south west with 270 firms operating within the sector . other substantial employers include the university with almost 3,000 staff , as well as the tamar science park employing 500 people in 50 companies . several employers have chosen to locate their headquarters in plymouth , including hemsley fraser .
in the mid-1950s , frank burnet , inspired by a suggestion made by niels jerne , formulated the clonal selection theory ( cst ) of immunity . on the basis of cst , burnet developed a theory of how an immune response is triggered according to the self / nonself distinction : " self " constituents ( constituents of the body ) do not trigger destructive immune responses , while " nonself " entities ( e.g. , pathogens , an allograft ) trigger a destructive immune response . the theory was later modified to reflect new discoveries regarding histocompatibility or the complex " two-signal " activation of t cells . the self / nonself theory of immunity and the self / nonself vocabulary have been criticized , but remain very influential .
at the 1966 " man the hunter " conference , anthropologists richard borshay lee and irven devore suggested that egalitarianism was one of several central characteristics of nomadic hunting and gathering societies because mobility requires minimization of material possessions throughout a population . therefore , no surplus of resources can be accumulated by any single member . other characteristics lee and devore proposed were flux in territorial boundaries as well as in demographic composition .
successful cultivation of cotton requires a long frost-free period , plenty of sunshine , and a moderate rainfall , usually from 600 to 1,200 mm ( 24 to 47 in ) . soils usually need to be fairly heavy , although the level of nutrients does not need to be exceptional . in general , these conditions are met within the seasonally dry tropics and subtropics in the northern and southern hemispheres , but a large proportion of the cotton grown today is cultivated in areas with less rainfall that obtain the water from irrigation . production of the crop for a given year usually starts soon after harvesting the preceding autumn . cotton is naturally a perennial but is grown as an annual to help control pests . planting time in spring in the northern hemisphere varies from the beginning of february to the beginning of june . the area of the united states known as the south plains is the largest contiguous cotton-growing region in the world . while dryland ( non-irrigated ) cotton is successfully grown in this region , consistent yields are only produced with heavy reliance on irrigation water drawn from the ogallala aquifer . since cotton is somewhat salt and drought tolerant , this makes it an attractive crop for arid and semiarid regions . as water resources get tighter around the world , economies that rely on it face difficulties and conflict , as well as potential environmental problems . for example , improper cropping and irrigation practices have led to desertification in areas of uzbekistan , where cotton is a major export . in the days of the soviet union , the aral sea was tapped for agricultural irrigation , largely of cotton , and now salination is widespread .
the original model famicom featured two game controllers , both of which were hardwired to the back of the console . the second controller lacked the start and select buttons , but featured a small microphone . relatively few games made use of this feature . the earliest produced famicom units initially had square a and b buttons . this was changed to the circular designs because of the square buttons being caught in the controller casing when pressed down and glitches within the hardware causing the system to freeze occasionally while playing a game .
nasser 's nomination for the post and the new constitution were put to public referendum on 23 june and each was approved by an overwhelming majority . a 350-member national assembly was established , elections for which were held in july 1957 . nasser had ultimate approval over all the candidates . the constitution granted women 's suffrage , prohibited gender-based discrimination , and entailed special protection for women in the workplace . coinciding with the new constitution and nasser 's presidency , the rcc dissolved itself and its members resigned their military commissions as part of the transition to civilian rule . during the deliberations surrounding the establishment of a new government , nasser began a process of sidelining his rivals among the original free officers , while elevating his closest allies to high-ranking positions in the cabinet .
in his native poland , in france , where he composed most of his works , and beyond , chopin 's music , his status as one of music 's earliest superstars , his association ( if only indirect ) with political insurrection , his love life and his early death have made him , in the public consciousness , a leading symbol of the romantic era . his works remain popular , and he has been the subject of numerous films and biographies of varying degrees of historical accuracy .
antibacterial-resistant strains and species , sometimes referred to as " superbugs , " now contribute to the emergence of diseases that were for a while well controlled . for example , emergent bacterial strains causing tuberculosis ( tb ) that are resistant to previously effective antibacterial treatments pose many therapeutic challenges . every year , nearly half a million new cases of multidrug-resistant tuberculosis ( mdr-tb ) are estimated to occur worldwide . for example , ndm-1 is a newly identified enzyme conveying bacterial resistance to a broad range of beta-lactam antibacterials . the united kingdom 's health protection agency has stated that " most isolates with ndm-1 enzyme are resistant to all standard intravenous antibiotics for treatment of severe infections . "
the calendar was a refinement to the julian calendar amounting to a 0.002 % correction in the length of the year . the motivation for the reform was to bring the date for the celebration of easter to the time of the year in which it was celebrated when it was introduced by the early church . because the celebration of easter was tied to the spring equinox , the roman catholic church considered the steady drift in the date of easter caused by the year being slightly too long to be undesirable . the reform was adopted initially by the catholic countries of europe . protestants and eastern orthodox countries continued to use the traditional julian calendar and adopted the gregorian reform after a time , for the sake of convenience in international trade . the last european country to adopt the reform was greece , in 1923 .
maternal factors also play a role in the body 's immune response . at birth , most of the immunoglobulin present is maternal igg . because igm , igd , ige and iga don 't cross the placenta , they are almost undetectable at birth . some iga is provided by breast milk . these passively-acquired antibodies can protect the newborn for up to 18 months , but their response is usually short-lived and of low affinity . these antibodies can also produce a negative response . if a child is exposed to the antibody for a particular antigen before being exposed to the antigen itself then the child will produce a dampened response . passively acquired maternal antibodies can suppress the antibody response to active immunization . similarly the response of t-cells to vaccination differs in children compared to adults , and vaccines that induce th1 responses in adults do not readily elicit these same responses in neonates . between six to nine months after birth , a child 's immune system begins to respond more strongly to glycoproteins , but there is usually no marked improvement in their response to polysaccharides until they are at least one year old . this can be the reason for distinct time frames found in vaccination schedules .
it criticised forsyth 's decision to record a conversation with harry as an abuse of teacher-student confidentiality and said " it is clear whichever version of the evidence is accepted that mr burke did ask the claimant to assist prince harry with text for his expressive art project ... it is not part of this tribunal 's function to determine whether or not it was legitimate . " in response to the tribunal 's ruling concerning the allegations about prince harry , the school issued a statement , saying forsyth 's claims " were dismissed for what they always have been - unfounded and irrelevant . " a spokesperson from clarence house said , " we are delighted that harry has been totally cleared of cheating . "
after world war i , when britain and france divided up the middle east 's countries , apart from turkey , between them , pursuant to the sykes-picot agreement - in violation of solemn wartime promises of postwar arab autonomy - there came an immediate reaction : the muslim brotherhood emerged in egypt , the house of saud took over the hijaz , and regimes led by army officers came to power in iran and turkey . " [ b ] oth illiberal currents of the modern middle east , " writes de bellaigne , " islamism and militarism , received a major impetus from western empire-builders . " as often happens in countries undergoing social crisis , the aspirations of the muslim world 's translators and modernizers , such as muhammad abduh , largely had to yield to retrograde currents .
the craft has also been popular in early medieval rus , inherited as part of the byzantine tradition . yaroslav , the grand prince of the kievan rus ' built a large cathedral in his capital , kiev . the model of the church was the hagia sophia in constantinople , and it was also called saint sophia cathedral . it was built mainly by byzantine master craftsmen , sent by constantine monomachos , between 1037 and 1046 . naturally the more important surfaces in the interior were decorated with golden mosaics . in the dome we can see the traditional stern pantokrator supported by angels . between the 12 windows of the drum were apostles and the four evangelists on the pendentives . the apse is dominated by an orant theotokos with a deesis in three medallions above . below is a communion of the apostles .
ye zhiping , the principal of sangzao middle school in sangzao , one of the largest in an county , has been credited with proactive action that spared the lives of all 2,323 pupils in attendance when the earthquake happened . during a three-year period that ended in 2007 , he oversaw a major overhaul of his school . during that time he obtained more than 400,000 yuan ( us $ 60,000 ) from the county education department , money used to widen and strengthen concrete pillars and the balcony railing of all four storeys of his school , as well as secure its concrete floors .
before europeans arrived , the philadelphia area was home to the lenape ( delaware ) indians in the village of shackamaxon . the lenape are a native american tribe and first nations band government . they are also called delaware indians and their historical territory was along the delaware river watershed , western long island and the lower hudson valley . [ a ] most lenape were pushed out of their delaware homeland during the 18th century by expanding european colonies , exacerbated by losses from intertribal conflicts . lenape communities were weakened by newly introduced diseases , mainly smallpox , and violent conflict with europeans . iroquois people occasionally fought the lenape . surviving lenape moved west into the upper ohio river basin . the american revolutionary war and united states ' independence pushed them further west . in the 1860s , the united states government sent most lenape remaining in the eastern united states to the indian territory ( present-day oklahoma and surrounding territory ) under the indian removal policy . in the 21st century , most lenape now reside in the us state of oklahoma , with some communities living also in wisconsin , ontario ( canada ) and in their traditional homelands .
despite their collective name , not all woodwind instruments are made entirely of wood . the reeds used to play them , however , are usually made from arundo donax , a type of monocot cane plant .
the famicom contained no lockout hardware and , as a result , unlicensed cartridges ( both legitimate and bootleg ) were extremely common throughout japan and the far east . the original nes ( but not the top-loading nes-101 ) contained the 10nes lockout chip , which significantly increased the challenges faced by unlicensed developers . tinkerers at home in later years discovered that disassembling the nes and cutting the fourth pin of the lockout chip would change the chip 's mode of operation from " lock " to " key , " removing all effects and greatly improving the console 's ability to play legal games , as well as bootlegs and converted imports . nes consoles sold in different regions had different lockout chips , so games marketed in one region would not work on consoles from another region . known regions are : usa / canada ( 3193 lockout chip ) , most of europe ( 3195 ) , asia ( 3196 ) and uk , italy and australia ( 3197 ) . since two types of lockout chip were used in europe , european nes game boxes often had an " a " or " b " letter on the front , indicating whether the game is compatible with uk / italian / australian consoles ( a ) , or the rest of europe ( b ) . rest-of-europe games typically had text on the box stating " this game is not compatible with the mattel or nes versions of the nintendo entertainment system . " similarly , uk / italy / australia games stated " this game is only compatible with the mattel or nes versions of the nintendo entertainment system . "
the game 's score was composed by toru minegishi and asuka ohta , with series regular koji kondo serving as the sound supervisor . minegishi took charge of composition and sound design in twilight princess , providing all field and dungeon music under the supervision of kondo . for the trailers , three pieces were written by different composers , two of which were created by mahito yokota and kondo . michiru oshima created orchestral arrangements for the three compositions , later to be performed by an ensemble conducted by yasuzo takemoto . kondo 's piece was later chosen as music for the e3 2005 trailer and for the demo movie after the game 's title screen .
pesticides can be classified based upon their biological mechanism function or application method . most pesticides work by poisoning pests . a systemic pesticide moves inside a plant following absorption by the plant . with insecticides and most fungicides , this movement is usually upward ( through the xylem ) and outward . increased efficiency may be a result . systemic insecticides , which poison pollen and nectar in the flowers [ citation needed ] , may kill bees and other needed pollinators [ citation needed ] .
following the ulm campaign , french forces managed to capture vienna in november . the fall of vienna provided the french a huge bounty as they captured 100,000 muskets , 500 cannons , and the intact bridges across the danube . at this critical juncture , both tsar alexander i and holy roman emperor francis ii decided to engage napoleon in battle , despite reservations from some of their subordinates . napoleon sent his army north in pursuit of the allies , but then ordered his forces to retreat so that he could feign a grave weakness . desperate to lure the allies into battle , napoleon gave every indication in the days preceding the engagement that the french army was in a pitiful state , even abandoning the dominant pratzen heights near the village of austerlitz . at the battle of austerlitz , in moravia on 2 december , he deployed the french army below the pratzen heights and deliberately weakened his right flank , enticing the allies to launch a major assault there in the hopes of rolling up the whole french line . a forced march from vienna by marshal davout and his iii corps plugged the gap left by napoleon just in time . meanwhile , the heavy allied deployment against the french right weakened their center on the pratzen heights , which was viciously attacked by the iv corps of marshal soult . with the allied center demolished , the french swept through both enemy flanks and sent the allies fleeing chaotically , capturing thousands of prisoners in the process . the battle is often seen as a tactical masterpiece because of the near-perfect execution of a calibrated but dangerous plan - of the same stature as cannae , the celebrated triumph by hannibal some 2000 years before .

one of the oldest cities in the united states , boston was founded on the shawmut peninsula in 1630 by puritan settlers from england . it was the scene of several key events of the american revolution , such as the boston massacre , the boston tea party , the battle of bunker hill , and the siege of boston . upon american independence from great britain , the city continued to be an important port and manufacturing hub , as well as a center for education and culture . through land reclamation and municipal annexation , boston has expanded beyond the original peninsula . its rich history attracts many tourists , with faneuil hall alone drawing over 20 million visitors per year . boston 's many firsts include the united states ' first public school , boston latin school ( 1635 ) , and first subway system ( 1897 ) .
in an effort to demonstrate peaceful intentions toward germany , on 13 april 1941 , the soviets signed a neutrality pact with axis power japan . while stalin had little faith in japan 's commitment to neutrality , he felt that the pact was important for its political symbolism , to reinforce a public affection for germany . stalin felt that there was a growing split in german circles about whether germany should initiate a war with the soviet union . stalin did not know that hitler had been secretly discussing an invasion of the soviet union since summer 1940 , and that hitler had ordered his military in late 1940 to prepare for war in the east regardless of the parties ' talks of a potential soviet entry as a fourth axis power .
the first game in arena football league history was played on june 19 , 1987 , between the gladiators and commandos at pittsburgh civic arena in front of 12,117 fans . the game was deliberately not televised so that it could be analyzed and any follies and failures would not be subject to national public scrutiny . following the inaugural game , tweaks and adjustments were made , and the first season continued . the dynamite and bruisers played in the first-ever televised afl game the next night , on june 20 , 1987 , at the rosemont horizon in suburban chicago on espn with bob rathbun and lee corso calling the play . the broadcast showed a short clip of the commandos-gladiators game . each team played six games , two against each other team . the top two teams , denver and pittsburgh , then competed in the first-ever afl championship game , arenabowl i .
like other digital music players , ipods can serve as external data storage devices . storage capacity varies by model , ranging from 2 gb for the ipod shuffle to 128 gb for the ipod touch ( previously 160 gb for the ipod classic , which is now discontinued ) .
in december 2009 , then indian navy chief admiral nirmal kumar verma said at his maiden navy week press conference that concepts currently being examined by the directorate of naval design for the second indigenous aircraft carrier ( iac-2 ) , are for a conventionally powered carrier displacing over 50,000 tons and equipped with steam catapults ( rather than the ski-jump on the gorshkov / vikramaditya and the iac ) to launch fourth-generation aircraft . later on in august 2013 vice admiral rk dhowan , while talking about the detailed study underway on the iac-ii project , said that nuclear propulsion was also being considered . the navy also evaluated the electromagnetic aircraft launch system ( emals ) , which is being used by the us navy in their latest gerald r. ford-class aircraft carriers . general atomics , the developer of the emals , was cleared by the us government to give a technical demonstration to indian navy officers , who were impressed by the new capabilities of the system . the emals enables launching varied aircraft including unmanned combat air vehicles ( ucav ) . the aim is to have a total of three aircraft carriers in service , with two fully operational carriers and the third in refit .
soft rock reached its commercial peak in the mid-to-late 1970s with acts such as toto , england dan & john ford coley , air supply , seals and crofts , america and the reformed fleetwood mac , whose rumours ( 1977 ) was the best-selling album of the decade . by 1977 , some radio stations , like new york 's wtfm and nbc-owned wyny , had switched to an all-soft rock format . by the 1980s , tastes had changed and radio formats reflected this change , including musical artists such as journey . walter sabo and his team at nbc brought in major personalities from the am band to the fm band taking the format from a background to a foreground listening experience . the addition of major radio stars such as dan daniel , steve o 'brien , dick summers , don bleu and tom parker made it possible to fully monetize the format and provide the foundation for financial success enjoyed to this day
the ability of birds to navigate during migrations cannot be fully explained by endogenous programming , even with the help of responses to environmental cues . the ability to successfully perform long-distance migrations can probably only be fully explained with an accounting for the cognitive ability of the birds to recognize habitats and form mental maps . satellite tracking of day migrating raptors such as ospreys and honey buzzards has shown that older individuals are better at making corrections for wind drift .
the book aroused international interest and a widespread debate , with no sharp line between scientific issues and ideological , social and religious implications . much of the initial reaction was hostile , but darwin had to be taken seriously as a prominent and respected name in science . there was much less controversy than had greeted the 1844 publication vestiges of creation , which had been rejected by scientists , but had influenced a wide public readership into believing that nature and human society were governed by natural laws . the origin of species as a book of wide general interest became associated with ideas of social reform . its proponents made full use of a surge in the publication of review journals , and it was given more popular attention than almost any other scientific work , though it failed to match the continuing sales of vestiges . darwin 's book legitimised scientific discussion of evolutionary mechanisms , and the newly coined term darwinism was used to cover the whole range of evolutionism , not just his own ideas . by the mid-1870s , evolutionism was triumphant .
computer security , also known as cybersecurity or it security , is the protection of information systems from theft or damage to the hardware , the software , and to the information on them , as well as from disruption or misdirection of the services they provide . it includes controlling physical access to the hardware , as well as protecting against harm that may come via network access , data and code injection , and due to malpractice by operators , whether intentional , accidental , or due to them being tricked into deviating from secure procedures .
the city also boasts an efficient network of public transportation , which mainly consists of bus , taxi and metro systems . the bus network , which is currently run by three companies since 2011 , provides more than 370 routes covering all parts of the city and suburban areas . nanjing metro line 1 , started service on september 3 , 2005 , with 16 stations and a length of 21.72 km . line 2 and the 24.5 km-long south extension of line 1 officially opened to passenger service on may 28 , 2010 . at present , nanjing has a metro system with a grand total of 223.6 kilometers ( 138.9 mi ) of route and 121 stations . they are line 1 , line 2 , line 3 , line 10 , line s1 and line s8 . the city is planning to complete a 17-line metro and light-rail system by 2030 . the expansion of the metro network will greatly facilitate the intracity transportation and reduce the currently heavy traffic congestion .
rapid environmental changes typically cause mass extinctions . more than 99 percent of all species , amounting to over five billion species , that ever lived on earth are estimated to be extinct . estimates on the number of earth 's current species range from 10 million to 14 million , of which about 1.2 million have been documented and over 86 percent have not yet been described . the total amount of related dna base pairs on earth is estimated at 5.0 x 1037 , and weighs 50 billion tonnes . in comparison , the total mass of the biosphere has been estimated to be as much as 4 ttc ( trillion tons of carbon ) .
tajikistan ( i / tɑːˈdʒiːkᵻstɑːn / , / təˈdʒiːkᵻstæn / , or / tæˈdʒiːkiːstæn / ; persian : تاجيكستان тоҷикистон [ tɔd  ʒikɪsˈtɔn ] ) , officially the republic of tajikistan ( persian : جمهورى تاجيكستان tajik : ҷумҳурии тоҷикистон , cumhuriji tocikiston / jumhuriyi tojikiston ; russian : респу  блика таджикистан , respublika tadzhikistan ) , is a mountainous , landlocked country in central asia with an estimated 8 million people in 2013 , and an area of 143,100 km2 ( 55,300 sq mi ) . it is bordered by afghanistan to the south , uzbekistan to the west , kyrgyzstan to the north , and china to the east . pakistan lies to the south , separated by the narrow wakhan corridor . traditional homelands of tajik people included present-day tajikistan , afghanistan and uzbekistan .
though the country 's foreign relations , particularly with western nations , have been strained , relations have thawed since the reforms following the 2010 elections . after years of diplomatic isolation and economic and military sanctions , the united states relaxed curbs on foreign aid to myanmar in november 2011 and announced the resumption of diplomatic relations on 13 january 2012 the european union has placed sanctions on myanmar , including an arms embargo , cessation of trade preferences , and suspension of all aid with the exception of humanitarian aid .
historical population figures are unknown . in 1862 , the population was estimated at about 10,000 . in 1960 , the entire population was about 15,000 . in july 2011 , the number of island residents was estimated to number about 72,191 . over two-thirds of the population live in the capital , majuro and ebeye , the secondary urban center , located in kwajalein atoll . this excludes many who have relocated elsewhere , primarily to the united states . the compact of free association allows them to freely relocate to the united states and obtain work there . a large concentration of about 4,300 marshall islanders have relocated to springdale , arkansas , the largest population concentration of natives outside their island home .
other immune system disorders include various hypersensitivities ( such as in asthma and other allergies ) that respond inappropriately to otherwise harmless compounds .
the study of the quran and the hadith thrived in such a scholarly atmosphere . philosophy , fiqh and theology ( kalaam ) were further developed , most noticeably by avicenna and his opponents . al-razi and al-farabi had provided methodology and knowledge in medicine and philosophy . avicenna had access to the great libraries of balkh , khwarezm , gorgan , rey , isfahan and hamadan . various texts ( such as the ' ahd with bahmanyar ) show that he debated philosophical points with the greatest scholars of the time . aruzi samarqandi describes how before avicenna left khwarezm he had met al-biruni ( a famous scientist and astronomer ) , abu nasr iraqi ( a renowned mathematician ) , abu sahl masihi ( a respected philosopher ) and abu al-khayr khammar ( a great physician ) .
the hortensian law deprived the patricians of their last weapon against the plebeians , and thus resolved the last great political question of the era . no such important political changes occurred between 287 bc and 133 bc . the important laws of this era were still enacted by the senate . in effect , the plebeians were satisfied with the possession of power , but did not care to use it . the senate was supreme during this era because the era was dominated by questions of foreign and military policy . this was the most militarily active era of the roman republic .
all versions of the snes are predominantly gray , although the exact shade may differ . the original north american version , designed by nintendo of america industrial designer lance barr ( who previously redesigned the famicom to become the nes ) , has a boxy design with purple sliding switches and a dark gray eject lever . the loading bay surface is curved , both to invite interaction and to prevent food or drinks from being placed on the console and spilling as had happened with the flat surfaced nes . the japanese and european versions are more rounded , with darker gray accents and buttons . the north american sns-101 model and the japanese super famicom jr . ( the shvc-101 model ) , all designed by barr , are both smaller with a rounded contour ; however , the sns-101 buttons are purple where the super famicom jr. buttons are gray . the european and american versions of the snes controllers have much longer cables compared to the japanese super famicom controllers .
for over 40 years , the fbi crime lab in quantico believed lead in bullets had unique chemical signatures . it analyzed the bullets with the goal of matching them chemically , not only to a single batch of ammunition coming out of a factory , but also to a single box of bullets . the national academy of sciences conducted an 18-month independent review of comparative bullet-lead analysis . in 2003 , its national research council published a report whose conclusions called into question 30 years of fbi testimony . it found the analytic model used by the fbi for interpreting results was deeply flawed , and the conclusion , that bullet fragments could be matched to a box of ammunition , was so overstated that it was misleading under the rules of evidence . one year later , the fbi decided to stop doing bullet lead analysis .
these decisions , apparently taken at the luftflotte or fliegerkorps level ( see organisation of the luftwaffe ( 1933-1945 ) ) , meant attacks on individual targets were gradually replaced by what was , for all intents and purposes , an unrestricted area attack or terrorangriff ( terror attack ) . part of the reason for this was inaccuracy of navigation . the effectiveness of british countermeasures against knickebein , which was designed to avoid area attacks , forced the luftwaffe to resort to these methods . the shift from precision bombing to area attack is indicated in the tactical methods and weapons dropped . kgr 100 increased its use of incendiaries from 13-28 percent . by december , this had increased to 92 percent . use of incendiaries , which were inherently inaccurate , indicated much less care was taken to avoid civilian property close to industrial sites . other units ceased using parachute flares and opted for explosive target markers . captured german air crews also indicated the homes of industrial workers were deliberately targeted .
roughly one-third of the world 's population has been infected with m. tuberculosis , with new infections occurring in about 1 % of the population each year . however , most infections with m. tuberculosis do not cause tb disease , and 90-95 % of infections remain asymptomatic . in 2012 , an estimated 8.6 million chronic cases were active . in 2010 , 8.8 million new cases of tb were diagnosed , and 1.20-1.45 million deaths occurred , most of these occurring in developing countries . of these 1.45 million deaths , about 0.35 million occur in those also infected with hiv .
hunting also has a significant financial impact in the united states , with many companies specialising in hunting equipment or speciality tourism . many different technologies have been created to assist hunters , even including iphone applications . today 's hunters come from a broad range of economic , social , and cultural backgrounds . in 2001 , over thirteen million hunters averaged eighteen days hunting , and spent over $ 20.5 billion on their sport . [ citation needed ] in the us , proceeds from hunting licenses contribute to state game management programs , including preservation of wildlife habitat .
state schools are generally seen as equivalent in quality of education to private-sector institutions . however , the value of a state high-school diploma is limited by the fact that the grades obtained account for only around 25 % of the final grade for each topic , with the remaining 75 % assigned by the teacher during the semester , in a minimally transparent way . cypriot universities ( like universities in greece ) ignore high school grades almost entirely for admissions purposes . while a high-school diploma is mandatory for university attendance , admissions are decided almost exclusively on the basis of scores at centrally administered university entrance examinations that all university candidates are required to take .
the initial assault by north korean kpa forces were aided by the use of soviet t-34-85 tanks . a north korean tank corps equipped with about 120 t-34s spearheaded the invasion . these drove against a rok army with few anti-tank weapons adequate to deal with the soviet t-34s . additional soviet armor was added as the offensive progressed . the north korean tanks had a good deal of early successes against south korean infantry , elements of the 24th infantry division , and those united states built m24 chaffee light tanks that they encountered . interdiction by ground attack aircraft was the only means of slowing the advancing korean armor . the tide turned in favour of the united nations forces in august 1950 when the north koreans suffered major tank losses during a series of battles in which the un forces brought heavier equipment to bear , including m4a3 sherman medium tanks backed by u.s. m26 heavy tanks , along with the british centurion , churchill , and cromwell tanks .
since the opening policy in 1979 , the chinese department stores also develops swiftly along with the fast-growing economy . there are different department store groups dominating different regions . for example , intime department store has the biggest market presence in zhejiang province , while jinying department stores dominate jiangsu province . besides , there are many other department store groups , such as pacific , parkson , wangfujing , new world , etc . , many of them are expanding quickly by listing in the financial market .
at present the alps are one of the more popular tourist destinations in the world with many resorts such oberstdorf , in bavaria , saalbach in austria , davos in switzerland , chamonix in france , and cortina d 'ampezzo in italy recording more than a million annual visitors . with over 120 million visitors a year tourism is integral to the alpine economy with much it coming from winter sports although summer visitors are an important component of the tourism industry .

from july to september 1989 , voyager 2 discovered six moons of neptune . of these , the irregularly shaped proteus is notable for being as large as a body of its density can be without being pulled into a spherical shape by its own gravity . although the second-most-massive neptunian moon , it is only 0.25 % the mass of triton . neptune 's innermost four moons - naiad , thalassa , despina and galatea - orbit close enough to be within neptune 's rings . the next-farthest out , larissa , was originally discovered in 1981 when it had occulted a star . this occultation had been attributed to ring arcs , but when voyager 2 observed neptune in 1989 , larissa was found to have caused it . five new irregular moons discovered between 2002 and 2003 were announced in 2004 . a new moon and the smallest yet , s / 2004 n 1 , was found in 2013 . because neptune was the roman god of the sea , neptune 's moons have been named after lesser sea gods .
during periods of unemployment , there has been a long pattern of emigration from the island since the post-napoleonic period . the majority of " saints " emigrated to the uk , south africa and in the early years , australia . the population has steadily declined since the late 1980s and has dropped from 5,157 at the 1998 census to 4,255 in 2008 . in the past emigration was characterised by young unaccompanied persons leaving to work on long-term contracts on ascension and the falkland islands , but since " saints " were re-awarded uk citizenship in 2002 , emigration to the uk by a wider range of wage-earners has accelerated due to the prospect of higher wages and better progression prospects .
about 40,000,000 tons were produced in 1984 [ needs update ] . it is obtained as the " heavy " ( i.e. , difficult to distill ) fraction . material with a boiling point greater than around 500 ° c is considered asphalt . vacuum distillation separates it from the other components in crude oil ( such as naphtha , gasoline and diesel ) . the resulting material is typically further treated to extract small but valuable amounts of lubricants and to adjust the properties of the material to suit applications . in a de-asphalting unit , the crude asphalt is treated with either propane or butane in a supercritical phase to extract the lighter molecules , which are then separated . further processing is possible by " blowing " the product : namely reacting it with oxygen . this step makes the product harder and more viscous .
during the napoleonic wars he was taken seriously by the british press as a dangerous tyrant , poised to invade . he was often referred to by the british as boney . a nursery rhyme warned children that bonaparte ravenously ate naughty people ; the " bogeyman . " the british tory press sometimes depicted napoleon as much smaller than average height , and this image persists . confusion about his height also results from the difference between the french pouce and british inch - 2.71 cm and 2.54 cm , respectively . the myth of the " napoleon complex " - named after him to describe men who have an inferiority complex - stems primarily from the fact that he was listed , incorrectly , as 5 feet 2 inches ( in french units ) at the time of his death . in fact , he was 1.68 metres ( 5 ft 6 in ) tall , an average height for a man in that period . [ note 11 ]
providing 25 % of namibia 's revenue , mining is the single most important contributor to the economy . namibia is the fourth largest exporter of non-fuel minerals in africa and the world 's fourth largest producer of uranium . there has been significant investment in uranium mining and namibia is set to become the largest exporter of uranium by 2015 . rich alluvial diamond deposits make namibia a primary source for gem-quality diamonds . while namibia is known predominantly for its gem diamond and uranium deposits , a number of other minerals are extracted industrially such as lead , tungsten , gold , tin , fluorspar , manganese , marble , copper and zinc . there are offshore gas deposits in the atlantic ocean that are planned to be extracted in the future . according to " the diamond investigation , " a book about the global diamond market , from 1978 , de beers , the largest diamond company , bought most of the namibian diamonds , and would continue to do so , because " whatever government eventually comes to power they will need this revenue to survive . "
a monument to the huge human cost of some of the gigantic construction projects of the early ming dynasty is the yangshan quarry ( located some 15-20 km ( 9-12 mi ) east of the walled city and ming xiaoling mausoleum ) , where a gigantic stele , cut on the orders of the yongle emperor , lies abandoned , just as it was left 600 years ago when it was understood it was impossible to move or complete it .
by the late middle ages , great britain was separated into the kingdoms of england and scotland . power in ireland fluxed between gaelic kingdoms , hiberno-norman lords and the english-dominated lordship of ireland . a similar situation existed in the principality of wales , which was slowly being annexed into the kingdom of england by a series of laws . during the course of the 15th century , the crown of england would assert a claim to the crown of france , thereby also releasing the king of england as from being vassal of the king of france . in 1534 , king henry viii , at first having been a strong defender of roman catholicism in the face of the reformation , separated from the roman church after failing to secure a divorce from the pope . his response was to place the king of england as " the only supreme head in earth of the church of england , " thereby removing the authority of the pope from the affairs of the english church . ireland , which had been held by the king of england as lord of ireland , but which strictly speaking had been a feudal possession of the pope since the norman invasion was declared a separate kingdom in personal union with england .
flower ontogeny uses a combination of genes normally responsible for forming new shoots . the most primitive flowers probably had a variable number of flower parts , often separate from ( but in contact with ) each other . the flowers tended to grow in a spiral pattern , to be bisexual ( in plants , this means both male and female parts on the same flower ) , and to be dominated by the ovary ( female part ) . as flowers evolved , some variations developed parts fused together , with a much more specific number and design , and with either specific sexes per flower or plant or at least " ovary-inferior . "
the most excellent order of the british empire is the " order of chivalry of british constitutional monarchy , " rewarding contributions to the arts and sciences , work with charitable and welfare organisations and public service outside the civil service . it was established on 4 june 1917 by king george v , and comprises five classes , in civil and military divisions , the most senior two of which make the recipient either a knight if male , or dame if female . there is also the related british empire medal , whose recipients are affiliated with , but not members of , the order .
from the american civil war until the mid-20th century , philadelphia was a bastion of the republican party , which arose from the staunch pro-northern views of philadelphia residents during and after the war ( philadelphia was chosen as the host city for the first republican national convention in 1856 ) . after the great depression , democratic registrations increased , but the city was not carried by democrat franklin d. roosevelt in his landslide victory of 1932 ( in which pennsylvania was one of the few states won by republican herbert hoover ) . four years later , however , voter turnout surged and the city finally flipped to the democrats . roosevelt carried philadelphia with over 60 % of the vote in 1936 . the city has remained loyally democratic in every presidential election since . it is now one of the most democratic in the country ; in 2008 , democrat barack obama drew 83 % of the city 's vote . obama 's win was even greater in 2012 , capturing 85 % of the vote .
england is quite a successful nation at the uefa european football championship , having finished in third place in 1968 and reached the semi-final in 1996 . england hosted euro 96 and have appeared in eight uefa european championship finals tournaments , tied for ninth-best . the team has also reached the quarter-final on two recent occasions in 2004 and 2012 . the team 's worst result in the competition was a first-round elimination in 1980 , 1988 , 1992 and 2000 . the team did not enter in 1960 , and they failed to qualify in 1964 , 1972 , 1976 , 1984 , and 2008 .
in apollo 's role as a healer , his appellations included acesius ( / əˈsiːʒəs / ə-see-zhəs ; ακεσιος , akesios , from ακεσις , " healing " ) , acestor ( / əˈsɛstər / ə-ses-tər ; ακεστωρ , akestor , literally " healer " ) , paean ( / ˈpiːən / pee-ən ; παιαν , paian , from παιειν , " to touch " ) , [ citation needed ] and iatrus ( / aɪˈætrəs / eye-at-rəs ; ιατρος , iatros , literally " physician " ) . acesius was the epithet of apollo worshipped in elis , where he had a temple in the agora . the romans referred to apollo as medicus ( / ˈmɛdᵻkəs / med-i-kəs ; literally " physician " in latin ) in this respect . a temple was dedicated to apollo medicus at rome , probably next to the temple of bellona .
facial hair in males normally appears in a specific order during puberty : the first facial hair to appear tends to grow at the corners of the upper lip , typically between 14 to 17 years of age . it then spreads to form a moustache over the entire upper lip . this is followed by the appearance of hair on the upper part of the cheeks , and the area under the lower lip . the hair eventually spreads to the sides and lower border of the chin , and the rest of the lower face to form a full beard . as with most human biological processes , this specific order may vary among some individuals . facial hair is often present in late adolescence , around ages 17 and 18 , but may not appear until significantly later . some men do not develop full facial hair for 10 years after puberty . facial hair continues to get coarser , darker and thicker for another 2-4 years after puberty .
the term " gothic architecture " originated as a pejorative description . giorgio vasari used the term " barbarous german style " in his lives of the artists to describe what is now considered the gothic style , and in the introduction to the lives he attributes various architectural features to " the goths " whom he holds responsible for destroying the ancient buildings after they conquered rome , and erecting new ones in this style . at the time in which vasari was writing , italy had experienced a century of building in the classical architectural vocabulary revived in the renaissance and seen as evidence of a new golden age of learning and refinement .
in 1974 , l. ottens , director of the audio division of philips , started a small group with the aim to develop an analog optical audio disc with a diameter of 20 cm and a sound quality superior to that of the vinyl record . however , due to the unsatisfactory performance of the analog format , two philips research engineers recommended a digital format in march 1974 . in 1977 , philips then established a laboratory with the mission of creating a digital audio disc . the diameter of philips 's prototype compact disc was set at 11.5 cm , the diagonal of an audio cassette .
in 1983 , the international telecommunication union 's radio telecommunications sector ( itu-r ) set up a working party ( iwp11 / 6 ) with the aim of setting a single international hdtv standard . one of the thornier issues concerned a suitable frame / field refresh rate , the world already having split into two camps , 25 / 50 hz and 30 / 60 hz , largely due to the differences in mains frequency . the iwp11 / 6 working party considered many views and throughout the 1980s served to encourage development in a number of video digital processing areas , not least conversion between the two main frame / field rates using motion vectors , which led to further developments in other areas . while a comprehensive hdtv standard was not in the end established , agreement on the aspect ratio was achieved .
greek drama exemplifies the earliest form of drama of which we have substantial knowledge . tragedy , as a dramatic genre , developed as a performance associated with religious and civic festivals , typically enacting or developing upon well-known historical or mythological themes . tragedies generally presented very serious themes . with the advent of newer technologies , scripts written for non-stage media have been added to this form . war of the worlds ( radio ) in 1938 saw the advent of literature written for radio broadcast , and many works of drama have been adapted for film or television . conversely , television , film , and radio literature have been adapted to printed or electronic media .

burke put forward that " we fear god , we look up with awe to kings ; with affection to parliaments ; with duty to magistrates ; with reverence to priests ; and with respect to nobility . why ? because when such ideas are brought before our minds , it is natural to be so affected . " burke defended this prejudice on the grounds that it is " the general bank and capital of nations , and of ages " and superior to individual reason , which is small in comparison . " prejudice , " burke claimed , " is of ready application in the emergency ; it previously engages the mind in a steady course of wisdom and virtue , and does not leave the man hesitating in the moment of decision , skeptical , puzzled , and unresolved . prejudice renders a man 's virtue his habit . " burke criticised social contract theory by claiming that society is indeed , a contract , but " a partnership not only between those who are living , but between those who are living , those who are dead , and those who are to be born . "

brain areas involved in the neuroanatomy of memory such as the hippocampus , the amygdala , the striatum , or the mammillary bodies are thought to be involved in specific types of memory . for example , the hippocampus is believed to be involved in spatial learning and declarative learning , while the amygdala is thought to be involved in emotional memory . damage to certain areas in patients and animal models and subsequent memory deficits is a primary source of information . however , rather than implicating a specific area , it could be that damage to adjacent areas , or to a pathway traveling through the area is actually responsible for the observed deficit . further , it is not sufficient to describe memory , and its counterpart , learning , as solely dependent on specific brain regions . learning and memory are attributed to changes in neuronal synapses , thought to be mediated by long-term potentiation and long-term depression .

on march 26 , 1913 , venustiano carranza issued the plan de guadalupe , which refused to recognize huerta as president and called for war between the two factions . soon after the assassination of president madero , carranza returned to mexico to fight huerta , but with only a handful of comrades . however , by 1913 his forces had swelled into an army of thousands , called the division del norte ( northern division ) . villa and his army , along with emiliano zapata and alvaro obregon , united with carranza to fight against huerta . in march 1914 carranza traveled to ciudad juarez , which served as rebellion 's capital for the remainder of the struggle with huerta . in april 1914 u.s. opposition to huerta had reached its peak , blockading the regime 's ability to resupply from abroad . carranza trying to keep his nationalistic credentials threatened war with the united states . in his spontaneous response to u.s. president woodrow wilson carranza asked " that the president withdraw american troops from mexico . "
the state ( like its southwestern neighbors ) has had close linguistic and cultural ties with mexico . the state outside the gadsden purchase of 1853 was part of the new mexico territory until 1863 , when the western half was made into the arizona territory . the area of the former gadsden purchase contained a majority of spanish-speakers until the 1940s , although the tucson area had a higher ratio of anglophones ( including mexican americans who were fluent in english ) ; the continuous arrival of mexican settlers increases the number of spanish-speakers .
alpine plants such the alpine gentian grow in abundance in areas such as the meadows above the lauterbrunnental . gentians are named after the illyrian king gentius , and 40 species of the early-spring blooming flower grow in the alps , in a range of 1,500 to 2,400 m ( 4,921 to 7,874 ft ) . writing about the gentians in switzerland d. h. lawrence described them as " darkening the day-time , torch-like with the smoking blueness of pluto 's gloom . " gentians tend to " appear " repeatedly as the spring blooming takes place at progressively later dates , moving from the lower altitude to the higher altitude meadows where the snow melts much later than in the valleys . on the highest rocky ledges the spring flowers bloom in the summer .
in 77 bc , the senate sent one of sulla 's former lieutenants , gnaeus pompeius magnus ( " pompey the great " ) , to put down an uprising in spain . by 71 bc , pompey returned to rome after having completed his mission . around the same time , another of sulla 's former lieutenants , marcus licinius crassus , had just put down the spartacus-led gladiator / slave revolt in italy . upon their return , pompey and crassus found the populares party fiercely attacking sulla 's constitution . they attempted to forge an agreement with the populares party . if both pompey and crassus were elected consul in 70 bc , they would dismantle the more obnoxious components of sulla 's constitution . the two were soon elected , and quickly dismantled most of sulla 's constitution .
in the 1950s , as a young woman at the start of her reign , elizabeth was depicted as a glamorous " fairytale queen . " after the trauma of the second world war , it was a time of hope , a period of progress and achievement heralding a " new elizabethan age . " lord altrincham 's accusation in 1957 that her speeches sounded like those of a " priggish schoolgirl " was an extremely rare criticism . in the late 1960s , attempts to portray a more modern image of the monarchy were made in the television documentary royal family and by televising prince charles 's investiture as prince of wales . in public , she took to wearing mostly solid-colour overcoats and decorative hats , which allow her to be seen easily in a crowd .
the original model famicom featured two game controllers , both of which were hardwired to the back of the console . the second controller lacked the start and select buttons , but featured a small microphone . relatively few games made use of this feature . the earliest produced famicom units initially had square a and b buttons . this was changed to the circular designs because of the square buttons being caught in the controller casing when pressed down and glitches within the hardware causing the system to freeze occasionally while playing a game .
adjacent to the palace is the royal mews , also designed by nash , where the royal carriages , including the gold state coach , are housed . this rococo gilt coach , designed by sir william chambers in 1760 , has painted panels by g. b. cipriani . it was first used for the state opening of parliament by george iii in 1762 and has been used by the monarch for every coronation since george iv . it was last used for the golden jubilee of elizabeth ii . also housed in the mews are the coach horses used at royal ceremonial processions .
under the leadership of vladimir lenin , the bolsheviks established the soviet state on 7 november [ o.s. 25 october ] 1917 , immediately after the russian provisional government , which governed the russian republic , was overthrown during the october revolution . initially , the state did not have an official name and wasn 't recognized by neighboring countries for five months . meanwhile , anti-bolsheviks coined the mocking label " sovdepia " for the nascent state of the " soviets of workers ' and peasants ' deputies . "
the first settlers primarily came from england , its caribbean colony of barbados , and its atlantic colony of bermuda . among these were free people of color , born in the west indies of alliances and marriages between africans and englanders , when color lines were looser among the working class in the early colonial years , and some wealthy whites took black consorts or concubines . charles town attracted a mixture of ethnic and religious groups . french , scottish , irish , and germans migrated to the developing seacoast town , representing numerous protestant denominations . because of the battles between english " royalty " and the roman catholic church , practicing catholics were not allowed to settle in south carolina until after the american revolution . jews were allowed , and sephardic jews migrated to the city in such numbers that by the beginning of the 19th century , the city was home to the largest and wealthiest jewish community in north america - a status it held until about 1830 .
it was during this decade that vocal house became firmly established , both in the underground and as part of the pop market , and labels such as defected records , roule and om were at the forefront of championing the emerging sound . in the mid-2000s , fusion genres such as electro house and fidget house emerged . [ citation needed ] this fusion is apparent in the crossover of musical styles by artists such as dennis ferrer and booka shade , with the former 's production style having evolved from the new york soulful house scene and the latter 's roots in techno .
a staple for consumers in the city is the omnipresent " mercado . " every major neighborhood in the city has its own borough-regulated market , often more than one . these are large well-established facilities offering most basic products , such as fresh produce and meat / poultry , dry goods , tortillerias , and many other services such as locksmiths , herbal medicine , hardware goods , sewing implements ; and a multitude of stands offering freshly made , home-style cooking and drinks in the tradition of aguas frescas and atole .
sea levels began to rise during the jurassic , which was probably caused by an increase in seafloor spreading . the formation of new crust beneath the surface displaced ocean waters by as much as 200 m ( 656 ft ) more than today , which flooded coastal areas . furthermore , pangaea began to rift into smaller divisions , bringing more land area in contact with the ocean by forming the tethys sea . temperatures continued to increase and began to stabilize . humidity also increased with the proximity of water , and deserts retreated .
two days after " 1984 " aired , the macintosh went on sale , and came bundled with two applications designed to show off its interface : macwrite and macpaint . it was first demonstrated by steve jobs in the first of his famous mac keynote speeches , and though the mac garnered an immediate , enthusiastic following , some labeled it a mere " toy . " because the operating system was designed largely around the gui , existing text-mode and command-driven applications had to be redesigned and the programming code rewritten . this was a time-consuming task that many software developers chose not to undertake , and could be regarded as a reason for an initial lack of software for the new system . in april 1984 , microsoft 's multiplan migrated over from ms-dos , with microsoft word following in january 1985 . in 1985 , lotus software introduced lotus jazz for the macintosh platform after the success of lotus 1-2-3 for the ibm pc , although it was largely a flop . apple introduced the macintosh office suite the same year with the " lemmings " ad . infamous for insulting its own potential customers , the ad was not successful .
philadelphia gas works ( pgw ) , overseen by the pennsylvania public utility commission , is the nation 's largest municipally owned natural gas utility . it serves over 500,000 homes and businesses in the philadelphia area . founded in 1836 , the company came under city ownership in 1987 and has been providing the majority of gas distributed within city limits . in 2014 , the philadelphia city council refused to conduct hearings on a $ 1.86 billion sale of pgw , part of a two-year effort that was proposed by the mayor . the refusal led to the prospective buyer terminating its offer .
while most artists became established in other formats before moving to adult contemporary , michael buble and josh groban started out as ac artists . throughout this decade , artists such as nick lachey , james blunt , john mayer , bruno mars , jason mraz , kelly clarkson , adele , clay aiken and susan boyle have become successful thanks to a ballad heavy sound . much as some hot ac and modern rock artists have crossed over into each other , so too has soft ac crossed with country music in this decade . country musicians such as faith hill , shania twain , leann rimes and carrie underwood have had success on both charts .
the city grew as the population did , coming up against the lake 's waters . as the depth of the lake water fluctuated , mexico city was subject to periodic flooding . a major labor draft , the desague , compelled thousands of indians over the colonial period to work on infrastructure to prevent flooding . floods were not only an inconvenience but also a health hazard , since during flood periods human waste polluted the city 's streets . by draining the area , the mosquito population dropped as did the frequency of the diseases they spread . however , draining the wetlands also changed the habitat for fish and birds and the areas accessible for indian cultivation close to the capital .
german record company odeon is often said to have pioneered the album in 1909 when it released the nutcracker suite by tchaikovsky on 4 double-sided discs in a specially designed package . ( it is not indicated what size the records are . ) however , deutsche grammophon had produced an album for its complete recording of the opera carmen in the previous year . the practice of issuing albums does not seem to have been widely taken up by other record companies for many years ; however , hmv provided an album , with a pictorial cover , for the 1917 recording of the mikado ( gilbert & sullivan ) .
over the years a variety of record equalization practices emerged and there was no industry standard . for example , in europe recordings for years required playback with a bass turnover setting of 250-300 hz and a treble roll-off at 10,000 hz ranging from 0 to − 5 db or more . in the us there were more varied practices and a tendency to use higher bass turnover frequencies such as 500 hz as well as a greater treble rolloff like − 8.5 db and even more to record generally higher modulation levels on the record .
uranium is more plentiful than antimony , tin , cadmium , mercury , or silver , and it is about as abundant as arsenic or molybdenum . uranium is found in hundreds of minerals , including uraninite ( the most common uranium ore ) , carnotite , autunite , uranophane , torbernite , and coffinite . significant concentrations of uranium occur in some substances such as phosphate rock deposits , and minerals such as lignite , and monazite sands in uranium-rich ores ( it is recovered commercially from sources with as little as 0.1 % uranium ) .
however , mathews ' frustration with whitehead 's books did not negatively affect his interest . in fact , there were numerous philosophers and theologians at chicago 's divinity school that perceived the importance of what whitehead was doing without fully grasping all of the details and implications . in 1927 they invited one of america 's only whitehead experts - henry nelson wieman - to chicago to give a lecture explaining whitehead 's thought . wieman 's lecture was so brilliant that he was promptly hired to the faculty and taught there for twenty years , and for at least thirty years afterward chicago 's divinity school was closely associated with whitehead 's thought .
it was principally the widespread introduction of a single feature , the pointed arch , which was to bring about the change that separates gothic from romanesque . the technological change permitted a stylistic change which broke the tradition of massive masonry and solid walls penetrated by small openings , replacing it with a style where light appears to triumph over substance . with its use came the development of many other architectural devices , previously put to the test in scattered buildings and then called into service to meet the structural , aesthetic and ideological needs of the new style . these include the flying buttresses , pinnacles and traceried windows which typify gothic ecclesiastical architecture . but while pointed arch is so strongly associated with the gothic style , it was first used in western architecture in buildings that were in other ways clearly romanesque , notably durham cathedral in the north of england , monreale cathedral and cathedral of cefalu in sicily , autun cathedral in france .
bermuda was colonised by the english as an extension of virginia and has long had close ties with the us atlantic seaboard and canadian maritimes as well as the uk . it had a history of african slavery , although britain abolished it decades before the us . since the 20th century , there has been considerable immigration to bermuda from the west indies , as well as continued immigration from portuguese atlantic islands . unlike immigrants from british colonies in the west indies , the latter immigrants have had greater difficulty in becoming permanent residents as they lacked british citizenship , mostly spoke no english , and required renewal of work permits to remain beyond an initial period . from the 1950s onwards , bermuda relaxed its immigration laws , allowing increased immigration from britain and canada . some black politicians accused the government of using this device to counter the west indian immigration of previous decades .
the maximum distance at which a gun or missile can engage an aircraft is an important figure . however , many different definitions are used but unless the same definition is used , performance of different guns or missiles cannot be compared . for aa guns only the ascending part of the trajectory can be usefully used . one term is ' ceiling ' , maximum ceiling being the height a projectile would reach if fired vertically , not practically useful in itself as few aa guns are able to fire vertically , and maximum fuse duration may be too short , but potentially useful as a standard to compare different weapons .
jehovah 's witnesses are perhaps best known for their efforts to spread their beliefs , most notably by visiting people from house to house , distributing literature published by the watch tower society in 700 languages . the objective is to start a regular " bible study " with any person who is not already a member , with the intention that the student be baptized as a member of the group ; witnesses are advised to consider discontinuing bible studies with students who show no interest in becoming members . witnesses are taught they are under a biblical command to engage in public preaching . they are instructed to devote as much time as possible to their ministry and are required to submit an individual monthly " field service report . " baptized members who fail to report a month of preaching are termed " irregular " and may be counseled by elders ; those who do not submit reports for six consecutive months are termed " inactive . "
for ruskin , the aesthetic was of overriding significance . his work goes on to state that a building is not truly a work of architecture unless it is in some way " adorned . " for ruskin , a well-constructed , well-proportioned , functional building needed string courses or rustication , at the very least .
on 22 july 2010 , the british government agreed to help pay for the new airport using taxpayer money . in november 2011 a new deal between the british government and south african civil engineering company basil read was signed and the airport was scheduled to open in february 2016 , with flights to and from south africa and the uk . in march 2015 south african airline comair became the preferred bidder to provide weekly air service between the island and johannesburg , starting from 2016 .
roman calendars show roughly forty annual religious festivals . some lasted several days , others a single day or less : sacred days ( dies fasti ) outnumbered " non-sacred " days ( dies nefasti ) . a comparison of surviving roman religious calendars suggests that official festivals were organized according to broad seasonal groups that allowed for different local traditions . some of the most ancient and popular festivals incorporated ludi ( " games , " such as chariot races and theatrical performances ) , with examples including those held at palestrina in honour of fortuna primigenia during compitalia , and the ludi romani in honour of liber . other festivals may have required only the presence and rites of their priests and acolytes , or particular groups , such as women at the bona dea rites .
into the first half of the twentieth century after the establishment of roc , nanjing gradually shifted from being a production hub towards being a heavy consumption city , mainly because of the rapid expansion of its wealthy population after nanjing once again regained the political spotlight of china . a number of huge department stores such as zhongyang shangchang sprouted up , attracting merchants from all over china to sell their products in nanjing . in 1933 , the revenue generated by the food and entertainment industry in the city exceeded the sum of the output of the manufacturing and agriculture industry . one third of the city population worked in the service industry , .

in 1903 , after british victory in the anglo-boer war , swaziland became a british protectorate . much of its early administration ( for example , postal services ) being carried out from south africa until 1906 when the transvaal colony was granted self-government . following this , swaziland was partitioned into european and non-european ( or native reserves ) areas with the former being two-thirds of the total land . sobhuza 's official coronation was in december 1921 after the regency of labotsibeni after which he led an unsuccessful deputation to the privy council in london in 1922 regarding the issue of the land .
the hellenistic period covers the period of ancient greek ( hellenic ) history and mediterranean history between the death of alexander the great in 323 bc and the emergence of the roman empire as signified by the battle of actium in 31 bc and the subsequent conquest of ptolemaic egypt the following year . at this time , greek cultural influence and power was at its peak in europe , africa and asia , experiencing prosperity and progress in the arts , exploration , literature , theatre , architecture , music , mathematics , philosophy , and science . for example , competitive public games took place , ideas in biology , and popular entertainment in theaters . it is often considered a period of transition , sometimes even of decadence or degeneration , compared to the enlightenment of the greek classical era . the hellenistic period saw the rise of new comedy , alexandrian poetry , the septuagint and the philosophies of stoicism and epicureanism . greek science was advanced by the works of the mathematician euclid and the polymath archimedes . the religious sphere expanded to include new gods such as the greco-egyptian serapis , eastern deities such as attis and cybele and the greek adoption of buddhism .
a professional wrestling match can end in a draw . a draw occurs if both opponents are simultaneously disqualified ( as via countout or if the referee loses complete control of the match and both opponents attack each other with no regard to being in a match , like brock lesnar vs. undertaker at unforgiven in 2002 ) , neither opponent is able to answer a ten-count , or both opponents simultaneously win the match . the latter can occur if , for example , one opponent 's shoulders touch the mat while maintaining a submission hold against another opponent . if the opponent in the hold begins to tap out at the same time a referee counts to three for pinning the opponent delivering the hold , both opponents have legally achieved scoring conditions simultaneously . traditionally , a championship may not change hands in the event of a draw ( though it may become vacant ) , though some promotions such as tna have endorsed rules where the champion may lose a title by disqualification . a variant of the draw is the time-limit draw , where the match does not have a winner by a specified time period ( a one-hour draw , which was once common , is known in wrestling circles as a " broadway " ) .
french political scientist maurice duverger drew a distinction between cadre parties and mass parties . cadre parties were political elites that were concerned with contesting elections and restricted the influence of outsiders , who were only required to assist in election campaigns . mass parties tried to recruit new members who were a source of party income and were often expected to spread party ideology as well as assist in elections.socialist parties are examples of mass parties , while the british conservative party and the german christian democratic union are examples of hybrid parties . in the united states , where both major parties were cadre parties , the introduction of primaries and other reforms has transformed them so that power is held by activists who compete over influence and nomination of candidates .
in his book , the greatest show on earth : the evidence for evolution , biologist richard dawkins grapples with the question of why pain has to be so very painful . he describes the alternative as a simple , mental raising of a " red flag . " to argue why that red flag might be insufficient , dawkins explains that drives must compete with each other within living beings . the most fit creature would be the one whose pains are well balanced . those pains which mean certain death when ignored will become the most powerfully felt . the relative intensities of pain , then , may resemble the relative importance of that risk to our ancestors ( lack of food , too much cold , or serious injuries are felt as agony , whereas minor damage is felt as mere discomfort ) . this resemblance will not be perfect , however , because natural selection can be a poor designer . the result is often glitches in animals , including supernormal stimuli . such glitches help explain pains which are not , or at least no longer directly adaptive ( e.g. perhaps some forms of toothache , or injury to fingernails ) .
the persian gulf war was a conflict between iraq and a coalition force of 34 nations led by the united states . the lead up to the war began with the iraqi invasion of kuwait in august 1990 which was met with immediate economic sanctions by the united nations against iraq . the coalition commenced hostilities in january 1991 , resulting in a decisive victory for the u.s. led coalition forces , which drove iraqi forces out of kuwait with minimal coalition deaths . despite the low death toll , over 180,000 us veterans would later be classified as " permanently disabled " according to the us department of veterans affairs ( see gulf war syndrome ) . the main battles were aerial and ground combat within iraq , kuwait and bordering areas of saudi arabia . land combat did not expand outside of the immediate iraq / kuwait / saudi border region , although the coalition bombed cities and strategic targets across iraq , and iraq fired missiles on israeli and saudi cities .
other popular names for the format include " warm , " " sunny , " " bee " ( or " b " ) and ( particularly in canada ) " ez rock . " the format can be seen as a more contemporary successor to and combination of the middle of the road ( mor ) , beautiful music , easy listening and soft rock formats . many stations in the soft ac format capitalize on its appeal to office workers ( many of them females aged 25-54 , a key advertiser demographic ) , and brand themselves as stations " everyone at work can agree on " ( kost originated that phrase as a primary tagline , and other soft ac stations have followed suit ) .

two days after the marriage , bonaparte left paris to take command of the army of italy . he immediately went on the offensive , hoping to defeat the forces of piedmont before their austrian allies could intervene . in a series of rapid victories during the montenotte campaign , he knocked piedmont out of the war in two weeks . the french then focused on the austrians for the remainder of the war , the highlight of which became the protracted struggle for mantua . the austrians launched a series of offensives against the french to break the siege , but napoleon defeated every relief effort , scoring notable victories at the battles of castiglione , bassano , arcole , and rivoli . the decisive french triumph at rivoli in january 1797 led to the collapse of the austrian position in italy . at rivoli , the austrians lost up to 14,000 men while the french lost about 5,000 .
the cult centers of apollo in greece , delphi and delos , date from the 8th century bce . the delos sanctuary was primarily dedicated to artemis , apollo 's twin sister . at delphi , apollo was venerated as the slayer of pytho . for the greeks , apollo was all the gods in one and through the centuries he acquired different functions which could originate from different gods . in archaic greece he was the prophet , the oracular god who in older times was connected with " healing . " in classical greece he was the god of light and of music , but in popular religion he had a strong function to keep away evil . walter burkert discerned three components in the prehistory of apollo worship , which he termed " a dorian-northwest greek component , a cretan-minoan component , and a syro-hittite component . "

in 1994 , cinematographic production received a boost with the establishment of the cinema advisory committee . as of the year 2000 , the annual amount set aside in the national budget stands at cy pounds 500,000 ( about 850,000 euros ) . in addition to government grants , cypriot co-productions are eligible for funding from the council of europe 's eurimages fund , which finances european film co-productions . to date , four feature-length films in which a cypriot was executive producer have received funding from eurimages . the first was i sphagi tou kokora ( 1992 ) , completed in 1996 , hellados ( and the trains fly to the sky , 1995 ) , which is currently in post-production , and costas demetriou 's o dromos gia tin ithaki ( the road to ithaka , 1997 ) which premiered in march 2000 . the theme song to the road to ithaka was composed by costas cacoyannis and sung by alexia vassiliou . in september 1999 , to tama ( the promise ) by andreas pantzis also received funding from the eurimages fund . in 2009 the greek director , writer and producer vassilis mazomenos filmed in cyprus guilt . the film was awarded in 2012 with the best screenwriting and best photography award in london greek film festival ( uk ) and was official selection in montreal world film festival , cairo international film festival , india international film festival , tallinn black nights film festival , fantasporto and opening film in the panorama of european cinema in athens . in 2010 the film was nominated for the best film from the hellenic film academy .
the caribbean initially provided england 's most important and lucrative colonies , but not before several attempts at colonisation failed . an attempt to establish a colony in guiana in 1604 lasted only two years , and failed in its main objective to find gold deposits . colonies in st lucia ( 1605 ) and grenada ( 1609 ) also rapidly folded , but settlements were successfully established in st. kitts ( 1624 ) , barbados ( 1627 ) and nevis ( 1628 ) . the colonies soon adopted the system of sugar plantations successfully used by the portuguese in brazil , which depended on slave labour , and - at first - dutch ships , to sell the slaves and buy the sugar . to ensure that the increasingly healthy profits of this trade remained in english hands , parliament decreed in 1651 that only english ships would be able to ply their trade in english colonies . this led to hostilities with the united dutch provinces - a series of anglo-dutch wars - which would eventually strengthen england 's position in the americas at the expense of the dutch . in 1655 , england annexed the island of jamaica from the spanish , and in 1666 succeeded in colonising the bahamas .
commercially cultivated grapes can usually be classified as either table or wine grapes , based on their intended method of consumption : eaten raw ( table grapes ) or used to make wine ( wine grapes ) . while almost all of them belong to the same species , vitis vinifera , table and wine grapes have significant differences , brought about through selective breeding . table grape cultivars tend to have large , seedless fruit ( see below ) with relatively thin skin . wine grapes are smaller , usually seeded , and have relatively thick skins ( a desirable characteristic in winemaking , since much of the aroma in wine comes from the skin ) . wine grapes also tend to be very sweet : they are harvested at the time when their juice is approximately 24 % sugar by weight . by comparison , commercially produced " 100 % grape juice , " made from table grapes , is usually around 15 % sugar by weight .
neptune 's more varied weather when compared to uranus is due in part to its higher internal heating . although neptune lies over 50 % further from the sun than uranus , and receives only 40 % its amount of sunlight , the two planets ' surface temperatures are roughly equal . the upper regions of neptune 's troposphere reach a low temperature of 51.8 k ( − 221.3 ° c ) . at a depth where the atmospheric pressure equals 1 bar ( 100 kpa ) , the temperature is 72.00 k ( − 201.15 ° c ) . deeper inside the layers of gas , the temperature rises steadily . as with uranus , the source of this heating is unknown , but the discrepancy is larger : uranus only radiates 1.1 times as much energy as it receives from the sun ; whereas neptune radiates about 2.61 times as much energy as it receives from the sun . neptune is the farthest planet from the sun , yet its internal energy is sufficient to drive the fastest planetary winds seen in the solar system . depending on the thermal properties of its interior , the heat left over from neptune 's formation may be sufficient to explain its current heat flow , though it is more difficult to simultaneously explain uranus 's lack of internal heat while preserving the apparent similarity between the two planets .
on the 1st of january 1901 the nation-state of australia officially came into existence as a federation . the australian continent was colonised by the united kingdom in 1788 , which subsequently established six , eventually self-governing , colonies there . in the 1890s the governments of these colonies all held referendums on becoming a unified , self-governing " commonwealth " within the british empire . when all the colonies voted in favour of federation , the federation of australia commenced , resulting in the establishment of the commonwealth of australia in 1901 . the model of australian federalism adheres closely to the original model of the united states of america , although it does so through a parliamentary westminster system rather than a presidential system .
extensive and diverse public spending is , in itself , inherently at risk of cronyism , kickbacks , and embezzlement . complicated regulations and arbitrary , unsupervised official conduct exacerbate the problem . this is one argument for privatization and deregulation . opponents of privatization see the argument as ideological . the argument that corruption necessarily follows from the opportunity is weakened by the existence of countries with low to non-existent corruption but large public sectors , like the nordic countries . these countries score high on the ease of doing business index , due to good and often simple regulations , and have rule of law firmly established . therefore , due to their lack of corruption in the first place , they can run large public sectors without inducing political corruption . recent evidence that takes both the size of expenditures and regulatory complexity into account has found that high-income democracies with more expansive state sectors do indeed have higher levels of corruption .
paris has been an international capital of high fashion since the 19th century , particularly in the domain of haute couture , clothing hand-made to order for private clients . it is home of some of the largest fashion houses in the world , including dior and chanel , and of many well-known fashion designers , including karl lagerfeld , jean-paul gaultier , christophe josse and christian lacroix . paris fashion week , held in january and july in the carrousel du louvre and other city locations , is among the top four events of the international fashion calendar , along with the fashion weeks in milan , london and new york . paris is also the home of the world 's largest cosmetics company , l 'oreal , and three of the five top global makers of luxury fashion accessories ; louis vuitton , hermes and cartier .
from his early years , bell showed a sensitive nature and a talent for art , poetry , and music that was encouraged by his mother . with no formal training , he mastered the piano and became the family 's pianist . despite being normally quiet and introspective , he reveled in mimicry and " voice tricks " akin to ventriloquism that continually entertained family guests during their occasional visits . bell was also deeply affected by his mother 's gradual deafness , ( she began to lose her hearing when he was 12 ) and learned a manual finger language so he could sit at her side and tap out silently the conversations swirling around the family parlour . he also developed a technique of speaking in clear , modulated tones directly into his mother 's forehead wherein she would hear him with reasonable clarity . bell 's preoccupation with his mother 's deafness led him to study acoustics .
cross-cultural study of comics is complicated by the great difference in meaning and scope of the words for " comics " in different languages . the french term for comics , bandes dessinees ( " drawn strip " ) emphasizes the juxtaposition of drawn images as a defining factor , which can imply the exclusion of even photographic comics . the term manga is used in japanese to indicate all forms of comics , cartooning , and caricature .
chopin 's etudes are largely in straightforward ternary form . he used them to teach his own technique of piano playing - for instance playing double thirds ( op. 25 , no. 6 ) , playing in octaves ( op. 25 , no. 10 ) , and playing repeated notes ( op. 10 , no. 7 ) .
the shift in the cubs ' fortunes was characterized june 23 on the " nbc saturday game of the week " contest against the st. louis cardinals. it has since been dubbed simply " the sandberg game .

alaska regularly supports republicans in presidential elections and has done so since statehood . republicans have won the state 's electoral college votes in all but one election that it has participated in ( 1964 ) . no state has voted for a democratic presidential candidate fewer times . alaska was carried by democratic nominee lyndon b. johnson during his landslide election in 1964 , while the 1960 and 1968 elections were close . since 1972 , however , republicans have carried the state by large margins . in 2008 , republican john mccain defeated democrat barack obama in alaska , 59.49 % to 37.83 % . mccain 's running mate was sarah palin , the state 's governor and the first alaskan on a major party ticket . obama lost alaska again in 2012 , but he captured 40 % of the state 's vote in that election , making him the first democrat to do so since 1968 .
the editor , larry lamb , was originally from a labour background , with a socialist upbringing while his temporary replacement bernard shrimsley ( 1972-75 ) was a middle-class uncommitted conservative . an extensive advertising campaign on the itv network in this period , voiced by actor christopher timothy , may have helped the sun to overtake the daily mirror 's circulation in 1978 . despite the industrial relations of the 1970s - the so-called " spanish practices " of the print unions - the sun was very profitable , enabling murdoch to expand his operations to the united states from 1973 .
since 1947 , canadian military units have participated in more than 200 operations worldwide , and completed 72 international operations . canadian soldiers , sailors , and aviators came to be considered world-class professionals through conspicuous service during these conflicts and the country 's integral participation in nato during the cold war , first gulf war , kosovo war , and in united nations peacekeeping operations , such as the suez crisis , golan heights , cyprus , croatia , bosnia , afghanistan , and libya . canada maintained an aircraft carrier from 1957 to 1970 during the cold war , which never saw combat but participated in patrols during the cuban missile crisis .
in may 2014 , the government of china banned the internal purchase of windows 8-based products under government contracts requiring " energy-efficient " devices . the xinhua news agency claimed that windows 8 was being banned in protest of microsoft 's support lifecycle policy and the end of support for windows xp ( which , as of january 2014 , had a market share of 49 % in china ) , as the government " obviously cannot ignore the risks of running os [ sic ] without guaranteed technical support . " however , ni guangnan of the chinese academy of sciences had also previously warned that windows 8 could allegedly expose users to surveillance by the united states government due to its heavy use of internet-based services .
the unicameral legislature ( the fono ) consists of 49 members serving 5-year terms . forty-seven are matai title-holders elected from territorial districts by samoans ; the other two are chosen by non-samoans with no chiefly affiliation on separate electoral rolls . universal suffrage was adopted in 1990 , but only chiefs ( matai ) may stand for election to the samoan seats . there are more than 25,000 matais in the country , about 5 % of whom are women . the prime minister , chosen by a majority in the fono , is appointed by the head of state to form a government . the prime minister 's choices for the 12 cabinet positions are appointed by the head of state , subject to the continuing confidence of the fono .
mining was important in thuringia since the later middle ages , especially within the mining towns of the thuringian forest such as schmalkalden , suhl and ilmenau . following the industrial revolution , the old iron , copper and silver mines declined because the competition from imported metal was too strong . on the other hand , the late 19th century brought new types of mines to thuringia : the lignite surface mining around meuselwitz near altenburg in the east of the land started in the 1870s , and two potash mining districts were established around 1900 . these are the sudharzrevier in the north of the state , between bischofferode in the west and roßleben in the east with sondershausen at its centre , and the werrarevier on the hessian border around vacha and bad salzungen in the west . together , they accounted for a significant part of the world 's potash production in the mid-20th century . after the reunification , the sudharzrevier was abandoned , whereas k + s took over the mines in the werrarevier . between 1950 and 1990 , uranium mining was also important to cover the soviet union 's need for this metal . the centre was ronneburg near gera in eastern thuringia and the operating company wismut was under direct soviet control .
most notably , there was also a secret protocol to the pact , revealed only after germany 's defeat in 1945 , although hints about its provisions were leaked much earlier , e.g. , to influence lithuania . according to said protocol romania , poland , lithuania , latvia , estonia and finland were divided into german and soviet " spheres of influence . " in the north , finland , estonia and latvia were assigned to the soviet sphere . poland was to be partitioned in the event of its " political rearrangement " - the areas east of the pisa , narev , vistula and san rivers going to the soviet union while germany would occupy the west . lithuania , adjacent to east prussia , would be in the german sphere of influence , although a second secret protocol agreed to in september 1939 reassigned the majority of lithuania to the ussr . according to the secret protocol , lithuania would be granted the city of vilnius - its historical capital , which was under polish control during the inter-war period . another clause of the treaty was that germany would not interfere with the soviet union 's actions towards bessarabia , then part of romania ; as the result , bessarabia was joined to the moldovan assr , and become the moldovan ssr under control of moscow .
the persecution reached a peak in nazi germany 's final solution , which led to the holocaust and the slaughter of approximately 6 million jews . of the world 's 15 million jews in 1939 , more than a third were killed in the holocaust . the holocaust - the state-led systematic persecution and genocide of european jews ( and certain communities of north african jews in european controlled north africa ) and other minority groups of europe during world war ii by germany and its collaborators remains the most notable modern-day persecution of jews . the persecution and genocide were accomplished in stages . legislation to remove the jews from civil society was enacted years before the outbreak of world war ii . concentration camps were established in which inmates were used as slave labour until they died of exhaustion or disease . where the third reich conquered new territory in eastern europe , specialized units called einsatzgruppen murdered jews and political opponents in mass shootings . jews and roma were crammed into ghettos before being transported hundreds of miles by freight train to extermination camps where , if they survived the journey , the majority of them were killed in gas chambers . virtually every arm of germany 's bureaucracy was involved in the logistics of the mass murder , turning the country into what one holocaust scholar has called " a genocidal nation . "
in polygynous species with considerable sexual dimorphism , males tend to return earlier to the breeding sites than their females . this is termed protandry .

un forces retreated to suwon in the west , wonju in the center , and the territory north of samcheok in the east , where the battlefront stabilized and held . the pva had outrun its logistics capability and thus were unable to press on beyond seoul as food , ammunition , and materiel were carried nightly , on foot and bicycle , from the border at the yalu river to the three battle lines . in late january , upon finding that the pva had abandoned their battle lines , general ridgway ordered a reconnaissance-in-force , which became operation roundup ( 5 february 1951 ) . a full-scale x corps advance proceeded , which fully exploited the un command 's air superiority , concluding with the un reaching the han river and recapturing wonju .
early islamic philosophy and islamic metaphysics , imbued as it is with islamic theology , distinguishes more clearly than aristotelianism between essence and existence . whereas existence is the domain of the contingent and the accidental , essence endures within a being beyond the accidental . the philosophy of ibn sina , particularly that part relating to metaphysics , owes much to al-farabi . the search for a definitive islamic philosophy separate from occasionalism can be seen in what is left of his work .
in 2011 , a welsh club participated in the premier league for the first time after swansea city gained promotion . the first premier league match to be played outside england was swansea city 's home match at the liberty stadium against wigan athletic on 20 august 2011 . in 2012-13 , swansea qualified for the europa league by winning the league cup . the number of welsh clubs in the premier league increased to two for the first time in 2013-14 , as cardiff city gained promotion , but cardiff city was relegated after its maiden season .
ipod batteries are not designed to be removed or replaced by the user , although some users have been able to open the case themselves , usually following instructions from third-party vendors of ipod replacement batteries . compounding the problem , apple initially would not replace worn-out batteries . the official policy was that the customer should buy a refurbished replacement ipod , at a cost almost equivalent to a brand new one . all lithium-ion batteries lose capacity during their lifetime even when not in use ( guidelines are available for prolonging life-span ) and this situation led to a market for third-party battery replacement kits .
the order of preachers ( latin : ordo praedicatorum , hence the abbreviation op used by members ) , more commonly known after the 15th century as the dominican order or dominicans , is a roman catholic religious order founded by the spanish priest saint dominic de guzman in france and approved by pope honorius iii ( 1216-27 ) on 22 december 1216 . membership in this " mendicant " order includes friars , nuns , active sisters , and lay or secular dominicans ( formerly known as tertiaries , though recently there has been a growing number of associates , who are unrelated to the tertiaries ) affiliated with the order .
northwestern requires that all new buildings be leed-certified . silverman hall on the evanston campus was awarded gold leed certification in 2010 ; wieboldt hall on the chicago campus was awarded gold leed certification in 2007 , and the ford motor company engineering design center on the evanston campus was awarded silver leed certification in 2006 . new construction and renovation projects will be designed to provide at least a 20 % improvement over energy code requirements where technically feasible . the university also released at the beginning of the 2008-09 academic year the evanston campus framework plan , which outlines plans for future development of the evanston campus . the plan not only emphasizes the sustainable construction of buildings , but also discusses improving transportation by optimizing pedestrian and bicycle access . northwestern has had a comprehensive recycling program in place since 1990 . annually more than 1,500 tons are recycled at northwestern , which represents 30 % of the waste produced on campus . additionally , all landscape waste at the university is composted .
german historian reinhart koselleck claimed that " on the continent there were two social structures that left a decisive imprint on the age of enlightenment : the republic of letters and the masonic lodges . " scottish professor thomas munck argues that " although the masons did promote international and cross-social contacts which were essentially non-religious and broadly in agreement with enlightened values , they can hardly be described as a major radical or reformist network in their own right . " many of the masons values seemed to greatly appeal to enlightenment values and thinkers . diderot discusses the link between freemason ideals and the enlightenment in d 'alembert 's dream , exploring masonry as a way of spreading enlightenment beliefs . historian margaret jacob stresses the importance of the masons in indirectly inspiring enlightened political thought . on the negative side , daniel roche contests claims that masonry promoted egalitarianism . he argues that the lodges only attracted men of similar social backgrounds . the presence of noble women in the french " lodges of adoption " that formed in the 1780s was largely due to the close ties shared between these lodges and aristocratic society .
reform of the liturgy had been a part of the liturgical movements in the 20th century mainly in france , and germany which were officially recognized by pius xii in his encyclical mediator dei . during the pontificate of pius xii , the vatican eased regulations on the use of latin in roman catholic liturgies , permitting some use of vernacular languages during baptisms , funerals and other events . in 1951 and 1955 , the easter liturgies underwent revision , most notably including the reintroduction of the easter triduum . the second vatican council made no changes to the roman missal , but in the document sacrosanctum concilium mandated that a general revision of it take place . after the vatican council , in april 1969 , paul vi approved the " new order of mass " promulgated in 1970 , as stated in the acta apostolica sedis to " end experimentation " with the mass and which included the introduction of three new eucharistic prayers to what was up to then a single roman canon .
hdtv technology was introduced in the united states in the late 1980s and made official in 1993 by the digital hdtv grand alliance , a group of television , electronic equipment , communications companies consisting of at & t bell labs , general instrument , philips , sarnoff , thomson , zenith and the massachusetts institute of technology . field testing of hdtv at 199 sites in the united states was completed august 14 , 1994 . the first public hdtv broadcast in the united states occurred on july 23 , 1996 when the raleigh , north carolina television station wral-hd began broadcasting from the existing tower of wral-tv southeast of raleigh , winning a race to be first with the hd model station in washington , d.c. , which began broadcasting july 31 , 1996 with the callsign whd-tv , based out of the facilities of nbc owned and operated station wrc-tv . the american advanced television systems committee ( atsc ) hdtv system had its public launch on october 29 , 1998 , during the live coverage of astronaut john glenn 's return mission to space on board the space shuttle discovery . the signal was transmitted coast-to-coast , and was seen by the public in science centers , and other public theaters specially equipped to receive and display the broadcast .

richmond recovered quickly from the war , and by 1782 was once again a thriving city . in 1786 , the virginia statute for religious freedom ( drafted by thomas jefferson ) was passed at the temporary capitol in richmond , providing the basis for the separation of church and state , a key element in the development of the freedom of religion in the united states . a permanent home for the new government , the virginia state capitol building , was designed by thomas jefferson with the assistance of charles-louis clerisseau , and was completed in 1788 .
in the 2000s , more venezuelans opposing the economic and political policies of president hugo chavez migrated to the united states ( mostly to florida , but new york city and houston are other destinations ) . the largest concentration of venezuelans in the united states is in south florida , especially the suburbs of doral and weston . other main states with venezuelan american populations are , according to the 1990 census , new york , california , texas ( adding their existing hispanic populations ) , new jersey , massachusetts and maryland . some of the urban areas with a high venezuelan community include miami , new york city , los angeles , and washington , d.c .
the standard output sensitivity ( sos ) technique , also new in the 2006 version of the standard , effectively specifies that the average level in the srgb image must be 18 % gray plus or minus 1 / 3 stop when the exposure is controlled by an automatic exposure control system calibrated per iso 2721 and set to the ei with no exposure compensation . because the output level is measured in the srgb output from the camera , it is only applicable to srgb images - typically jpeg - and not to output files in raw image format . it is not applicable when multi-zone metering is used .
the tradition holds that virgil was born in the village of andes , near mantua in cisalpine gaul . analysis of his name has led to beliefs that he descended from earlier roman colonists . modern speculation ultimately is not supported by narrative evidence either from his own writings or his later biographers . macrobius says that virgil 's father was of a humble background ; however , scholars generally believe that virgil was from an equestrian landowning family which could afford to give him an education . he attended schools in cremona , mediolanum , rome and naples . after considering briefly a career in rhetoric and law , the young virgil turned his talents to poetry .
the sun has been openly antagonistic towards other european nations , particularly the french and germans . during the 1980s and 1990s , the nationalities were routinely described in copy and headlines as " frogs , " " krauts " or " hun .

the swiss climate is generally temperate , but can vary greatly between the localities , from glacial conditions on the mountaintops to the often pleasant near mediterranean climate at switzerland 's southern tip . there are some valley areas in the southern part of switzerland where some cold-hardy palm trees are found . summers tend to be warm and humid at times with periodic rainfall so they are ideal for pastures and grazing . the less humid winters in the mountains may see long intervals of stable conditions for weeks , while the lower lands tend to suffer from inversion , during these periods , thus seeing no sun for weeks .
hunting in the united states is not associated with any particular class or culture ; a 2006 poll showed seventy-eight percent of americans supported legal hunting , although relatively few americans actually hunt . at the beginning of the 21st century , just six percent of americans hunted . southerners in states along the eastern seaboard hunted at a rate of five percent , slightly below the national average , and while hunting was more common in other parts of the south at nine percent , these rates did not surpass those of the plains states , where twelve percent of midwesterners hunted . hunting in other areas of the country fell below the national average . overall , in the 1996-2006 period , the number of hunters over the age of sixteen declined by ten percent , a drop attributable to a number of factors including habitat loss and changes in recreation habits .
in 1982 , the band released the album hot space , a departure from their trademark seventies sound , this time being a mixture of rock , pop rock , dance , funk , and r & b. most of the album was recorded in munich during the most turbulent period in the band 's history , and taylor and may lamented the new sound , with both being very critical of the influence mercury 's personal manager paul prenter had on the singer . may was also scathing of prenter , who was mercury 's manager from the early 1980s to 1984 , for being dismissive of the importance of radio stations , such as the us networks , and their vital connection between the artist and the community , and for denying them access to mercury . the band stopped touring north america after their hot space tour , as their success there had waned , although they would perform on american television for the only time during the eighth season premiere of saturday night live . queen left elektra records , their label in the united states , canada , japan , australia , and new zealand , and signed onto emi / capitol records .

the interstate highway system is officially known as the ' dwight d. eisenhower national system of interstate and defense highways ' in his honor . it was inspired in part by eisenhower 's own army experiences in world war ii , where he recognized the advantages of the autobahn systems in germany , austria , and switzerland . commemorative signs reading " eisenhower interstate system " and bearing eisenhower 's permanent 5-star rank insignia were introduced in 1993 and are currently displayed throughout the interstate system . several highways are also named for him , including the eisenhower expressway ( interstate 290 ) near chicago and the eisenhower tunnel on interstate 70 west of denver .
lilius 's proposals had two components . firstly , he proposed a correction to the length of the year . the mean tropical year is 365.24219 days long . as the average length of a julian year is 365.25 days , the julian year is almost 11 minutes longer than the mean tropical year . the discrepancy results in a drift of about three days every 400 years . lilius 's proposal resulted in an average year of 365.2425 days ( see accuracy ) . at the time of gregory 's reform there had already been a drift of 10 days since the council of nicaea , resulting in the vernal equinox falling on 10 or 11 march instead of the ecclesiastically fixed date of 21 march , and if unreformed it would drift further . lilius proposed that the 10-day drift should be corrected by deleting the julian leap day on each of its ten occurrences over a period of forty years , thereby providing for a gradual return of the equinox to 21 march .
in 1870 , republican sentiment in britain , fed by the queen 's seclusion , was boosted after the establishment of the third french republic . a republican rally in trafalgar square demanded victoria 's removal , and radical mps spoke against her . in august and september 1871 , she was seriously ill with an abscess in her arm , which joseph lister successfully lanced and treated with his new antiseptic carbolic acid spray . in late november 1871 , at the height of the republican movement , the prince of wales contracted typhoid fever , the disease that was believed to have killed his father , and victoria was fearful her son would die . as the tenth anniversary of her husband 's death approached , her son 's condition grew no better , and victoria 's distress continued . to general rejoicing , he pulled through . mother and son attended a public parade through london and a grand service of thanksgiving in st paul 's cathedral on 27 february 1872 , and republican feeling subsided .
special guest referees may be used from time to time ; by virtue of their celebrity status , they are often scripted to dispense with the appearance of neutrality and use their influence to unfairly influence the outcome of the match for added dramatic impact . face special referees will often fight back against hostile heel wrestlers , particularly if the special referee is either a wrestler themselves or a famous martial artist ( such as tito ortiz in the main event at tna 's thard justice in 2005 ) . they also have the power to eject from ringside any of the heel wrestler 's entourage / stable , who may otherwise interfere with the match .
napoleon continued to entertain a grand scheme to establish a french presence in the middle east in order to put pressure on britain and russia , and perhaps form an alliance with the ottoman empire . in february 1806 , ottoman emperor selim iii finally recognized napoleon as emperor . he also opted for an alliance with france , calling france " our sincere and natural ally . " that decision brought the ottoman empire into a losing war against russia and britain . a franco-persian alliance was also formed between napoleon and the persian empire of fat ′ h-ali shah qajar . it collapsed in 1807 , when france and russia themselves formed an unexpected alliance . in the end , napoleon had made no effective alliances in the middle east .

as the tokugawa period progressed more value became placed on education , and the education of females beginning at a young age became important to families and society as a whole . marriage criteria began to weigh intelligence and education as desirable attributes in a wife , right along with physical attractiveness . though many of the texts written for women during the tokugawa period only pertained to how a woman could become a successful wife and household manager , there were those that undertook the challenge of learning to read , and also tackled philosophical and literary classics . nearly all women of the samurai class were literate by the end of the tokugawa period .
since the early 1960s , theoretical linguists have moved away from the traditional concept of a phoneme , preferring to consider basic units at a more abstract level , as a component of morphemes ; these units can be called morphophonemes , and analysis using this approach is called morphophonology .
during the revival , in 1809 linguist and historian josef dobrovsky released a german-language grammar of old czech entitled ausfuhrliches lehrgebaude der bohmischen sprache ( comprehensive doctrine of the bohemian language ) . dobrovsky had intended his book to be descriptive , and did not think czech had a realistic chance of returning as a major language . however , josef jungmann and other revivalists used dobrovsky 's book to advocate for a czech linguistic revival . changes during this time included spelling reform ( notably , i in place of the former j and j in place of g ) , the use of t ( rather than ti ) to end infinitive verbs and the non-capitalization of nouns ( which had been a late borrowing from german ) . these changes differentiated czech from slovak . modern scholars disagree about whether the conservative revivalists were motivated by nationalism or considered contemporary spoken czech unsuitable for formal , widespread use .

television money had also become much more important ; the football league received £ 6.3 million for a two-year agreement in 1986 , but when that deal was renewed in 1988 , the price rose to £ 44 million over four years . the 1988 negotiations were the first signs of a breakaway league ; ten clubs threatened to leave and form a " super league , " but were eventually persuaded to stay . as stadiums improved and match attendance and revenues rose , the country 's top teams again considered leaving the football league in order to capitalise on the growing influx of money being pumped into the sport .
remodelling of the structure began in 1762 . after his accession to the throne in 1820 , king george iv continued the renovation with the idea in mind of a small , comfortable home . while the work was in progress , in 1826 , the king decided to modify the house into a palace with the help of his architect john nash . some furnishings were transferred from carlton house , and others had been bought in france after the french revolution . the external facade was designed keeping in mind the french neo-classical influence preferred by george iv . the cost of the renovations grew dramatically , and by 1829 the extravagance of nash 's designs resulted in his removal as architect . on the death of george iv in 1830 , his younger brother king william iv hired edward blore to finish the work . at one stage , william considered converting the palace into the new houses of parliament , after the destruction of the palace of westminster by fire in 1834 .

in europe , it is the provision of accommodation , if anything , that now distinguishes inns from taverns , alehouses and pubs . the latter tend to provide alcohol ( and , in the uk , soft drinks and often food ) , but less commonly accommodation . inns tend to be older and grander establishments : historically they provided not only food and lodging , but also stabling and fodder for the traveller 's horse ( s ) and on some roads fresh horses for the mail coach . famous london inns include the george , southwark and the tabard . there is however no longer a formal distinction between an inn and other kinds of establishment . many pubs use " inn " in their name , either because they are long established former coaching inns , or to summon up a particular kind of image , or in many cases simply as a pun on the word " in , " as in " the welcome inn , " the name of many pubs in scotland .
marshal macmahon , now closest to wissembourg , spread his four divisions over 20 miles ( 32 km ) to react to any prussian invasion . this organization of forces was due to a lack of supplies , forcing each division to seek out basic provisions along with the representatives of the army supply arm that was supposed to aid them . what made a bad situation much worse was the conduct of general auguste-alexandre ducrot , commander of the 1st division . he told general abel douay , commander of the 2nd division , on 1 august that " the information i have received makes me suppose that the enemy has no considerable forces very near his advance posts , and has no desire to take the offensive . " two days later , he told macmahon that he had not found " a single enemy post ... it looks to me as if the menace of the bavarians is simply bluff . " even though ducrot shrugged off the possibility of an attack by the germans , macmahon tried to warn the other divisions of his army , without success .
in the 1874 general election , disraeli was returned to power . he passed the public worship regulation act 1874 , which removed catholic rituals from the anglican liturgy and which victoria strongly supported . she preferred short , simple services , and personally considered herself more aligned with the presbyterian church of scotland than the episcopal church of england . he also pushed the royal titles act 1876 through parliament , so that victoria took the title " empress of india " from 1 may 1876 . the new title was proclaimed at the delhi durbar of 1 january 1877 .

the term " post-punk " was first used by journalists in the late 1970s to describe groups moving beyond punk 's sonic template into disparate areas . many of these artists , initially inspired by punk 's diy ethic and energy , ultimately became disillusioned with the style and movement , feeling that it had fallen into commercial formula , rock convention and self-parody . they repudiated its populist claims to accessibility and raw simplicity , instead seeing an opportunity to break with musical tradition , subvert commonplaces and challenge audiences . artists moved beyonds punk 's focus on the concerns of a largely white , male , working class population and abandoned its continued reliance on established rock and roll tropes , such as three-chord progressions and chuck berry-based guitar riffs . these artists instead defined punk as " an imperative to constant change , " believing that " radical content demands radical form . "
a major problem in the managing of the luftwaffe was hermann goring . hitler believed the luftwaffe was " the most effective strategic weapon , " and in reply to repeated requests from the kriegsmarine for control over aircraft insisted , " we should never have been able to hold our own in this war if we had not had an undivided luftwaffe . " such principles made it much harder to integrate the air force into the overall strategy and produced in goring a jealous and damaging defence of his " empire " while removing hitler voluntarily from the systematic direction of the luftwaffe at either the strategic or operational level . when hitler tried to intervene more in the running of the air force later in the war , he was faced with a political conflict of his own making between himself and goring , which was not fully resolved until the war was almost over . in 1940 and 1941 , goring 's refusal to cooperate with the kriegsmarine denied the entire wehrmacht military forces of the reich the chance to strangle british sea communications , which might have had strategic or decisive effect in the war against the british empire .
often , the migration route of a long-distance migrator bird doesn 't follow a straight line between breeding and wintering grounds . rather , it could follow an hooked or arched line , with detours around geographical barriers . for most land-birds , such barriers could consist in seas , large water bodies or high mountain ranges , because of the lack of stopover or feeding sites , or the lack of thermal columns for broad-winged birds .
since the carnation revolution of 1974 , which culminated in the end of one of portugal 's most notable phases of economic expansion ( that started in the 1960s ) , a significant change has occurred in the nation 's annual economic growth . [ citation needed ] after the turmoil of the 1974 revolution and the prec period , portugal tried to adapt to a changing modern global economy , a process that continues in 2013 . since the 1990s , portugal 's public consumption-based economic development model has been slowly changing to a system that is focused on exports , private investment and the development of the high-tech sector . consequently , business services have overtaken more traditional industries such as textiles , clothing , footwear and cork ( portugal is the world 's leading cork producer ) , wood products and beverages .
the crimean war was one of the first conflicts to use modern technologies such as explosive naval shells , railways , and telegraphs . ( preface ) the war was one of the first to be documented extensively in written reports and photographs . as the legend of the " charge of the light brigade " demonstrates , the war quickly became an iconic symbol of logistical , medical and tactical failures and mismanagement . the reaction in the uk was a demand for professionalization , most famously achieved by florence nightingale , who gained worldwide attention for pioneering modern nursing while treating the wounded .

czech continued to evolve and gain in regional importance for hundreds of years , and has been a literary language in the slovak lands since the early fifteenth century . a biblical translation , the kralice bible , was published during the late sixteenth century ( around the time of the king james and luther versions ) which was more linguistically conservative than either . the publication of the kralice bible spawned widespread nationalism , and in 1615 the government of bohemia ruled that only czech-speaking residents would be allowed to become full citizens or inherit goods or land . this , and the conversion of the czech upper classes from the habsburg empire 's catholicism to protestantism , angered the habsburgs and helped trigger the thirty years ' war ( where the czechs were defeated at the battle of white mountain ) . the czechs became serfs ; bohemia 's printing industry ( and its linguistic and political rights ) were dismembered , removing official regulation and support from its language . german quickly became the dominant language in bohemia .
the consolidation of the bronx into new york city proceeded in two stages . in 1873 , the state legislature annexed kingsbridge , west farms and morrisania to new york , effective in 1874 ; the three towns were abolished in the process . in 1895 , three years before new york 's consolidation with brooklyn , queens and staten island , the whole of the territory east of the bronx river , including the town of westchester ( which had voted in 1894 against consolidation ) and portions of eastchester and pelham , were annexed to the city . city island , a nautical community , voted to join the city in 1896 .

this boom was reflected in the growth of artistic and cultural pursuits . some of the most emblematic buildings of the city were built during this period , including the serranos towers ( 1392 ) , the lonja ( 1482 ) , the miguelete and the chapel of the kings of the convent of santo domingo . in painting and sculpture , flemish and italian trends had an influence on artists such as lluis dalmau , peris goncal and damia forment . literature flourished with the patronage of the court of alfonso the magnanimous , supporting authors like ausias march , roic de corella , and isabel de villena . by 1460 joanot martorell wrote tirant lo blanch , an innovative novel of chivalry that influenced many later writers , from cervantes to shakespeare . ausias march was one of the first poets to use the everyday language valencian , instead of the troubadour language , occitan . also around this time , between 1499 and 1502 , the university of valencia was founded under the parsimonious name of estudio general ( " studium generale , " place of general studies ) .
burmese , the mother tongue of the bamar and official language of myanmar , is related to tibetan and chinese language . it is written in a script consisting of circular and semi-circular letters , which were adapted from the mon script , which in turn was developed from a southern indian script in the 5th century . the earliest known inscriptions in the burmese script date from the 11th century . it is also used to write pali , the sacred language of theravada buddhism , as well as several ethnic minority languages , including shan , several karen dialects , and kayah ( karenni ) , with the addition of specialised characters and diacritics for each language .
militarization was another aspect of the soviet state . large parts of the country , especially the coastal areas , were closed to all but the soviet military . most of the sea shore and all sea islands ( including saaremaa and hiiumaa ) were declared " border zones . " people not actually residing there were restricted from travelling to them without a permit . a notable closed military installation was the city of paldiski , which was entirely closed to all public access . the city had a support base for the soviet baltic fleet 's submarines and several large military bases , including a nuclear submarine training centre complete with a full-scale model of a nuclear submarine with working nuclear reactors . the paldiski reactors building passed into estonian control in 1994 after the last russian troops left the country . immigration was another effect of soviet occupation . hundreds of thousands of migrants were relocated to estonia from other parts of the soviet union to assist industrialisation and militarisation , contributing an increase of about half a million people within 45 years .
for any constant c . matrix groups over these fields fall under this regime , as do adele rings and adelic algebraic groups , which are basic to number theory . galois groups of infinite field extensions such as the absolute galois group can also be equipped with a topology , the so-called krull topology , which in turn is central to generalize the above sketched connection of fields and groups to infinite field extensions . an advanced generalization of this idea , adapted to the needs of algebraic geometry , is the etale fundamental group .
yale university , one of the oldest universities in the united states , is a cultural referent as an institution that produces some of the most elite members of society and its grounds , alumni , and students have been prominently portrayed in fiction and u.s. popular culture . for example , owen johnson 's novel , stover at yale , follows the college career of dink stover and frank merriwell , the model for all later juvenile sports fiction , plays football , baseball , crew , and track at yale while solving mysteries and righting wrongs . yale university also is featured in f. scott fitzgerald 's novel " the great gatsby .

foot resigned and was replaced as leader by neil kinnock , with roy hattersley as his deputy . the new leadership progressively dropped unpopular policies . the miners strike of 1984-85 over coal mine closures , for which miners ' leader arthur scargill was blamed , and the wapping dispute led to clashes with the left of the party , and negative coverage in most of the press . tabloid vilification of the so-called loony left continued to taint the parliamentary party by association from the activities of ' extra-parliamentary ' militants in local government .
a new digimon series was announced 30 months after the end of digimon fusion at a 15th anniversary concert and theater event for the franchise in august 2014 . the series announced the return of the protagonists from the original digimon adventure series , most of them now as high school students . a countdown clicking game was posted on the show 's official website , offering news when specific clicks were met . on december 13 , 2014 the series title and a key visual featuring character designs by atsuya uki were revealed with keitaro motonaga announced as director with a tentative premiere date of spring , 2015 . however , on may 6 , 2015 , it was announced that tri. would not be a television series , but rather a 6-part theatrical film series . the films are being streamed in episodic format outside japan by crunchyroll and hulu from the same day they premiere on japanese theaters .
the farmer , or specifically the small landowner-cultivator , was ranked just below scholars and officials in the social hierarchy . other agricultural cultivators were of a lower status , such as tenants , wage laborers , and in rare cases slaves . artisans and craftsmen had a legal and socioeconomic status between that of owner-cultivator farmers and common merchants . state-registered merchants , who were forced by law to wear white-colored clothes and pay high commercial taxes , were considered by the gentry as social parasites with a contemptible status . these were often petty shopkeepers of urban marketplaces ; merchants such as industrialists and itinerant traders working between a network of cities could avoid registering as merchants and were often wealthier and more powerful than the vast majority of government officials . wealthy landowners , such as nobles and officials , often provided lodging for retainers who provided valuable work or duties , sometimes including fighting bandits or riding into battle . unlike slaves , retainers could come and go from their master 's home as they pleased . medical physicians , pig breeders , and butchers had a fairly high social status , while occultist diviners , runners , and messengers had low status .

in august 2013 , a launching ceremony for japan 's largest military ship since world war ii was held in yokohama . the 820-foot-long ( 250 m ) , 19,500-ton flattop izumo was deployed in march 2015 . the ship is able to carry up to 14 helicopters ; however , only seven asw helicopters and two sar helicopters were planned for the initial aircraft complement . for other operations , 400 troops and fifty 3.5 t trucks ( or equivalent equipment ) can also be carried . the flight deck has five helicopter landing spots that allow simultaneous landings or take-offs . the ship is equipped with two phalanx ciws and two searam for its defense . the destroyers of this class were initially intended to replace the two ships of the shirane class , which were originally scheduled to begin decommissioning in fy2014 .
a year before alfonso iii " the great " of asturias death , three of alfonso 's sons rose in rebellion and forced him to abdicate , partitioning the kingdom among them . the eldest son , garcia , became king of leon . the second son , ordono , reigned in galicia , while the third , fruela , received asturias with oviedo as his capital . alfonso died in zamora , probably in 910 . his former realm would be reunited when first garcia died childless and leon passed to ordono . he in turn died when his children were too young to ascend ; fruela became king of a reunited crown . his death the next year initiated a series of internecine struggles that led to unstable succession for over a century . it continued under that name [ clarification needed ] until incorporated into the kingdom of castile in 1230 , after ferdinand iii became joint king of the two kingdoms . this was done to avoid dynastic feuds and to maintain the christian kingdoms strong enough to prevent complete muslim take over of the iberian peninsula and to further the reconquista of iberia by christian armies .
in 1980 , when the stadium was in need of redesign to meet uefa criteria , the club raised money by offering supporters the opportunity to inscribe their name on the bricks for a small fee . the idea was popular with supporters , and thousands of people paid the fee . later this became the centre of controversy when media in madrid picked up reports that one of the stones was inscribed with the name of long-time real madrid chairman and franco supporter santiago bernabeu . in preparation for the 1992 summer olympics two tiers of seating were installed above the previous roofline . it has a current capacity of 99,354 making it the largest stadium in europe .
diagnosing active tuberculosis based only on signs and symptoms is difficult , as is diagnosing the disease in those who are immunosuppressed . a diagnosis of tb should , however , be considered in those with signs of lung disease or constitutional symptoms lasting longer than two weeks . a chest x-ray and multiple sputum cultures for acid-fast bacilli are typically part of the initial evaluation . interferon-γ release assays and tuberculin skin tests are of little use in the developing world . igra have similar limitations in those with hiv .
according to two researchers , nesse and williams , diarrhea may function as an evolved expulsion defense mechanism . as a result , if it is stopped , there might be a delay in recovery . they cite in support of this argument research published in 1973 that found that treating shigella with the anti-diarrhea drug ( co-phenotrope , lomotil ) caused people to stay feverish twice as long as those not so treated . the researchers indeed themselves observed that : " lomotil may be contraindicated in shigellosis . diarrhea may represent a defense mechanism . "
estimates of the recognized greek muslim minority , which is mostly located in thrace , range from 98,000 to 140,000 , ( about 1 % ) while the immigrant muslim community numbers between 200,000 and 300,000 . albanian immigrants to greece are usually associated with the muslim religion , although most are secular in orientation . following the 1919-1922 greco-turkish war and the 1923 treaty of lausanne , greece and turkey agreed to a population transfer based on cultural and religious identity . about 500,000 muslims from greece , predominantly those defined as turks , but also greek muslims like the vallahades of western macedonia , were exchanged with approximately 1,500,000 greeks from turkey . however , many refugees who settled in former ottoman muslim villages in central macedonia and were defined as christian orthodox caucasus greeks arrived from the former russian transcaucasus province of kars oblast after it had been retroceded to turkey but in the few years before the official population exchange .
eventually the 12-inch ( 300 mm ) 33 1 ⁄ 3 rpm lp prevailed as the predominant format for musical albums , and 10-inch lps were no longer issued . the last columbia records reissue of any frank sinatra songs on a 10-inch lp record was an album called hall of fame , cl 2600 , issued on october 26 , 1956 , containing six songs , one each by tony bennett , rosemary clooney , johnnie ray , frank sinatra , doris day , and frankie laine . the 10-inch lp however had a longer life in the united kingdom , where important early british rock and roll albums such as lonnie donegan 's lonnie donegan showcase and billy fury 's the sound of fury were released in that form . the 7-inch ( 175 mm ) 45 rpm disc or " single " established a significant niche for shorter duration discs , typically containing one item on each side . the 45 rpm discs typically emulated the playing time of the former 78 rpm discs , while the 12-inch lp discs eventually provided up to one half-hour of recorded material per side .
present-day mali was once part of three west african empires that controlled trans-saharan trade : the ghana empire , the mali empire ( for which mali is named ) , and the songhai empire . during its golden age , there was a flourishing of mathematics , astronomy , literature , and art . at its peak in 1300 , the mali empire covered an area about twice the size of modern-day france and stretched to the west coast of africa . in the late 19th century , during the scramble for africa , france seized control of mali , making it a part of french sudan . french sudan ( then known as the sudanese republic ) joined with senegal in 1959 , achieving independence in 1960 as the mali federation . shortly thereafter , following senegal 's withdrawal from the federation , the sudanese republic declared itself the independent republic of mali . after a long period of one-party rule , a coup in 1991 led to the writing of a new constitution and the establishment of mali as a democratic , multi-party state .
in the resulting battle of pusan perimeter ( august-september 1950 ) , the u.s. army withstood kpa attacks meant to capture the city at the naktong bulge , p 'ohang-dong , and taegu . the united states air force ( usaf ) interrupted kpa logistics with 40 daily ground support sorties that destroyed 32 bridges , halting most daytime road and rail traffic . kpa forces were forced to hide in tunnels by day and move only at night . to deny materiel to the kpa , the usaf destroyed logistics depots , petroleum refineries , and harbors , while the u.s. navy air forces attacked transport hubs . consequently , the over-extended kpa could not be supplied throughout the south . on 27 august , 67th fighter squadron aircraft mistakenly attacked facilities in chinese territory and the soviet union called the un security council 's attention to china 's complaint about the incident . the us proposed that a commission of india and sweden determine what the us should pay in compensation but the soviets vetoed the us proposal .

historians estimate that between the advent of islam in 650ce and the abolition of slavery in the arabian peninsula in the mid-20th century , 10 to 18 million sub-saharan black africans were enslaved by arab slave traders and transported to the arabian peninsula and neighboring countries . this number far exceeded the number of slaves who were taken to the americas . several factors affected the visibility of descendants of this diaspora in 21st-century arab societies : the traders shipped more female slaves than males , as there was a demand for them to serve as concubines in harems in the arabian peninsula and neighboring countries . male slaves were castrated in order to serve as harem guards . the death toll of black african slaves from forced labor was high . the mixed-race children of female slaves and arab owners were assimilated into the arab owners ' families under the patrilineal kinship system . as a result , few distinctive afro-arab black communities have survived in the arabian peninsula and neighboring countries .
because of the sudden loss of the new orleans franchise , the league announced in october that the beginning of the free agency period would be delayed in order to accommodate a dispersal draft . dates were eventually announced as december 2 for the dispersal draft and december 4 for free agency , but shortly before the draft the league issued a press release announcing the draft had been postponed one day to december 3 . shortly thereafter , another press release announced that the draft would be held on december 9 and free agency would commence on december 11 . however , the draft still never took place , and instead another press release was issued stating that both the draft and free agency had been postponed indefinitely . rumors began circulating that the league was in trouble and on the verge of folding , but owners denied those claims . it was soon revealed the players ' union had agreed to cut the salary cap for the 2009 season to prevent a total cessation of operations . however , the announced platinum equity investment never materialized .
there is active research to make computers out of many promising new types of technology , such as optical computers , dna computers , neural computers , and quantum computers . most computers are universal , and are able to calculate any computable function , and are limited only by their memory capacity and operating speed . however different designs of computers can give very different performance for particular problems ; for example quantum computers can potentially break some modern encryption algorithms ( by quantum factoring ) very quickly .
in the ottoman empire , these ideological reforms did not take place and these views did not integrate into common thought until much later . as well , there was no spread of this doctrine within the new world and the advanced civilizations of the aztec , maya , inca , mohican , delaware , huron and especially the iroquois . the iroquois philosophy in particular gave much to christian thought of the time and in many cases actually inspired some of the institutions adopted in the united states : for example , benjamin franklin was a great admirer of some of the methods of the iroquois confederacy , and much of early american literature emphasized the political philosophy of the natives .
wind instruments became more refined in the classical era . while double reeded instruments like the oboe and bassoon became somewhat standardized in the baroque , the clarinet family of single reeds was not widely used until mozart expanded its role in orchestral , chamber , and concerto settings .
in june 2014 , state broadcaster china central television ( cctv ) broadcast a news story further characterizing windows 8 as a threat to national security . the story featured an interview with ni guangnan , who stated that operating systems could aggregate " sensitive user information " that could be used to " understand the conditions and activities of our national economy and society , " and alleged that per documents leaked by edward snowden , the u.s. government had worked with microsoft to retrieve encrypted information . yang min , a computer scientist at fudan university , also stated that " the security features of windows 8 are basically to the benefit of microsoft , allowing them control of the users ' data , and that poses a big challenge to the national strategy for information security . " microsoft denied the claims in a number of posts on the chinese social network sina weibo , which stated that the company had never " assisted any government in an attack of another government or clients " or provided client data to the u.s. government , never " provided any government the authority to directly visit " or placed any backdoors in its products and services , and that it had never concealed government requests for client data .
hydrogen poses a number of hazards to human safety , from potential detonations and fires when mixed with air to being an asphyxiant in its pure , oxygen-free form . in addition , liquid hydrogen is a cryogen and presents dangers ( such as frostbite ) associated with very cold liquids . hydrogen dissolves in many metals , and , in addition to leaking out , may have adverse effects on them , such as hydrogen embrittlement , leading to cracks and explosions . hydrogen gas leaking into external air may spontaneously ignite . moreover , hydrogen fire , while being extremely hot , is almost invisible , and thus can lead to accidental burns .
apple announced a battery replacement program on november 14 , 2003 , a week before a high publicity stunt and website by the neistat brothers . the initial cost was us $ 99 , and it was lowered to us $ 59 in 2005 . one week later , apple offered an extended ipod warranty for us $ 59 . for the ipod nano , soldering tools are needed because the battery is soldered onto the main board . fifth generation ipods have their battery attached to the backplate with adhesive .
inimitability of the quran ( or " i 'jaz " ) is the belief that no human speech can match the quran in its content and form . the quran is considered an inimitable miracle by muslims , effective until the day of resurrection - and , thereby , the central proof granted to muhammad in authentication of his prophetic status . the concept of inimitability originates in the quran where in five different verses opponents are challenged to produce something like the quran : " if men and sprites banded together to produce the like of this quran they would never produce its like not though they backed one another . " so the suggestion is that if there are doubts concerning the divine authorship of the quran , come forward and create something like it . from the ninth century , numerous works appeared which studied the quran and examined its style and content . medieval muslim scholars including al-jurjani ( d . 1078 ) and al-baqillani ( d . 1013 ) have written treatises on the subject , discussed its various aspects , and used linguistic approaches to study the quran . others argue that the quran contains noble ideas , has inner meanings , maintained its freshness through the ages and has caused great transformations in individual level and in the history . some scholars state that the quran contains scientific information that agrees with modern science . the doctrine of miraculousness of the quran is further emphasized by muhammad 's illiteracy since the unlettered prophet could not have been suspected of composing the quran .
the son of an impoverished bedouin goat herder , gaddafi became involved in politics while at school in sabha , subsequently enrolling in the royal military academy , benghazi . founding a revolutionary cell within the military , in 1969 they seized power from the absolute monarchy of king idris in a bloodless coup . becoming chairman of the governing revolutionary command council ( rcc ) , gaddafi abolished the monarchy and proclaimed the republic . ruling by decree , he implemented measures to remove what he viewed as foreign imperialist influence from libya , and strengthened ties to arab nationalist governments . intent on pushing libya towards " islamic socialism , " he introduced sharia as the basis for the legal system and nationalized the oil industry , using the increased revenues to bolster the military , implement social programs and fund revolutionary militants across the world . in 1973 he initiated a " popular revolution " with the formation of general people 's committees ( gpcs ) , purported to be a system of direct democracy , but retained personal control over major decisions . he outlined his third international theory that year , publishing these ideas in the green book .

after the first world war , however , it became apparent that the number of mixed-race people was growing at a faster rate than the white population , and by 1930 fear of the " half-caste menace " undermining the white australia ideal from within was being taken as a serious concern . dr. cecil cook , the northern territory protector of natives , noted that :
a german ethnicity emerged in the course of the middle ages , ultimately as a result of the formation of the kingdom of germany within east francia and later the holy roman empire , beginning in the 9th century . the process was gradual and lacked any clear definition , and the use of exonyms designating " the germans " develops only during the high middle ages . the title of rex teutonicum " king of the germans " is first used in the late 11th century , by the chancery of pope gregory vii , to describe the future holy roman emperor of the german nation henry iv . natively , the term ein diutscher ( " a german " ) is used for the people of germany from the 12th century .

a commutator is a mechanism used to switch the input of most dc machines and certain ac machines consisting of slip ring segments insulated from each other and from the electric motor 's shaft . the motor 's armature current is supplied through the stationary brushes in contact with the revolving commutator , which causes required current reversal and applies power to the machine in an optimal manner as the rotor rotates from pole to pole . in absence of such current reversal , the motor would brake to a stop . in light of significant advances in the past few decades due to improved technologies in electronic controller , sensorless control , induction motor , and permanent magnet motor fields , electromechanically commutated motors are increasingly being displaced by externally commutated induction and permanent-magnet motors .
the largest and bloodiest american battle came at okinawa , as the u.s. sought airbases for 3,000 b-29 bombers and 240 squadrons of b-17 bombers for the intense bombardment of japan 's home islands in preparation for a full-scale invasion in late 1945 . the japanese , with 115,000 troops augmented by thousands of civilians on the heavily populated island , did not resist on the beaches - their strategy was to maximize the number of soldier and marine casualties , and naval losses from kamikaze attacks . after an intense bombardment the americans landed on 1 april 1945 and declared victory on 21 june . the supporting naval forces were the targets for 4,000 sorties , many by kamikaze suicide planes . u.s. losses totaled 38 ships of all types sunk and 368 damaged with 4,900 sailors killed . the americans suffered 75,000 casualties on the ground ; 94 % of the japanese soldiers died along with many civilians .
scotland , meanwhile had remained an independent kingdom . in 1603 , that changed when the king of scotland inherited the crown of england , and consequently the crown of ireland also . the subsequent 17th century was one of political upheaval , religious division and war . english colonialism in ireland of the 16th century was extended by large-scale scottish and english colonies in ulster . religious division heightened and the king in england came into conflict with parliament . a prime issue was , inter alia , over his policy of tolerance towards catholicism . the resulting english civil war or war of the three kingdoms led to a revolutionary republic in england . ireland , largely catholic was mainly loyal to the king . following defeat to the parliaments army , large scale land distributions from loyalist irish nobility to english commoners in the service of the parliamentary army created the beginnings a new ascendancy class which over the next hundred years would obliterate the english ( hiberno-norman ) and gaelic irish nobility in ireland . the new ruling class was protestant and british , whilst the common people were largely catholic and irish . this theme would influence irish politics for centuries to come . when the monarchy was restored in england , the king found it politically impossible to restore all the lands of former land-owners in ireland . the " glorious revolution " of 1688 repeated similar themes : a catholic king pushing for religious tolerance in opposition to a protestant parliament in england . the king 's army was defeated at the battle of the boyne and at the militarily crucial battle of aughrim in ireland . resistance held out , and a guarantee of religious tolerance was a cornerstone of the treaty of limerick . however , in the evolving political climate , the terms of limerick were superseded , a new monarchy was installed , and the new irish parliament was packed with the new elite which legislated increasing intolerant penal laws , which discommoded both dissenters and catholics .
on march 30 , 2015 , it was announced that west is a co-owner , with various other music artists , in the music streaming service tidal . the service specialises in lossless audio and high definition music videos . jay z acquired the parent company of tidal , aspiro , in the first quarter of 2015 . including beyonce and jay-z , sixteen artist stakeholders ( such as rihanna , beyonce , madonna , chris martin , nicki minaj and more ) co-own tidal , with the majority owning a 3 % equity stake . the idea of having an all artist owned streaming service was created by those involved to adapt to the increased demand for streaming within the current music industry , and to rival other streaming services such as spotify , which have been criticised for their low payout of royalties . " the challenge is to get everyone to respect music again , to recognize its value , " stated jay-z on the release of tidal .
schwarzenegger has been a registered republican for many years . as an actor , his political views were always well known as they contrasted with those of many other prominent hollywood stars , who are generally considered to be a liberal and democratic-leaning community . at the 2004 republican national convention , schwarzenegger gave a speech and explained why he was a republican :
after the decline of aksum , the eritrean highlands were under the domain of bahr negash ruled by the bahr negus . the area was then known as ma 'ikele bahr ( " between the seas / rivers , " i.e. the land between the red sea and the mereb river ) . it was later renamed under emperor zara yaqob as the domain of the bahr negash , the medri bahri ( " sea land " in tingrinya , although it included some areas like shire on the other side of the mereb , today in ethiopia ) . with its capital at debarwa , the state 's main provinces were hamasien , serae and akele guzai .
hitler 's fierce anti-soviet rhetoric was one of the reasons why the uk and france decided that soviet participation in the 1938 munich conference regarding czechoslovakia would be both dangerous and useless . the munich agreement that followed marked a partial german annexation of czechoslovakia in late 1938 followed by its complete dissolution in march 1939 , which as part of the appeasement of germany conducted by chamberlain 's and daladier 's cabinets . this policy immediately raised the question of whether the soviet union could avoid being next on hitler 's list . the soviet leadership believed that the west wanted to encourage german aggression in the east and that france and britain might stay neutral in a war initiated by germany , hoping that the warring states would wear each other out and put an end to both the soviet union and nazi germany .
the story focuses on series protagonist link , who tries to prevent hyrule from being engulfed by a corrupted parallel dimension known as the twilight realm . to do so , he takes the form of both a hylian and a wolf , and is assisted by a mysterious creature named midna . the game takes place hundreds of years after ocarina of time and majora 's mask , in an alternate timeline from the wind waker .
there was a linguistic predisposition to use such terms . the romans had used them in near gaul / far gaul , near spain / far spain and others . before them the greeks had the habit , which appears in linear b , the oldest known script of europe , referring to the near province and the far province of the kingdom of pylos . usually these terms were given with reference to a geographic feature , such as a mountain range or a river .
albert einstein proposed that the laws of physics should be based on the principle of relativity . this principle holds that the rules of physics must be the same for all observers , regardless of the frame of reference that is used , and that light propagates at the same speed in all reference frames . this theory was motivated by maxwell 's equations , which show that electromagnetic waves propagate in a vacuum at the speed of light . however , maxwell 's equations give no indication of what this speed is relative to . prior to einstein , it was thought that this speed was relative to a fixed medium , called the luminiferous ether . in contrast , the theory of special relativity postulates that light propagates at the speed of light in all inertial frames , and examines the implications of this postulate .
the 45 rpm discs also came in a variety known as extended play ( ep ) , which achieved up to 10-15 minutes play at the expense of attenuating ( and possibly compressing ) the sound to reduce the width required by the groove . ep discs were cheaper to produce , and were used in cases where unit sales were likely to be more limited or to reissue lp albums on the smaller format for those people who had only 45 rpm players . lp albums could be purchased 1 ep at a time , with four items per ep , or in a boxed set with 3 eps or 12 items . the large center hole on 45s allows for easier handling by jukebox mechanisms . eps were generally discontinued by the late 1950s in the u.s. as three- and four-speed record players replaced the individual 45 players . one indication of the decline of the 45 rpm ep is that the last columbia records reissue of frank sinatra songs on 45 rpm ep records , called frank sinatra ( columbia b-2641 ) was issued on december 7 , 1959 . the ep lasted considerably longer in europe , and was a popular format during the 1960s for recordings by artists such as serge gainsbourg and the beatles .
methodism identifies principally with the theology of john wesley - an anglican priest and evangelist . this evangelical movement originated as a revival within the 18th-century church of england and became a separate church following wesley 's death . because of vigorous missionary activity , the movement spread throughout the british empire , the united states , and beyond , today claiming approximately 80 million adherents worldwide . originally it appealed especially to workers , agricultural workers , and slaves .
kerry received his second purple heart for a wound received in action on the bo đe river on february 20 , 1969 . the plan had been for the swift boats to be accompanied by support helicopters . on the way up the bo de , however , the helicopters were attacked . as the swift boats reached the cua lon river , kerry 's boat was hit by a b-40 rocket ( rocket propelled grenade round ) , and a piece of shrapnel hit kerry 's left leg , wounding him . thereafter , enemy fire ceased and his boat reached the gulf of thailand safely . kerry continues to have shrapnel embedded in his left thigh because the doctors that first treated him decided to remove the damaged tissue and close the wound with sutures rather than make a wide opening to remove the shrapnel . though wounded like several others earlier that day , kerry did not lose any time off from duty .
during the dictatorships of miguel primo de rivera ( 1923-1930 ) and especially of francisco franco ( 1939-1975 ) , all regional cultures were suppressed . all of the languages spoken in spanish territory , except spanish ( castilian ) itself , were officially banned . symbolising the catalan people 's desire for freedom , barca became ' more than a club ' ( mes que un club ) for the catalans . according to manuel vazquez montalban , the best way for the catalans to demonstrate their identity was by joining barca . it was less risky than joining a clandestine anti-franco movement , and allowed them to express their dissidence . during franco 's regime , however , the blaugrana team was granted profit due to its good relationship with the dictator at management level , even giving two awards to him .
the most innovative period of cubism was before 1914 . after world war i , with the support given by the dealer leonce rosenberg , cubism returned as a central issue for artists , and continued as such until the mid-1920s when its avant-garde status was rendered questionable by the emergence of geometric abstraction and surrealism in paris . many cubists , including picasso , braque , gris , leger , gleizes , and metzinger , while developing other styles , returned periodically to cubism , even well after 1925 . cubism reemerged during the 1920s and the 1930s in the work of the american stuart davis and the englishman ben nicholson . in france , however , cubism experienced a decline beginning in about 1925 . leonce rosenberg exhibited not only the artists stranded by kahnweiler 's exile but others including laurens , lipchitz , metzinger , gleizes , csaky , herbin and severini . in 1918 rosenberg presented a series of cubist exhibitions at his galerie de l 'effort moderne in paris . attempts were made by louis vauxcelles to claim that cubism was dead , but these exhibitions , along with a well-organized cubist show at the 1920 salon des independants and a revival of the salon de la section d 'or in the same year , demonstrated it was still alive .
eisenhower returned to the u.s. in december 1939 and was assigned as a battalion commander and regimental executive officer of the 15th infantry at fort lewis , washington . in march 1941 he was promoted to colonel and assigned as chief of staff of the newly activated ix corps under major general kenyon joyce . in june 1941 , he was appointed chief of staff to general walter krueger , commander of the 3rd army , at fort sam houston in san antonio , texas . after successfully participating in the louisiana maneuvers , he was promoted to brigadier general on october 3 , 1941 . although his administrative abilities had been noticed , on the eve of the u.s. entry into world war ii he had never held an active command above a battalion and was far from being considered by many as a potential commander of major operations .
new york city has the largest european and non-hispanic white population of any american city . at 2.7 million in 2012 , new york 's non-hispanic white population is larger than the non-hispanic white populations of los angeles ( 1.1 million ) , chicago ( 865,000 ) , and houston ( 550,000 ) combined . the european diaspora residing in the city is very diverse . according to 2012 census estimates , there were roughly 560,000 italian americans , 385,000 irish americans , 253,000 german americans , 223,000 russian americans , 201,000 polish americans , and 137,000 english americans . additionally , greek and french americans numbered 65,000 each , with those of hungarian descent estimated at 60,000 people . ukrainian and scottish americans numbered 55,000 and 35,000 , respectively . people identifying ancestry from spain numbered 30,838 total in 2010 . people of norwegian and swedish descent both stood at about 20,000 each , while people of czech , lithuanian , portuguese , scotch-irish , and welsh descent all numbered between 12,000-14,000 people . arab americans number over 160,000 in new york city , with the highest concentration in brooklyn . central asians , primarily uzbek americans , are a rapidly growing segment of the city 's non-hispanic white population , enumerating over 30,000 , and including over half of all central asian immigrants to the united states , most settling in queens or brooklyn . albanian americans are most highly concentrated in the bronx .
widespread segregation in 19th- and early 20th-century north america made it difficult for african-americans to join lodges outside of prince hall jurisdictions - and impossible for inter-jurisdiction recognition between the parallel u.s. masonic authorities . by the 1980s , such discrimination was a thing of the past , and today most u.s. grand lodges recognise their prince hall counterparts , and the authorities of both traditions are working towards full recognition . the united grand lodge of england has no problem with recognising prince hall grand lodges . while celebrating their heritage as lodges of black americans , prince hall is open to all men regardless of race or religion .
the instruments currently used in most classical music were largely invented before the mid-19th century ( often much earlier ) and codified in the 18th and 19th centuries . they consist of the instruments found in an orchestra or in a concert band , together with several other solo instruments ( such as the piano , harpsichord , and organ ) . the symphony orchestra is the most widely known medium for classical music and includes members of the string , woodwind , brass , and percussion families of instruments . the concert band consists of members of the woodwind , brass , and percussion families . it generally has a larger variety and amount of woodwind and brass instruments than the orchestra but does not have a string section . however , many concert bands use a double bass . the vocal practices changed a great deal over the classical period , from the single line monophonic gregorian chant done by monks in the medieval period to the complex , polyphonic choral works of the renaissance and subsequent periods , which used multiple independent vocal melodies at the same time .
proper nutrition is important for health and functioning , including the prevention of infectious diarrhea . it is especially important to young children who do not have a fully developed immune system . zinc deficiency , a condition often found in children in developing countries can , even in mild cases , have a significant impact on the development and proper functioning of the human immune system . indeed , this relationship between zinc deficiency reduced immune functioning corresponds with an increased severity of infectious diarrhea . children who have lowered levels of zinc have a greater number of instances of diarrhea , severe diarrhea , and diarrhea associated with fever . similarly , vitamin a deficiency can cause an increase in the severity of diarrheal episodes , however there is some discrepancy when it comes to the impact of vitamin a deficiency on the rate of disease . while some argue that a relationship does not exist between the rate of disease and vitamin a status , others suggest an increase in the rate associated with deficiency . given that estimates suggest 127 million preschool children worldwide are vitamin a deficient , this population has the potential for increased risk of disease contraction .
" milliken was perhaps the greatest missed opportunity of that period , " said myron orfield , professor of law at the university of minnesota . " had that gone the other way , it would have opened the door to fixing nearly all of detroit 's current problems . " john mogk , a professor of law and an expert in urban planning at wayne state university in detroit , says , " everybody thinks that it was the riots [ in 1967 ] that caused the white families to leave . some people were leaving at that time but , really , it was after milliken that you saw mass flight to the suburbs . if the case had gone the other way , it is likely that detroit would not have experienced the steep decline in its tax base that has occurred since then . "
alloying a metal is done by combining it with one or more other metals or non-metals that often enhance its properties . for example , steel is stronger than iron , its primary element . the electrical and thermal conductivity of alloys is usually lower than that of the pure metals . the physical properties , such as density , reactivity , young 's modulus of an alloy may not differ greatly from those of its elements , but engineering properties such as tensile strength and shear strength may be substantially different from those of the constituent materials . this is sometimes a result of the sizes of the atoms in the alloy , because larger atoms exert a compressive force on neighboring atoms , and smaller atoms exert a tensile force on their neighbors , helping the alloy resist deformation . sometimes alloys may exhibit marked differences in behavior even when small amounts of one element are present . for example , impurities in semiconducting ferromagnetic alloys lead to different properties , as first predicted by white , hogan , suhl , tian abrie and nakamura . some alloys are made by melting and mixing two or more metals . bronze , an alloy of copper and tin , was the first alloy discovered , during the prehistoric period now known as the bronze age ; it was harder than pure copper and originally used to make tools and weapons , but was later superseded by metals and alloys with better properties . in later times bronze has been used for ornaments , bells , statues , and bearings . brass is an alloy made from copper and zinc .
there were even verdingkinder auctions where children were handed over to the farmer asking the least amount of money from the authorities , thus securing cheap labour for his farm and relieving the authority from the financial burden of looking after the children . in the 1930s 20 % of all agricultural labourers in the canton of bern were children below the age of 15 . swiss municipality guardianship authorities acted so , commonly tolerated by federal authorities , to the 1960s , not all of them of course , but usually communities affected of low taxes in some swiss cantons swiss historian marco leuenberger investigated , that in 1930 there were some 35,000 indentured children , and between 1920 and 1970 more than 100,000 are believed to have been placed with families or homes . 10,000 verdingkinder are still alive . therefore , the so-called wiedergutmachungsinitiative was started in april 2014 . in april 2014 the collection of targeted at least authenticated 100,000 signatures of swiss citizens has started , and still have to be collected to october 2015 .
in iran ( persia ) , the history of cotton dates back to the achaemenid era ( 5th century bc ) ; however , there are few sources about the planting of cotton in pre-islamic iran . the planting of cotton was common in merv , ray and pars of iran . in persian poets ' poems , especially ferdowsi 's shahname , there are references to cotton ( " panbe " in persian ) . marco polo ( 13th century ) refers to the major products of persia , including cotton . john chardin , a french traveler of the 17th century who visited the safavid persia , spoke approvingly of the vast cotton farms of persia .
in september 2008 , the crisis hit its most critical stage . there was the equivalent of a bank run on the money market funds , which frequently invest in commercial paper issued by corporations to fund their operations and payrolls . withdrawal from money markets were $ 144.5 billion during one week , versus $ 7.1 billion the week prior . this interrupted the ability of corporations to rollover ( replace ) their short-term debt . the u.s. government responded by extending insurance for money market accounts analogous to bank deposit insurance via a temporary guarantee and with federal reserve programs to purchase commercial paper . the ted spread , an indicator of perceived credit risk in the general economy , spiked up in july 2007 , remained volatile for a year , then spiked even higher in september 2008 , reaching a record 4.65 % on october 10 , 2008 .
there is also a range of independent or public schools . many of these are for pupils between 11 and 18 years , such as king 's college , taunton and taunton school . king 's school , bruton , was founded in 1519 and received royal foundation status around 30 years later in the reign of edward vi . millfield is the largest co-educational boarding school . there are also preparatory schools for younger children , such as all hallows , and hazlegrove preparatory school . chilton cantelo school offers places both to day pupils and boarders aged 7 to 16 . other schools provide education for children from the age of 3 or 4 years through to 18 , such as king edward 's school , bath , queen 's college , taunton and wells cathedral school which is one of the five established musical schools for school-age children in britain . some of these schools have religious affiliations , such as monkton combe school , prior park college , sidcot school which is associated with the religious society of friends , downside school which is a roman catholic public school in stratton-on-the-fosse , situated next to the benedictine downside abbey , and kingswood school , which was founded by john wesley in 1748 in kingswood near bristol , originally for the education of the sons of the itinerant ministers ( clergy ) of the methodist church .
isambard kingdom brunel , the british engineer and railway builder , introduced the idea of a circular bar into the swindon station pub in order that customers were served quickly and did not delay his trains . these island bars became popular as they also allowed staff to serve customers in several different rooms surrounding the bar .
the czechs ' language separated from other slavic tongues into what would later be called old czech by the thirteenth century , a classification extending through the sixteenth century . its use of cases differed from the modern language ; although old czech did not yet have a vocative case or an animacy distinction , declension for its six cases and three genders rapidly became complicated ( partially to differentiate homophones ) and its declension patterns resembled those of lithuanian ( its balto-slavic cousin ) .
the house which forms the architectural core of the palace was built for the first duke of buckingham and normanby in 1703 to the design of william winde . the style chosen was of a large , three-floored central block with two smaller flanking service wings . buckingham house was eventually sold by buckingham 's descendant , sir charles sheffield , in 1761 to george iii for £ 21,000 . sheffield 's leasehold on the mulberry garden site , the freehold of which was still owned by the royal family , was due to expire in 1774 .
to prevent the risk of out-of-phase supplies mixing , sections of line fed from different feeder stations must be kept strictly isolated . this is achieved by neutral sections ( also known as phase breaks ) , usually provided at feeder stations and midway between them although , typically , only half are in use at any time , the others being provided to allow a feeder station to be shut down and power provided from adjacent feeder stations . neutral sections usually consist of an earthed section of wire which is separated from the live wires on either side by insulating material , typically ceramic beads , designed so that the pantograph will smoothly run from one section to the other . the earthed section prevents an arc being drawn from one live section to the other , as the voltage difference may be higher than the normal system voltage if the live sections are on different phases and the protective circuit breakers may not be able to safely interrupt the considerable current that would flow . to prevent the risk of an arc being drawn across from one section of wire to earth , when passing through the neutral section , the train must be coasting and the circuit breakers must be open . in many cases , this is done manually by the drivers . to help them , a warning board is provided just before both the neutral section and an advance warning some distance before . a further board is then provided after the neutral section to tell drivers to re-close the circuit breaker , although drivers must not do this until the rear pantograph has passed this board . in the uk , a system known as automatic power control ( apc ) automatically opens and closes the circuit breaker , this being achieved by using sets of permanent magnets alongside the track communicating with a detector on the train . the only action needed by the driver is to shut off power and coast and therefore warning boards are still provided at and on the approach to neutral sections .
there are many non-incandescent light sources , such as the fluorescent lamp , high-intensity discharge lamps and led lamps , which have higher luminous efficiency , and some have been designed to be retrofitted in fixtures for incandescent lights . these devices produce light by luminescence . these lamps produce discrete spectral lines and do not have the broad " tail " of invisible infrared emissions . by careful selection of which electron energy level transitions are used , and fluorescent coatings which modify the spectral distribution , the spectrum emitted can be tuned to mimic the appearance of incandescent sources , or other different color temperatures of white light . due to the discrete spectral lines rather than a continuous spectrum , the light is not ideal for applications such as photography and cinematography .
the 2008 summer olympics torch relay was run from march 24 until august 8 , 2008 , prior to the 2008 summer olympics , with the theme of " one world , one dream . " plans for the relay were announced on april 26 , 2007 , in beijing , china . the relay , also called by the organizers as the " journey of harmony , " lasted 129 days and carried the torch 137,000 km ( 85,000 mi ) - the longest distance of any olympic torch relay since the tradition was started ahead of the 1936 summer olympics .
gaddafi briefly studied history at the university of libya in benghazi , before dropping out to join the military . despite his police record , in 1963 he began training at the royal military academy , benghazi , alongside several like-minded friends from misrata . the armed forces offered the only opportunity for upward social mobility for underprivileged libyans , and gaddafi recognised it as a potential instrument of political change . under idris , libya 's armed forces were trained by the british military ; this angered gaddafi , who viewed the british as imperialists , and accordingly he refused to learn english and was rude to the british officers , ultimately failing his exams . british trainers reported him for insubordination and abusive behaviour , stating their suspicion that he was involved in the assassination of the military academy 's commander in 1963 . such reports were ignored and gaddafi quickly progressed through the course .
in september 2006 , the itunes store began to offer additional games for purchase with the launch of itunes 7 , compatible with the fifth generation ipod with ipod software 1.2 or later . those games were : bejeweled , cubis 2 , mahjong , mini golf , pac-man , tetris , texas hold ' em , vortex , asphalt 4 : elite racing and zuma . additional games have since been added . these games work on the 6th and 5th generation ipod classic and the 5th and 4th generation ipod nano .
these deities formed a core pantheon ; there were additionally hundreds of minor ones . sumerian gods could thus have associations with different cities , and their religious importance often waxed and waned with those cities ' political power . the gods were said to have created human beings from clay for the purpose of serving them . the temples organized the mass labour projects needed for irrigation agriculture . citizens had a labor duty to the temple , though they could avoid it by a payment of silver .
the coats of domestic dogs are of two varieties : " double " being common with dogs ( as well as wolves ) originating from colder climates , made up of a coarse guard hair and a soft down hair , or " single , " with the topcoat only .
however , early christian writers who speak of the shape of the particular gibbet on which jesus died invariably describe it as having a cross-beam . for instance , the epistle of barnabas , which was certainly earlier than 135 , and may have been of the 1st century ad , the time when the gospel accounts of the death of jesus were written , likened it to the letter t ( the greek letter tau , which had the numeric value of 300 ) , and to the position assumed by moses in exodus 17 : 11-12 . justin martyr ( 100-165 ) explicitly says the cross of christ was of two-beam shape : " that lamb which was commanded to be wholly roasted was a symbol of the suffering of the cross which christ would undergo . for the lamb , which is roasted , is roasted and dressed up in the form of the cross . for one spit is transfixed right through from the lower parts up to the head , and one across the back , to which are attached the legs of the lamb . " irenaeus , who died around the end of the 2nd century , speaks of the cross as having " five extremities , two in length , two in breadth , and one in the middle , on which [ last ] the person rests who is fixed by the nails . "
the single most important piece of byzantine christian mosaic art in the east is the madaba map , made between 542 and 570 as the floor of the church of saint george at madaba , jordan . it was rediscovered in 1894 . the madaba map is the oldest surviving cartographic depiction of the holy land . it depicts an area from lebanon in the north to the nile delta in the south , and from the mediterranean sea in the west to the eastern desert . the largest and most detailed element of the topographic depiction is jerusalem , at the center of the map . the map is enriched with many naturalistic features , like animals , fishing boats , bridges and palm trees
in mexico , carnival is celebrated in about 225 cities and towns . the largest is in mazatlan and the city of veracruz with others in baja california and yucatan . the larger city carnivals employ costumes , elected queens and parades with floats , but carnival celebrations in smaller and rural areas vary widely depending on the level of european influence during mexico 's colonial period . the largest of these is in huejotzingo , puebla where most townspeople take part in mock combat with rifles shooting blanks , roughly based on the battle of puebla . other important states with local traditions include morelos , oaxaca , tlaxcala and chiapas .
new zealand polytechnics are established under the education act 1989 as amended , and are considered state-owned tertiary institutions along with universities , colleges of education , and wananga ; there is today often much crossover in courses and qualifications offered between all these types of tertiary education institutions . some have officially taken the title ' institute of technology ' which is a term recognized in government strategies equal to that of the term ' polytechnic ' . one has opted for the name ' universal college of learning ' ( ucol ) , and another ' unitec new zealand ' . these are legal names but not recognized terms like ' polytechnic ' or ' institute of technology ' . many if not all now grant at least bachelor-level degrees .
on 14 july , iraqi army officers abdel karim qasim and abdel salam aref overthrew the iraqi monarchy and , the next day , iraqi prime minister and nasser 's chief arab antagonist , nuri al-said , was killed . nasser recognized the new government and stated that " any attack on iraq was tantamount to an attack on the uar . " on 15 july , us marines landed in lebanon , and british special forces in jordan , upon the request of those countries ' governments to prevent them from falling to pro-nasser forces . nasser felt that the revolution in iraq left the road for pan-arab unity unblocked . on 19 july , for the first time , he declared that he was opting for full arab union , although he had no plan to merge iraq with the uar . while most members of the iraqi revolutionary command council ( rcc ) favored iraqi-uar unity , qasim sought to keep iraq independent and resented nasser 's large popular base in the country .
after world war i the us army started developing a dual-role ( aa / ground ) automatic 37 mm cannon , designed by john m. browning . it was standardised in 1927 as the t9 aa cannon , but trials quickly revealed that it was worthless in the ground role . however , while the shell was a bit light ( well under 2 lbs ) it had a good effective ceiling and fired 125 rounds per minute ; an aa carriage was developed and it entered service in 1939 . the browning 37mm proved prone to jamming , and was eventually replaced in aa units by the bofors 40 mm . the bofors had attracted attention from the us navy , but none were acquired before 1939 . also , in 1931 the us army worked on a mobile anti-aircraft machine mount on the back of a heavy truck having four .30 caliber water-cooled machine guns and an optical director . it proved unsuccessful and was abandoned .
salts of many oxidation states of uranium are water-soluble and may be studied in aqueous solutions . the most common ionic forms are u3 + ( brown-red ) , u4 + ( green ) , uo +2 ( unstable ) , and uo2 +2 ( yellow ) , for u ( iii ) , u ( iv ) , u ( v ) , and u ( vi ) , respectively . a few solid and semi-metallic compounds such as uo and us exist for the formal oxidation state uranium ( ii ) , but no simple ions are known to exist in solution for that state . ions of u3 + liberate hydrogen from water and are therefore considered to be highly unstable . the uo2 +2 ion represents the uranium ( vi ) state and is known to form compounds such as uranyl carbonate , uranyl chloride and uranyl sulfate . uo2 +2 also forms complexes with various organic chelating agents , the most commonly encountered of which is uranyl acetate .
on 7 january 2015 , two french muslim extremists attacked the paris headquarters of charlie hebdo and killed thirteen people , and on 9 january , a third terrorist killed four hostages during an attack at a jewish grocery store at porte de vincennes . on 11 january an estimated 1.5 million people marched in paris-along with international political leaders-to show solidarity against terrorism and in defence of freedom of speech . ten months later , 13 november 2015 , came a series of coordinated terrorist attacks in paris and saint-denis claimed by the ' islamic state ' organisation isil ( ' daesh ' , isis ) ; 130 people were killed by gunfire and bombs , and more than 350 were injured . seven of the attackers killed themselves and others by setting off their explosive vests . on the morning of 18 november three suspected terrorists , including alleged planner of the attacks abdelhamid abaaoud , were killed in a shootout with police in the paris suburb of saint-denis . president hollande declared france to be in a three-month state of emergency .
chopin 's mazurkas and waltzes are all in straightforward ternary or episodic form , sometimes with a coda . the mazurkas often show more folk features than many of his other works , sometimes including modal scales and harmonies and the use of drone basses . however , some also show unusual sophistication , for example op. 63 no. 3 , which includes a canon at one beat 's distance , a great rarity in music .
the alps are split into five climatic zones , each with different vegetation . the climate , plant life and animal life vary among the different sections or zones of the mountains . the lowest zone is the colline zone , which exists between 500 and 1,000 m ( 1,640 and 3,281 ft ) , depending on the location . the montane zone extends from 800 to 1,700 m ( 2,625 to 5,577 ft ) , followed by the sub-alpine zone from 1,600 to 2,400 m ( 5,249 to 7,874 ft ) . the alpine zone , extending from tree line to snow line , is followed by the glacial zone , which covers the glaciated areas of the mountain . climatic conditions show variances within the same zones ; for example , weather conditions at the head of a mountain valley , extending directly from the peaks , are colder and more severe than those at the mouth of a valley which tend to be less severe and receive less snowfall .
in november 1844 , the anonymously published popular science book vestiges of the natural history of creation , written by scottish journalist robert chambers , widened public interest in the concept of transmutation of species . vestiges used evidence from the fossil record and embryology to support the claim that living things had progressed from the simple to the more complex over time . but it proposed a linear progression rather than the branching common descent theory behind darwin 's work in progress , and it ignored adaptation . darwin read it soon after publication , and scorned its amateurish geology and zoology , but he carefully reviewed his own arguments after leading scientists , including adam sedgwick , attacked its morality and scientific errors . vestiges had significant influence on public opinion , and the intense debate helped to pave the way for the acceptance of the more scientifically sophisticated origin by moving evolutionary speculation into the mainstream . while few naturalists were willing to consider transmutation , herbert spencer became an active proponent of lamarckism and progressive development in the 1850s .
with egypt and macedonia weakened , the seleucid empire made increasingly aggressive and successful attempts to conquer the entire greek world . now not only rome 's allies against philip , but even philip himself , sought a roman alliance against the seleucids . the situation was made worse by the fact that hannibal was now a chief military advisor to the seleucid emperor , and the two were believed to be planning an outright conquest not just of greece , but of rome itself . the seleucids were much stronger than the macedonians had ever been , because they controlled much of the former persian empire , and by now had almost entirely reassembled alexander the great 's former empire .
many aspects of roman culture were borrowed from the greeks . in architecture and sculpture , the difference between greek models and roman paintings are apparent . the chief roman contributions to architecture were the arch and the dome . rome has also had a tremendous impact on european cultures following it . its significance is perhaps best reflected in its endurance and influence , as is seen in the longevity and lasting importance of works of virgil and ovid . latin , the republic 's primary language , remains used for liturgical purposes by the roman catholic church , and up to the 19th century was used extensively in scholarly writings in , for example , science and mathematics . roman law laid the foundations for the laws of many european countries and their colonies .

the country currency is the samoan tala , issued and regulated by the central bank of samoa . the economy of samoa has traditionally been dependent on agriculture and fishing at the local level . in modern times , development aid , private family remittances from overseas , and agricultural exports have become key factors in the nation 's economy . agriculture employs two-thirds of the labour force , and furnishes 90 % of exports , featuring coconut cream , coconut oil , noni ( juice of the nonu fruit , as it is known in samoan ) , and copra .
research since reveals self-examination beginning early in adolescence , but identity achievement rarely occurring before age 18 . the freshman year of college influences identity development significantly , but may actually prolong psychosocial moratorium by encouraging reexamination of previous commitments and further exploration of alternate possibilities without encouraging resolution . for the most part , evidence has supported erikson 's stages : each correlates with the personality traits he originally predicted . studies also confirm the impermanence of the stages ; there is no final endpoint in identity development .
in the 20th century , russian was mandatorily taught in the schools of the members of the old warsaw pact and in other countries that used to be satellites of the ussr . in particular , these countries include poland , bulgaria , the czech republic , slovakia , hungary , albania , former east germany and cuba . however , younger generations are usually not fluent in it , because russian is no longer mandatory in the school system . according to the eurobarometer 2005 survey , though , fluency in russian remains fairly high ( 20-40 % ) in some countries , in particular those where the people speak a slavic language and thereby have an edge in learning russian ( namely , poland , czech republic , slovakia , and bulgaria ) .
in politics , corruption undermines democracy and good governance by flouting or even subverting formal processes . corruption in elections and in the legislature reduces accountability and distorts representation in policymaking ; corruption in the judiciary compromises the rule of law ; and corruption in public administration results in the inefficient provision of services . it violates a basic principle of republicanism regarding the centrality of civic virtue .
brazilian census data ( pnad , 1999 ) indicate that 2.55 million 10-14 year-olds were illegally holding jobs . they were joined by 3.7 million 15-17 year-olds and about 375,000 5-9 year-olds . due to the raised age restriction of 14 , at least half of the recorded young workers had been employed illegally which lead to many not being protect by important labour laws . although substantial time has passed since the time of regulated child labour , there is still a large number of children working illegally in brazil . many children are used by drug cartels to sell and carry drugs , guns , and other illegal substances because of their perception of innocence . this type of work that youth are taking part in is very dangerous due to the physical and psychological implications that come with these jobs . yet despite the hazards that come with working with drug dealers , there has been an increase in this area of employment throughout the country .
from the league 's inception through arenabowl xviii , the championship game was played at the home of the highest-seeded remaining team . the afl then switched to a neutral-site championship , with arenabowls xix and xx in las vegas . new orleans arena , home of the new orleans voodoo , served as the site of arenabowl xxi on july 29 , 2007 . this was the first professional sports championship to be staged in the city since hurricane katrina struck in august 2005 . the san jose sabercats earned their third championship in six years by defeating the columbus destroyers 55-33 . arenabowl xxi in new orleans was deemed a success , and the city was chosen to host arenabowl xxii , in which the philadelphia soul defeated the defending champion san jose sabercats . in 2010 , the location returned to being decided by which of the two participating teams was seeded higher . in arenabowl xxiii , the spokane shock defeated the tampa bay storm at their home arena , spokane arena , in spokane , washington . in arenabowl xxiv , the jacksonville sharks , coming off of a victory in their conference final game four nights earlier , traveled to us airways center in phoenix and defeated the arizona rattlers 73-70 . arenabowl xxv returned to a neutral site and was once again played in new orleans , where the rattlers returned and defeated the philadelphia soul . since 2014 the arenabowl has been played at the higher-seeded team .
in september 1695 , captain henry every , an english pirate on board the fancy , reached the straits of bab-el-mandeb , where he teamed up with five other pirate captains to make an attack on the indian fleet making the annual voyage to mocha . the mughal convoy included the treasure-laden ganj-i-sawai , reported to be the greatest in the mughal fleet and the largest ship operational in the indian ocean , and its escort , the fateh muhammed . they were spotted passing the straits en route to surat . the pirates gave chase and caught up with fateh muhammed some days later , and meeting little resistance , took some £ 50,000 to £ 60,000 worth of treasure .
the second main principle , sola fide ( by faith alone ) , states that faith in christ is sufficient alone for eternal salvation . though argued from scripture , and hence logically consequent to sola scriptura , this is the guiding principle of the work of luther and the later reformers . because sola scriptura placed the bible as the only source of teaching , sola fide epitomises the main thrust of the teaching the reformers wanted to get back to , namely the direct , close , personal connection between christ and the believer , hence the reformers ' contention that their work was christocentric .
at the end of the late middle ages , professional actors began to appear in england and europe . richard iii and henry vii both maintained small companies of professional actors . their plays were performed in the great hall of a nobleman 's residence , often with a raised platform at one end for the audience and a " screen " at the other for the actors . also important were mummers ' plays , performed during the christmas season , and court masques . these masques were especially popular during the reign of henry viii who had a house of revels built and an office of revels established in 1545 .
they maintained that the potassium tartrate used in his treatment prevented his stomach from expelling these compounds and that his thirst was a symptom of the poison . their hypothesis was that the calomel given to napoleon became an overdose , which killed him and left extensive tissue damage behind . according to a 2007 article , the type of arsenic found in napoleon 's hair shafts was mineral , the most toxic , and according to toxicologist patrick kintz , this supported the conclusion that he was murdered .
the taragaon museum presents the modern history of the kathmandu valley . it seeks to document 50 years of research and cultural heritage conservation of the kathmandu valley , documenting what artists photographers architects anthropologists from abroad had contributed in the second half of the 20th century . the actual structure of the museum showcases restoration and rehabilitation efforts to preserve the built heritage of kathmandu . it was designed by carl pruscha ( master-planner of the kathmandy valley ) in 1970 and constructed in 1971 . restoration works began in 2010 to rehabilitate the taragaon hostel into the taragaon museum . the design uses local brick along with modern architectural design elements , as well as the use of circle , triangles and squares . the museum is within a short walk from the boudhnath stupa , which itself can be seen from the museum tower .

noted 19th-century mosaics include those by edward burne-jones at st pauls within the walls in rome . another modern mosaic of note is the world 's largest mosaic installation located at the cathedral basilica of st. louis , located in st. louis , missouri . a modern example of mosaic is the museum of natural history station of the new york city subway ( there are many such works of art scattered throughout the new york city subway system , though many ind stations are usually designed with bland mosaics . ) another example of mosaics in ordinary surroundings is the use of locally themed mosaics in some restrooms in the rest areas along some texas interstate highways .
a latin translation of ibn tufail 's work , philosophus autodidactus , first appeared in 1671 , prepared by edward pococke the younger , followed by an english translation by simon ockley in 1708 , as well as german and dutch translations . these translations might have later inspired daniel defoe to write robinson crusoe , regarded as the first novel in english . philosophus autodidactus , continuing the thoughts of philosophers such as aristotle from earlier ages , inspired robert boyle to write his own philosophical novel set on an island , the aspiring naturalist .
in many ancient civilizations , such as those of egypt and mesopotamia , architecture and urbanism reflected the constant engagement with the divine and the supernatural , and many ancient cultures resorted to monumentality in architecture to represent symbolically the political power of the ruler , the ruling elite , or the state itself .
an earlier draft of to kill a mockingbird , titled go set a watchman , was controversially released on july 14 , 2015 . this draft , which was completed in 1957 , is set 20 years after the time period depicted in to kill a mockingbird but is not a continuation of the narrative . this earlier version of the story follows an adult scout finch who travels from new york to visit her father , atticus finch , in maycomb , alabama , where she is confronted by the intolerance in her community . the watchman manuscript was believed to have been lost until lee 's lawyer tonja carter discovered it ; although this claim has been widely disputed . watchman contains early versions of many of the characters from to kill a mockingbird . according to lee 's agent andrew nurnberg , mockingbird was originally intended to be the first book of a trilogy : " they discussed publishing mockingbird first , watchman last , and a shorter connecting novel between the two . " this assertion has been discredited however by the rare books expert james s. jaffe , who reviewed the pages at the request of lee 's attorney and found them to be only another draft of " to kill a mockingbird . " the statement was also contrary to jonathan mahler 's description of how " watchman " was seen as just the first draft of " mockingbird . " instances where many passages overlap between the two books , in some case word for word , also refutes this assertion .
alongside barre , the supreme revolutionary council ( src ) that assumed power after president sharmarke 's assassination was led by lieutenant colonel salaad gabeyre kediye and chief of police jama korshel . the src subsequently renamed the country the somali democratic republic , dissolved the parliament and the supreme court , and suspended the constitution .
many kinds of clothing are designed to be ironed before they are worn to remove wrinkles . most modern formal and semi-formal clothing is in this category ( for example , dress shirts and suits ) . ironed clothes are believed to look clean , fresh , and neat . much contemporary casual clothing is made of knit materials that do not readily wrinkle , and do not require ironing . some clothing is permanent press , having been treated with a coating ( such as polytetrafluoroethylene ) that suppresses wrinkles and creates a smooth appearance without ironing .
according to author michael carrithers , while there are good reasons to doubt the traditional account , " the outline of the life must be true : birth , maturity , renunciation , search , awakening and liberation , teaching , death . " in writing her biography of the buddha , karen armstrong noted , " it is obviously difficult , therefore , to write a biography of the buddha that meets modern criteria , because we have very little information that can be considered historically sound ... [ but ] we can be reasonably confident siddhatta gotama did indeed exist and that his disciples preserved the memory of his life and teachings as well as they could . " [ dubious - discuss ]
bush and kerry met for the third and final debate at arizona state university on october 13 . 51 million viewers watched the debate which was moderated by bob schieffer of cbs news . however , at the time of the asu debate , there were 15.2 million viewers tuned in to watch the major league baseball playoffs broadcast simultaneously . after kerry , responding to a question about gay rights , reminded the audience that vice president cheney 's daughter was a lesbian , cheney responded with a statement calling himself " a pretty angry father " due to kerry using cheney 's daughter 's sexual orientation for his political purposes .
rca 45s were also adapted to the smaller spindle of an lp player with a plastic snap-in insert known as a " spider . " these inserts , commissioned by rca president david sarnoff and invented by thomas hutchison , were prevalent starting in the 1960s , selling in the tens of millions per year during the 45 rpm heyday . in countries outside the u.s. , 45s often had the smaller album-sized holes , e.g. , australia and new zealand , or as in the united kingdom , especially before the 1970s , the disc had a small hole within a circular central section held only by three or four lands so that it could be easily punched out if desired ( typically for use in jukeboxes ) .
terry eastland , the author who wrote from ending affirmative action : the case for colorblind justice states , " most arguments for affirmative action fall into two categories : remedying past discrimination and promoting diversity . " eastland believes that the founders of affirmative action did not anticipate how the benefits of affirmative action would go to those who did not need it , mostly middle class minorities . additionally , she argues that affirmative action carries with it a stigma that can create feelings of self-doubt and entitlement in minorities . eastland believes that affirmative action is a great risk that only sometimes pays off , and that without it we would be able to compete more freely with one another . libertarian economist thomas sowell identified what he says are negative results of affirmative action in his book , affirmative action around the world : an empirical study . sowell writes that affirmative action policies encourage non-preferred groups to designate themselves as members of preferred groups [ i.e. , primary beneficiaries of affirmative action ] to take advantage of group preference policies ; that they tend to benefit primarily the most fortunate among the preferred group ( e.g. , upper and middle class blacks ) , often to the detriment of the least fortunate among the non-preferred groups ( e.g. , poor white or asian ) ; that they reduce the incentives of both the preferred and non-preferred to perform at their best - the former because doing so is unnecessary and the latter because it can prove futile - thereby resulting in net losses for society as a whole ; and that they engender animosity toward preferred groups as well . : 115-147
federalism , and other forms of territorially autonomy , is generally seen as a useful way to structure political systems in order prevent violence among different groups with countries because it allows certain groups to legislate at the subnational level . some scholars have suggested , however , that federalism can divide countries and result in state collapse because it creates proto-states . still others have shown that federalism is only divisive when it lacks mechanisms tthat encourage political parties to compete across regional boundaries .
during encoding , 576 time-domain samples are taken and are transformed to 576 frequency-domain samples . [ clarification needed ] if there is a transient , 192 samples are taken instead of 576 . this is done to limit the temporal spread of quantization noise accompanying the transient .

in 1790 , the first federal population census was taken in the united states . enumerators were instructed to classify free residents as white or " other . " only the heads of households were identified by name in the federal census until 1850 . native americans were included among " other ; " in later censuses , they were included as " free people of color " if they were not living on indian reservations . slaves were counted separately from free persons in all the censuses until the civil war and end of slavery . in later censuses , people of african descent were classified by appearance as mulatto ( which recognized visible european ancestry in addition to african ) or black .

in its 2013 parkscore ranking , the trust for public land reported that the park system in new york city was the second best park system among the 50 most populous u.s. cities , behind the park system of minneapolis . parkscore ranks urban park systems by a formula that analyzes median park size , park acres as percent of city area , the percent of city residents within a half-mile of a park , spending of park services per resident , and the number of playgrounds per 10,000 residents .
greater london 's population declined steadily in the decades after the second world war , from an estimated peak of 8.6 million in 1939 to around 6.8 million in the 1980s . the principal ports for london moved downstream to felixstowe and tilbury , with the london docklands area becoming a focus for regeneration , including the canary wharf development . this was borne out of london 's ever-increasing role as a major international financial centre during the 1980s . the thames barrier was completed in the 1980s to protect london against tidal surges from the north sea .
during the hundred years ' war , the army of the duke of burgundy and a force of about two hundred english soldiers occupied paris from may 1420 until 1436 . they repelled an attempt by joan of arc to liberate the city in 1429 . a century later , during the french wars of religion , paris was a stronghold of the catholic league . on 24 august 1572 , paris was the site of the st. bartholomew 's day massacre , when thousands of french protestants were killed . the last of these wars , the eighth one , ended in 1594 , after henri iv had converted to catholicism and was finally able to enter paris as he supposedly declared paris vaut bien une messe ( " paris is well worth a mass " ) . the city had been neglected for decades ; by the time of his assassination in 1610 , henry iv had rebuilt the pont neuf , the first paris bridge with sidewalks and not lined with buildings , linked with a new wing the louvre to the tuileries palace , and created the first paris residential square , the place royale , now place des vosges .

all states have a geographic scope of interests , actions , or projected power . this is a crucial factor in distinguishing a great power from a regional power ; by definition the scope of a regional power is restricted to its region . it has been suggested that a great power should be possessed of actual influence throughout the scope of the prevailing international system . arnold j. toynbee , for example , observes that " great power may be defined as a political force exerting an effect co-extensive with the widest range of the society in which it operates . the great powers of 1914 were ' world-powers ' because western society had recently become ' world-wide ' . "
the main mode of transportation , however , relies on seattle 's streets , which are laid out in a cardinal directions grid pattern , except in the central business district where early city leaders arthur denny and carson boren insisted on orienting their plats relative to the shoreline rather than to true north . only two roads , interstate 5 and state route 99 ( both limited-access highways ) , run uninterrupted through the city from north to south . state route 99 runs through downtown seattle on the alaskan way viaduct , which was built in 1953 . however , due to damage sustained during the 2001 nisqually earthquake the viaduct will be replaced by a tunnel . the 2-mile ( 3.2 km ) alaskan way viaduct replacement tunnel was originally scheduled to be completed in december 2015 at a cost of us $ 4.25 billion . unfortunately , due to issues with the worlds largest tunnel boring machine ( tbm ) , which is nicknamed " bertha " and is 57 feet ( 17 m ) in diameter , the projected date of completion has been pushed back to 2017 . seattle has the 8th worst traffic congestion of all american cities , and is 10th among all north american cities .
shias believe that imamah is of the principles of faith ( usul al-din ) .as the verse 4 : 165 of quran expresses the necessity to the appointment of the prophets ; so after the demise of the prophet who will play the role of the prophet ; till the people have not any plea against allah.so the same logic that necessitated the assignment of prophets also is applied for imamah.that is allah must assign someone similar to prophet in his attributes and ismah as his successor to guide the people without any deviation in religion . they refer to the verse ( ... this day i have perfected for you your religion and completed my favor upon you and have approved for you islam as religion ... ) 5 : 3 of quran which was revealed to the prophet when he appointed ali as his successor at the day of ghadir khumm .
bush focused his campaign on national security , presenting himself as a decisive leader and contrasted kerry as a " flip-flopper . " this strategy was designed to convey to american voters the idea that bush could be trusted to be tough on terrorism while kerry would be " uncertain in the face of danger . " bush ( just as his father did with dukakis in the 1988 election ) also sought to portray kerry as a " massachusetts liberal " who was out of touch with mainstream americans . one of kerry 's slogans was " stronger at home , respected in the world . " this advanced the suggestion that kerry would pay more attention to domestic concerns ; it also encapsulated kerry 's contention that bush had alienated american allies by his foreign policy .

with japanese and allied forces occupying various parts of the island , over the following six months both sides poured resources into an escalating battle of attrition on land , at sea , and in the sky . most of the japanese aircraft based in the south pacific were redeployed to the defense of guadalcanal . many were lost in numerous engagements with the allied air forces based at henderson field as well as carrier based aircraft . meanwhile , japanese ground forces launched repeated attacks on heavily defended us positions around henderson field , in which they suffered appalling casualties . to sustain these offensives , resupply was carried out by japanese convoys , termed the " tokyo express " by the allies . the convoys often faced night battles with enemy naval forces in which they expended destroyers that the ijn could ill-afford to lose . later fleet battles involving heavier ships and even daytime carrier battles resulted in a stretch of water near guadalcanal becoming known as " ironbottom sound " from the multitude of ships sunk on both sides . however , the allies were much better able to replace these losses . finally recognizing that the campaign to recapture henderson field and secure guadalcanal had simply become too costly to continue , the japanese evacuated the island and withdrew in february 1943 . in the sixth month war of attrition , the japanese had lost as a result of failing to commit enough forces in sufficient time .
nasser 's involvement in political activity increased throughout his school years , such that he only attended 45 days of classes during his last year of secondary school . despite it having the almost unanimous backing of egypt 's political forces , nasser strongly objected to the 1936 anglo-egyptian treaty because it stipulated the continued presence of british military bases in the country . nonetheless , political unrest in egypt declined significantly and nasser resumed his studies at al-nahda , where he received his leaving certificate later that year .

these processes are also important in biological responses to pollution ; for example , sulfate-reducing bacteria are largely responsible for the production of the highly toxic forms of mercury ( methyl- and dimethylmercury ) in the environment . non-respiratory anaerobes use fermentation to generate energy and reducing power , secreting metabolic by-products ( such as ethanol in brewing ) as waste . facultative anaerobes can switch between fermentation and different terminal electron acceptors depending on the environmental conditions in which they find themselves .
in response to the publication of the secret protocols and other secret german-soviet relations documents in the state department edition nazi-soviet relations ( 1948 ) , stalin published falsifiers of history , which included the claim that , during the pact 's operation , stalin rejected hitler 's claim to share in a division of the world , without mentioning the soviet offer to join the axis . that version persisted , without exception , in historical studies , official accounts , memoirs and textbooks published in the soviet union until the soviet union 's dissolution .
japan : the event was held in nagano , which hosted the 1998 winter olympics , on april 26 . japanese buddhist temple zenko-ji , which was originally scheduled to be the starting point for the olympic torch relay in nagano , refused to host the torch and pulled out of the relay plans , amid speculation that monks there sympathized with anti-chinese government protesters. as well as the risk of disruption by violent protests . parts of zenko-ji temple 's main building ( zenko-ji hondo ) , reconstructed in 1707 and one of the national treasures of japan , was then vandalized with spraypaint . a new starting point , previously the site of a municipal building and now a parking lot , was chosen by the city . an event the city had planned to hold at the minami nagano sports park following the torch relay was also canceled out of concern about disruptions caused by demonstrators protesting against china 's recent crackdown in tibet . thousands of riot police were mobilized to protect the torch along its route . the show of force kept most protesters in check , but slogans shouted by pro-china or pro-tibet demonstrators , japanese nationalists , and human rights organizations flooded the air . five men were arrested and four injured amidst scenes of mob violence . the torch route was packed with mostly peaceful demonstrators . the public was not allowed at the parking lot where the relay started . after the zenkoji monks held a prayer ceremony for victims of the recent events in tibet . more than 100 police officers ran with the torch and riot police lined the streets while three helicopters flew above . only two chinese guards were allowed to accompany the torch because of japan 's concern over their treatment of demonstrators at previous relays . a man with a tibetan flag tried to stop the torch at the beginning of the relay but was dragged off by police . some raw eggs were also thrown from the crowd .

in the 1930s , the experimental station w3xe , owned by philco , became the first television station in philadelphia ; it became nbc 's first affiliate in 1939 , and later became kyw-tv ( cbs ) . wcau-tv , wpvi-tv , whyy-tv , wphl-tv , and wtxf-tv had all been founded by the 1970s . in 1952 , wfil ( now wpvi ) premiered the television show bandstand , which later became the nationally broadcast american bandstand hosted by dick clark . today , as in many large metropolitan areas , each of the commercial networks has an affiliate , and call letters have been replaced by corporate ids : cbs3 , 6abc , nbc10 , fox29 , telefutura28 , telemundo62 , univision65 , plus my phl 17 and cw philly 57 . the region is served also by public broadcasting stations wybe-tv ( philadelphia ) , whyy-tv ( wilmington , delaware and philadelphia ) , wlvt-tv ( lehigh valley ) , and njtv ( new jersey ) . in september 2007 , philadelphia approved a public-access television cable tv channel .
galicia was late to catch the tourism boom that has swept spain in recent decades , but the coastal regions ( especially the rias baixas and santiago de compostela ) are now significant tourist destinations and are especially popular with visitors from other regions in spain , where the majority of tourists come from . in 2007 , 5.7 million tourists visited galicia , an 8 % growth over the previous year , and part of a continual pattern of growth in this sector . 85 % of tourists who visit galicia visit santiago de compostela . tourism constitutes 12 % of galician gdp and employs about 12 % of the regional workforce .
in june 2005 , presidential elections were held for the first time since the coup that deposed iala . iala returned as the candidate for the prs , claiming to be the legitimate president of the country , but the election was won by former president joao bernardo vieira , deposed in the 1999 coup . vieira beat malam bacai sanha in a runoff election . sanha initially refused to concede , claiming that tampering and electoral fraud occurred in two constituencies including the capital , bissau .
their first ever defeat on home soil to a foreign team was an 0-2 loss to the republic of ireland , on 21 september 1949 at goodison park . a 6-3 loss in 1953 to hungary , was their second defeat by a foreign team at wembley . in the return match in budapest , hungary won 7-1 . this still stands as england 's worst ever defeat . after the game , a bewildered syd owen said , " it was like playing men from outer space . " in the 1954 fifa world cup , england reached the quarter-finals for the first time , and lost 4-2 to reigning champions uruguay .

on 2 july 2012 , glaxosmithkline pleaded guilty to criminal charges and agreed to a $ 3 billion settlement of the largest health-care fraud case in the u.s. and the largest payment by a drug company . the settlement is related to the company 's illegal promotion of prescription drugs , its failure to report safety data , bribing doctors , and promoting medicines for uses for which they were not licensed . the drugs involved were paxil , wellbutrin , advair , lamictal , and zofran for off-label , non-covered uses . those and the drugs imitrex , lotronex , flovent , and valtrex were involved in the kickback scheme .
archaeologists excavating near the city have unearthed iron age sites that may date from 500 bce . the region comprising modern hyderabad and its surroundings was known as golkonda ( golla konda- " shepherd 's hill " ) , and was ruled by the chalukya dynasty from 624 ce to 1075 ce . following the dissolution of the chalukya empire into four parts in the 11th century , golkonda came under the control of the kakatiya dynasty from 1158 , whose seat of power was at warangal , 148 km ( 92 mi ) northeast of modern hyderabad .
the 2015 human development report by the united nations development program was released on december 14 , 2015 , and calculates hdi values based on estimates for 2014 . below is the list of the " very high human development " countries :
in december 2005 , imperial announced a science park programme at the wye campus , with extensive housing ; however , this was abandoned in september 2006 following complaints that the proposal infringed on areas of outstanding natural beauty , and that the true scale of the scheme , which could have raised £ 110m for the college , was known to kent and ashford councils and their consultants but concealed from the public . one commentator observed that imperial 's scheme reflected " the state of democracy in kent , the transformation of a renowned scientific college into a grasping , highly aggressive , neo-corporate institution , and the defence of the status of an area of outstanding natural beauty - throughout england , not just wye - against rampant greed backed by the connivance of two important local authorities . wye college campus was finally closed in september 2009 .
amateur football is governed by football canada . at the university level , 26 teams play in four conferences under the auspices of canadian interuniversity sport ; the cis champion is awarded the vanier cup . junior football is played by many after high school before joining the university ranks . there are 20 junior teams in three divisions in the canadian junior football league competing for the canadian bowl . the quebec junior football league includes teams from ontario and quebec who battle for the manson cup .
the evolution of proto-greek should be considered within the context of an early paleo-balkan sprachbund that makes it difficult to delineate exact boundaries between individual languages . the characteristically greek representation of word-initial laryngeals by prothetic vowels is shared , for one , by the armenian language , which also seems to share some other phonological and morphological peculiarities of greek ; this has led some linguists to propose a hypothetical closer relationship between greek and armenian , although evidence remains scant .
bird migration is primarily , but not entirely , a northern hemisphere phenomenon . this is because land birds in high northern latitudes , where food becomes scarce in winter , leave for areas further south ( including the southern hemisphere ) to overwinter , and because the continental landmass is much larger in the northern hemisphere . in contrast , among ( pelagic ) seabirds , species of the southern hemisphere are more likely to migrate . this is because there is a large area of ocean in the southern hemisphere , and more islands suitable for seabirds to nest .
roman canon law had been criticized by the presbyterians as early as 1572 in the admonition to parliament . the protest centered on the standard defense that canon law could be retained so long as it did not contradict the civil law . according to polly ha , the reformed church government refuted this claiming that the bishops had been enforcing canon law for 1500 years .
on april 17 , 1946 , the kaliningrad oblast - the northern portion of the former german province of east prussia - was annexed by the soviet union and made part of the russian sfsr .
indira gandhi international airport , situated to the southwest of delhi , is the main gateway for the city 's domestic and international civilian air traffic . in 2012-13 , the airport was used by more than 35 million passengers , making it one of the busiest airports in south asia . terminal 3 , which cost ₹ 96.8 billion ( us $ 1.4 billion ) to construct between 2007 and 2010 , handles an additional 37 million passengers annually .
physical pain is an important political topic in relation to various issues , including pain management policy , drug control , animal rights or animal welfare , torture , and pain compliance . in various contexts , the deliberate infliction of pain in the form of corporal punishment is used as retribution for an offence , or for the purpose of disciplining or reforming a wrongdoer , or to deter attitudes or behaviour deemed unacceptable . in some cultures , extreme practices such as mortification of the flesh or painful rites of passage are highly regarded .
beginning several centuries ago , during the period of the ottoman empire , tens of thousands of black africans were brought by slave traders to plantations and agricultural areas situated between antalya and istanbul in present-day turkey . some of their descendants remained in situ , and many migrated to larger cities and towns . other blacks slaves were transported to crete , from where they or their descendants later reached the izmir area through the population exchange between greece and turkey in 1923 , or indirectly from ayvalık in pursuit of work .
another set of significant physical changes during puberty happen in bodily distribution of fat and muscle . this process is different for females and males . before puberty , there are nearly no sex differences in fat and muscle distribution ; during puberty , boys grow muscle much faster than girls , although both sexes experience rapid muscle development . in contrast , though both sexes experience an increase in body fat , the increase is much more significant for girls . frequently , the increase in fat for girls happens in their years just before puberty . the ratio between muscle and fat among post-pubertal boys is around three to one , while for girls it is about five to four . this may help explain sex differences in athletic performance .
the history of biodiversity during the phanerozoic ( the last 540 million years ) , starts with rapid growth during the cambrian explosion - a period during which nearly every phylum of multicellular organisms first appeared . over the next 400 million years or so , invertebrate diversity showed little overall trend , and vertebrate diversity shows an overall exponential trend . this dramatic rise in diversity was marked by periodic , massive losses of diversity classified as mass extinction events . a significant loss occurred when rainforests collapsed in the carboniferous . the worst was the permian-triassic extinction event , 251 million years ago . vertebrates took 30 million years to recover from this event .
the migration of birds also aids the movement of other species , including those of ectoparasites such as ticks and lice , which in turn may carry micro-organisms including those of concern to human health . due to the global spread of avian influenza , bird migration has been studied as a possible mechanism of disease transmission , but it has been found not to present a special risk ; import of pet and domestic birds is a greater threat . some viruses that are maintained in birds without lethal effects , such as the west nile virus may however be spread by migrating birds . birds may also have a role in the dispersal of propagules of plants and plankton .
east tennessee has several important transportation links with middle and west tennessee , as well as the rest of the nation and the world , including several major airports and interstates . knoxville 's mcghee tyson airport ( tys ) and chattanooga 's chattanooga metropolitan airport ( cha ) , as well as the tri-cities ' tri-cities regional airport ( tri ) , provide air service to numerous destinations . i-24 , i-81 , i-40 , i-75 , and i-26 along with numerous state highways and other important roads , traverse the grand division and connect chattanooga , knoxville , and the tri-cities , along with other cities and towns such as cleveland , athens , and sevierville .
however , william woodthorpe tarn , between world war i and world war ii and the heyday of the league of nations , focused on the issues of racial and cultural confrontation and the nature of colonial rule . michael rostovtzeff , who fled the russian revolution , concentrated predominantly on the rise of the capitalist bourgeoisie in areas of greek rule . arnaldo momigliano , an italian jew who wrote before and after the second world war , studied the problem of mutual understanding between races in the conquered areas . moses hadas portrayed an optimistic picture of synthesis of culture from the perspective of the 1950s , while frank william walbank in the 1960s and 1970s had a materialistic approach to the hellenistic period , focusing mainly on class relations . recently , however , papyrologist c. preaux has concentrated predominantly on the economic system , interactions between kings and cities and provides a generally pessimistic view on the period . peter green , on the other hand , writes from the point of view of late 20th century liberalism , his focus being on individualism , the breakdown of convention , experiments and a postmodern disillusionment with all institutions and political processes .
gymnastics is a sport involving the performance of exercises requiring strength , flexibility , balance and control . internationally , all events are governed by the federation internationale de gymnastique ( fig ) . each country has its own national governing body ( biw ) affiliated to fig . competitive artistic gymnastics is the best known of the gymnastic events . it typically involves the women 's events of vault , uneven bars , balance beam , and floor exercise . men 's events are floor exercise , pommel horse , still rings , vault , parallel bars , and the high bar . gymnastics evolved from exercises used by the ancient greeks that included skills for mounting and dismounting a horse , and from circus performance skills .
therefore , according to mahayana buddhism , the arahant has attained only nirvana , thus still being subject to delusion , while the bodhisattva not only achieves nirvana but full liberation from delusion as well . he thus attains bodhi and becomes a buddha . in theravada buddhism , bodhi and nirvana carry the same meaning as in the early texts , that of being freed from greed , hate and delusion .
paul 's christology has a specific focus on the death and resurrection of jesus . for paul , the crucifixion of jesus is directly related to his resurrection and the term " the cross of christ " used in galatians 6 : 12 may be viewed as his abbreviation of the message of the gospels . for paul , the crucifixion of jesus was not an isolated event in history , but a cosmic event with significant eschatological consequences , as in 1 corinthians 2 : 8 . in the pauline view , jesus , obedient to the point of death ( philippians 2 : 8 ) died " at the right time " ( romans 4 : 25 ) based on the plan of god . for paul the " power of the cross " is not separable from the resurrection of jesus .
the first historical mention of the use of hops in beer was from 822 ad in monastery rules written by adalhard the elder , also known as adalard of corbie , though the date normally given for widespread cultivation of hops for use in beer is the thirteenth century . before the thirteenth century , and until the sixteenth century , during which hops took over as the dominant flavouring , beer was flavoured with other plants ; for instance , grains of paradise or alehoof . combinations of various aromatic herbs , berries , and even ingredients like wormwood would be combined into a mixture known as gruit and used as hops are now used . some beers today , such as fraoch ' by the scottish heather ales company and cervoise lancelot by the french brasserie-lancelot company , use plants other than hops for flavouring .
quality dropped but variety increased with the introduction of microwave ovens and freezer food . " pub grub " expanded to include british food items such as steak and ale pie , shepherd 's pie , fish and chips , bangers and mash , sunday roast , ploughman 's lunch , and pasties . in addition , dishes such as burgers , chicken wings , lasagne and chilli con carne are often served . some pubs offer elaborate hot and cold snacks free to customers at sunday lunchtimes , to prevent them getting hungry and leaving for their lunch at home .
playstation plus ( commonly abbreviated ps + and occasionally referred to as psn plus ) is a premium playstation network subscription service that was officially unveiled at e3 2010 by jack tretton , president and ceo of scea . rumors of such service had been in speculation since kaz hirai 's announcement at tgs 2009 of a possible paid service for psn but with the current psn service still available . launched alongside ps3 firmware 3.40 and psp firmware 6.30 on june 29 , 2010 , the paid-for subscription service provides users with enhanced services on the playstation network , on top of the current psn service which is still available with all of its features . these enhancements include the ability to have demos , game and system software updates download automatically to playstation 3 . subscribers also get early or exclusive access to some betas , game demos , premium downloadable content and other playstation store items . north american users also get a free subscription to qore . users may choose to purchase either a one-year or a three-month subscription to playstation plus .
von neumann entered government service ( manhattan project ) primarily because he felt that , if freedom and civilization were to survive , it would have to be because the us would triumph over totalitarianism from nazism , fascism and soviet communism . during a senate committee hearing he described his political ideology as " violently anti-communist , and much more militaristic than the norm . " he was quoted in 1950 remarking , " if you say why not bomb [ the soviets ] tomorrow , i say , why not today ? if you say today at five o 'clock , i say why not one o 'clock ? "
lucan depicts sextus pompeius , the doomed son of pompey the great , as convinced " the gods of heaven knew too little " and awaiting the battle of pharsalus by consulting with the thessalian witch erichtho , who practices necromancy and inhabits deserted graves , feeding on rotting corpses . erichtho , it is said , can arrest " the rotation of the heavens and the flow of rivers " and make " austere old men blaze with illicit passions . " she and her clients are portrayed as undermining the natural order of gods , mankind and destiny . a female foreigner from thessaly , notorious for witchcraft , erichtho is the stereotypical witch of latin literature , along with horace 's canidia .
the duke and duchess of york had two children : elizabeth ( called " lilibet " by the family ) , and margaret . the duke and duchess and their two daughters lived a relatively sheltered life at their london residence , 145 piccadilly . they were a close and loving family . one of the few stirs arose when the canadian prime minister , r. b. bennett , considered the duke for governor general of canada in 1931 - a proposal that king george v rejected on the advice of the secretary of state for dominion affairs , j. h. thomas .
economic sanctions against iran , such as the embargo against iranian crude oil , have affected the economy . sanctions have led to a steep fall in the value of the rial , and as of april 2013 one us dollar is worth 36,000 rial , compared with 16,000 in early 2012 . following a successful implementation of the 2015 nuclear and sanctions relief deal , the resulting benefits might not be distributed evenly across the iranian economy as political elites such as the islamic revolutionary guard corps have garnered more resources and economic interests .
present-day slavic people are classified into west slavic ( chiefly poles , czechs and slovaks ) , east slavic ( chiefly russians , belarusians , and ukrainians ) , and south slavic ( chiefly serbs , bulgarians , croats , bosniaks , macedonians , slovenes , and montenegrins ) , though sometimes the west slavs and east slavs are combined into a single group known as north slavs . for a more comprehensive list , see the ethnocultural subdivisions . modern slavic nations and ethnic groups are considerably diverse both genetically and culturally , and relations between them - even within the individual ethnic groups themselves - are varied , ranging from a sense of connection to mutual feelings of hostility .
the french were equipped with bronze , rifled muzzle-loading artillery , while the prussians used new steel breech-loading guns , which had a far longer range and a faster rate of fire . prussian gunners strove for a high rate of fire , which was discouraged in the french army in the belief that it wasted ammunition . in addition , the prussian artillery batteries had 30 % more guns than their french counterparts . the prussian guns typically opened fire at a range of 2-3 kilometres ( 1.2-1.9 mi ) , beyond the range of french artillery or the chassepot rifle . the prussian batteries could thus destroy french artillery with impunity , before being moved forward to directly support infantry attacks .
the germanic peoples during the migrations period came into contact with other peoples ; in the case of the populations settling in the territory of modern germany , they encountered celts to the south , and balts and slavs towards the east . the limes germanicus was breached in ad 260 . migrating germanic tribes commingled with the local gallo-roman populations in what is now swabia and bavaria . the arrival of the huns in europe resulted in hun conquest of large parts of eastern europe , the huns initially were allies of the roman empire who fought against germanic tribes , but later the huns cooperated with the germanic tribe of the ostrogoths , and large numbers of germans lived within the lands of the hunnic empire of attila . attila had both hunnic and germanic families and prominent germanic chiefs amongst his close entourage in europe . the huns living in germanic territories in eastern europe adopted an east germanic language as their lingua franca . a major part of attila 's army were germans , during the huns ' campaign against the roman empire . after attila 's unexpected death the hunnic empire collapsed with the huns disappearing as a people in europe - who either escaped into asia , or otherwise blended in amongst europeans .
the classical era stringed instruments were the four instruments which form the string section of the orchestra : the violin , viola , cello and contrabass . woodwinds included the basset clarinet , basset horn , clarinette d 'amour , the classical clarinet , the chalumeau , the flute , oboe and bassoon . keyboard instruments included the clavichord and the fortepiano . while the harpsichord was still used in basso continuo accompaniment in the 1750s and 1760s , it fell out of use in the end of the century . brass instruments included the buccin , the ophicleide ( a serpent replacement which was the precursor of tuba ) and the natural horn .
they established communities throughout central and eastern europe , which had been their primary region of concentration and residence until recent times , evolving their own distinctive characteristics and diasporic identities . in the late middle ages the center of gravity of the ashkenazi population , and its traditional cultural life , shifted steadily eastward , out of the german lands into poland and lithuania ( including present-day belarus and ukraine ) . in the course of the late 18th and 19th centuries , those jews who remained in or returned to the german lands experienced a cultural reorientation ; under the influence of the haskalah and the struggle for emancipation , as well the intellectual and cultural ferment in urban centers , they gradually abandoned the use of yiddish , while developing new forms of jewish religious life and cultural identity .
despite the dominance of the above formula , there are documented attempts of the financial industry , occurring before the crisis , to address the formula limitations , specifically the lack of dependence dynamics and the poor representation of extreme events . the volume " credit correlation : life after copulas , " published in 2007 by world scientific , summarizes a 2006 conference held by merrill lynch in london where several practitioners attempted to propose models rectifying some of the copula limitations . see also the article by donnelly and embrechts and the book by brigo , pallavicini and torresetti , that reports relevant warnings and research on cdos appeared in 2006 .
for fortification , however , a 2003 review recommended zinc oxide in cereals as cheap , stable , and as easily absorbed as more expensive forms . a 2005 study found that various compounds of zinc , including oxide and sulfate , did not show statistically significant differences in absorption when added as fortificants to maize tortillas . a 1987 study found that zinc picolinate was better absorbed than zinc gluconate or zinc citrate . however , a study published in 2008 determined that zinc glycinate is the best absorbed of the four dietary supplement types available .
the roots of greek success in the ottoman empire can be traced to the greek tradition of education and commerce . it was the wealth of the extensive merchant class that provided the material basis for the intellectual revival that was the prominent feature of greek life in the half century and more leading to the outbreak of the greek war of independence in 1821 . not coincidentally , on the eve of 1821 , the three most important centres of greek learning were situated in chios , smyrna and aivali , all three major centres of greek commerce . greek success was also favoured by greek domination of the christian orthodox church .
some species use vibrations for communicating within members of the same species , such as to attract mates as in the songs of the shield bug nezara viridula . vibrations can also be used to communicate between entirely different species ; lycaenid ( gossamer-winged butterfly ) caterpillars which are myrmecophilous ( living in a mutualistic association with ants ) communicate with ants in this way . the madagascar hissing cockroach has the ability to press air through its spiracles to make a hissing noise as a sign of aggression ; the death 's-head hawkmoth makes a squeaking noise by forcing air out of their pharynx when agitated , which may also reduce aggressive worker honey bee behavior when the two are in close proximity .
late in the 19th century , paris hosted two major international expositions : the 1889 universal exposition , was held to mark the centennial of the french revolution and featured the new eiffel tower ; and the 1900 universal exposition , which gave paris the pont alexandre iii , the grand palais , the petit palais and the first paris metro line . paris became the laboratory of naturalism ( emile zola ) and symbolism ( charles baudelaire and paul verlaine ) , and of impressionism in art ( courbet , manet , monet , renoir . )
the kingdoms of england and scotland were unified in 1707 creating the kingdom of great britain . following an attempted republican revolution in ireland in 1798 , the kingdoms of ireland and great britain were unified in 1801 , creating the united kingdom . the isle of man and the channel islands remaining outside of the united kingdom but with their ultimate good governance being the responsibility of the british crown ( effectively the british government ) . although , the colonies of north american that would become the united states of america were lost by the start of the 19th century , the british empire expanded rapidly elsewhere . a century later it would cover one third of the globe . poverty in the united kingdom remained desperate however and industrialisation in england led to terrible condition for the working class . mass migrations following the irish famine and highland clearances resulted in the distribution of the islands ' population and culture throughout the world and a rapid de-population of ireland in the second-half of the 19th century . most of ireland seceded from the united kingdom after the irish war of independence and the subsequent anglo-irish treaty ( 1919-1922 ) , with the six counties that formed northern ireland remaining as an autonomous region of the uk .
the infrared portion of the spectrum has several useful benefits for astronomers . cold , dark molecular clouds of gas and dust in our galaxy will glow with radiated heat as they are irradiated by imbedded stars . infrared can also be used to detect protostars before they begin to emit visible light . stars emit a smaller portion of their energy in the infrared spectrum , so nearby cool objects such as planets can be more readily detected . ( in the visible light spectrum , the glare from the star will drown out the reflected light from a planet . )
napoleon returned to paris and found that both the legislature and the people had turned against him . realizing his position was untenable , he abdicated on 22 june in favour of his son . he left paris three days later and settled at josephine 's former palace in malmaison ( on the western bank of the seine about 17 kilometres ( 11 mi ) west of paris ) . even as napoleon travelled to paris , the coalition forces crossed the frontier swept through france ( arriving in the vicinity of paris on 29 june ) , with the stated intent on restoring louis xviii to the french throne .
davies ' and gribbin 's objections are shared by proponents of digital physics who view information rather than matter to be fundamental . their objections were also shared by some founders of quantum theory , such as max planck , who wrote :
pitt 's act was deemed a failure because it quickly became apparent that the boundaries between government control and the company 's powers were nebulous and highly subjective . the government felt obliged to respond to humanitarian calls for better treatment of local peoples in british-occupied territories . edmund burke , a former east india company shareholder and diplomat , was moved to address the situation and introduced a new regulating bill in 1783 . the bill was defeated amid lobbying by company loyalists and accusations of nepotism in the bill 's recommendations for the appointment of councillors .
pope sixtus v limited the number of cardinals to 70 , comprising six cardinal bishops , 50 cardinal priests , and 14 cardinal deacons . starting in the pontificate of pope john xxiii , that limit has been exceeded . at the start of 1971 , pope paul vi set the number of cardinal electors at a maximum of 120 , but set no limit on the number of cardinals generally . he also established a maximum age of eighty years for electors . his action deprived twenty-five living cardinals , including the three living cardinals elevated by pope pius xi , of the right to participate in a conclave . [ citation needed ] popes can dispense from church laws and have sometimes brought the number of cardinals under the age of 80 to more than 120 . pope paul vi also increased the number of cardinal bishops by giving that rank to patriarchs of the eastern catholic churches .
translation of sung texts is generally much more restrictive than translation of poetry , because in the former there is little or no freedom to choose between a versified translation and a translation that dispenses with verse structure . one might modify or omit rhyme in a singing translation , but the assignment of syllables to specific notes in the original musical setting places great challenges on the translator . there is the option in prose sung texts , less so in verse , of adding or deleting a syllable here and there by subdividing or combining notes , respectively , but even with prose the process is almost like strict verse translation because of the need to stick as closely as possible to the original prosody of the sung melodic line .
west of the historic center ( centro historico ) along paseo de la reforma are many of the city 's wealthiest neighborhoods such as polanco , lomas de chapultepec , bosques de las lomas , santa fe , and ( in the state of mexico ) interlomas , which are also the city 's most important areas of class a office space , corporate headquarters , skyscrapers and shopping malls . nevertheless , areas of lower income colonias exist in some cases cheek-by-jowl with rich neighborhoods , particularly in the case of santa fe .

air defence in naval tactics , especially within a carrier group , is often built around a system of concentric layers with the aircraft carrier at the centre . the outer layer will usually be provided by the carrier 's aircraft , specifically its aew & c aircraft combined with the cap . if an attacker is able to penetrate this layer , then the next layers would come from the surface-to-air missiles carried by the carrier 's escorts ; the area-defence missiles , such as the rim-67 standard , with a range of up to 100 nmi , and the point-defence missiles , like the rim-162 essm , with a range of up to 30 nmi . finally , virtually every modern warship will be fitted with small-calibre guns , including a ciws , which is usually a radar-controlled gatling gun of between 20mm and 30mm calibre capable of firing several thousand rounds per minute .
on 6 february 2015 , it was announced that judge richard marks is to be replaced by judge charles wide at the retrial . two days earlier , marks had emailed counsel for the defendants telling them : " it has been decided ( not by me but by my elders and betters ) that i am not going to be doing the retrial . " reporting the decision in uk newspaper the guardian , lisa o 'carroll wrote : " wide is the only judge so far to have presided in a case which has seen a conviction of a journalist in relation to allegations of unlawful payments to public officials for stories . the journalist , who cannot be named for legal reasons , is appealing the verdict . " defence counsel for the four journalists threatened to take the decision to judicial review , with the barrister representing pharo , nigel rumfitt qc , saying : " the way this has come about gives rise to the impression that something has been going on behind the scenes which should not have been going on behind the scenes and which should have been dealt with transparently . " he added that the defendants were " extremely concerned " and " entitled " to know why marks was being replaced by wide .
it threatened the collapse of large financial institutions , which was prevented by the bailout of banks by national governments , but stock markets still dropped worldwide . in many areas , the housing market also suffered , resulting in evictions , foreclosures and prolonged unemployment . the crisis played a significant role in the failure of key businesses , declines in consumer wealth estimated in trillions of u.s. dollars , and a downturn in economic activity leading to the 2008-2012 global recession and contributing to the european sovereign-debt crisis . the active phase of the crisis , which manifested as a liquidity crisis , can be dated from august 9 , 2007 , when bnp paribas terminated withdrawals from three hedge funds citing " a complete evaporation of liquidity . "
another example of the persecution of heretics under protestant rule was the execution of the boston martyrs in 1659 , 1660 , and 1661 . these executions resulted from the actions of the anglican puritans , who at that time wielded political as well as ecclesiastic control in the massachusetts bay colony . at the time , the colony leaders were apparently hoping to achieve their vision of a " purer absolute theocracy " within their colony . [ citation needed ] as such , they perceived the teachings and practices of the rival quaker sect as heretical , even to the point where laws were passed and executions were performed with the aim of ridding their colony of such perceived " heresies . " [ citation needed ] it should be noticed that the eastern orthodox and oriental orthodox communions generally regard the puritans themselves as having been heterodox or heretical .
fryderyk may have had some piano instruction from his mother , but his first professional music tutor , from 1816 to 1821 , was the czech pianist wojciech zywny . his elder sister ludwika also took lessons from zywny , and occasionally played duets with her brother . it quickly became apparent that he was a child prodigy . by the age of seven fryderyk had begun giving public concerts , and in 1817 he composed two polonaises , in g minor and b-flat major . his next work , a polonaise in a-flat major of 1821 , dedicated to zywny , is his earliest surviving musical manuscript .
the city has undergone many changes to its governance over the centuries and once again became administratively independent from hampshire county as it was made into a unitary authority in a local government reorganisation on 1 april 1997 , a result of the 1992 local government act . the district remains part of the hampshire ceremonial county .
in the early 11th century , the muslim physicist ibn al-haytham ( alhacen or alhazen ) discussed space perception and its epistemological implications in his book of optics ( 1021 ) , he also rejected aristotle 's definition of topos ( physics iv ) by way of geometric demonstrations and defined place as a mathematical spatial extension . his experimental proof of the intromission model of vision led to changes in the understanding of the visual perception of space , contrary to the previous emission theory of vision supported by euclid and ptolemy . in " tying the visual perception of space to prior bodily experience , alhacen unequivocally rejected the intuitiveness of spatial perception and , therefore , the autonomy of vision . without tangible notions of distance and size for correlation , sight can tell us next to nothing about such things . "
pioneer electronics also entered the optical disc market in 1977 as a 50 / 50 joint-venture with mca called universal-pioneer and manufacturing mca designed industrial players under the mca discovision name ( the pr-7800 and pr-7820 ) . for the 1980 launch of the first universal-pioneer player , the vp-1000 was noted as a " laser disc player , " although the " laserdisc " logo displayed clearly on the device . in 1981 , " laserdisc " was used exclusively for the medium itself , although the official name was " laservision " ( as seen at the beginning of many laserdisc releases just before the start of the film ) . however , as pioneer reminded numerous video magazines and stores in 1984 , laserdisc was a trademarked word , standing only for laservision products manufactured for sale by pioneer video or pioneer electronics . a 1984 ray charles ad for the ld-700 player bore the term " pioneer laserdisc brand videodisc player . " from 1981 until the early 1990s , all properly licensed discs carried the laservision name and logo , even pioneer artists titles .
from 1997 to 2004 , dell enjoyed steady growth and it gained market share from competitors even during industry slumps . during the same period , rival pc vendors such as compaq , gateway , ibm , packard bell , and ast research struggled and eventually left the market or were bought out . dell surpassed compaq to become the largest pc manufacturer in 1999 . operating costs made up only 10 percent of dell 's $ 35 billion in revenue in 2002 , compared with 21 percent of revenue at hewlett-packard , 25 percent at gateway , and 46 percent at cisco . in 2002 , when compaq merged with hewlett packard ( the fourth-place pc maker ) , the newly combined hewlett packard took the top spot but struggled and dell soon regained its lead . dell grew the fastest in the early 2000s .
passive air defence is defined by nato as " passive measures taken for the physical defence and protection of personnel , essential installations and equipment in order to minimize the effectiveness of air and / or missile attack .

following the breakup of the russian empire in the aftermath of world war i for a brief period , from 1918 to 1920 , armenia was an independent republic . in late 1920 , the communists came to power following an invasion of armenia by the red army , and in 1922 , armenia became part of the transcaucasian sfsr of the soviet union , later forming the armenian soviet socialist republic ( 1936 to september 21 , 1991 ) . in 1991 , armenia declared independence from the ussr and established the second republic of armenia .
two chains of dna twist around each other to form a dna double helix with the phosphate-sugar backbone spiralling around the outside , and the bases pointing inwards with adenine base pairing to thymine and guanine to cytosine . the specificity of base pairing occurs because adenine and thymine align form two hydrogen bonds , whereas cytosine and guanine form three hydrogen bonds . the two strands in a double helix must therefore be complementary , with their sequence of bases matching such that the adenines of one strand are paired with the thymines of the other strand , and so on . : 4.1
in france , the established men of letters ( gens de lettres ) had fused with the elites ( les grands ) of french society by the mid-18th century . this led to the creation of an oppositional literary sphere , grub street , the domain of a " multitude of versifiers and would-be authors . " these men came to london to become authors , only to discover that the literary market simply could not support large numbers of writers , who , in any case , were very poorly remunerated by the publishing-bookselling guilds .
bonaparte could win battles by concealment of troop deployments and concentration of his forces on the ' hinge ' of an enemy 's weakened front . if he could not use his favourite envelopment strategy , he would take up the central position and attack two co-operating forces at their hinge , swing round to fight one until it fled , then turn to face the other . in this italian campaign , bonaparte 's army captured 150,000 prisoners , 540 cannons , and 170 standards . the french army fought 67 actions and won 18 pitched battles through superior artillery technology and bonaparte 's tactics .
the term " house music " is said to have originated from a chicago club called the warehouse , which existed from 1977 to 1983 . clubbers to the warehouse were primarily black and gay , who came to dance to music played by the club 's resident dj frankie knuckles , whom fans refer to as the " godfather of house . " after the warehouse closed in 1983 , the crowds went to knuckles ' new club , the power plant . in the channel 4 documentary pump up the volume , knuckles remarks that the first time he heard the term " house music " was upon seeing " we play house music " on a sign in the window of a bar on chicago 's south side . one of the people in the car with him joked , " you know , that 's the kind of music you play down at the warehouse ! , " and then everybody laughed . south-side chicago dj leonard " remix " roy , in self-published statements , claims he put such a sign in a tavern window because it was where he played music that one might find in one 's home ; in his case , it referred to his mother 's soul & disco records , which he worked into his sets . farley jackmaster funk was quoted as saying " in 1982 , i was djing at a club called the playground and there was this kid named leonard ' remix ' roy who was a dj at a rival club called the rink . he came over to my club one night , and into the dj booth and said to me , ' i 've got the gimmick that 's gonna take all the people out of your club and into mine - it 's called house music . ' now , where he got that name from or what made him think of it i don 't know , so the answer lies with him . "
john locke in particular exemplified this new age of political theory with his work two treatises of government . in it locke proposes a state of nature theory that directly complements his conception of how political development occurs and how it can be founded through contractual obligation . locke stood to refute sir robert filmer 's paternally founded political theory in favor of a natural system based on nature in a particular given system . the theory of the divine right of kings became a passing fancy , exposed to the type of ridicule with which john locke treated it . unlike machiavelli and hobbes but like aquinas , locke would accept aristotle 's dictum that man seeks to be happy in a state of social harmony as a social animal . unlike aquinas 's preponderant view on the salvation of the soul from original sin , locke believes man 's mind comes into this world as tabula rasa . for locke , knowledge is neither innate , revealed nor based on authority but subject to uncertainty tempered by reason , tolerance and moderation . according to locke , an absolute ruler as proposed by hobbes is unnecessary , for natural law is based on reason and seeking peace and survival for man .
the grito de dolores ( " cry of dolores " ) also known as el grito de la independencia ( " cry of independence " ) , uttered from the small town of dolores near guanajuato on september 16 , 1810 , is the event that marks the beginning of the mexican war of independence and is the most important national holiday observed in mexico . the " grito " was the battle cry of the mexican war of independence by miguel hidalgo y costilla , a roman catholic priest . hidalgo and several criollos were involved in a planned revolt against the spanish colonial government , and the plotters were betrayed . fearing his arrest , hidalgo commanded his brother mauricio as well as ignacio allende and mariano abasolo to go with a number of other armed men to make the sheriff release the pro-independence inmates there on the night of september 15 . they managed to set eighty free . around 6 : 00 am september 16 , 1810 , hidalgo ordered the church bells to be rung and gathered his congregation . flanked by allende and juan aldama , he addressed the people in front of his church , encouraging them to revolt . the battle of guanajuato , the first major engagement of the insurgency , occurred four days later . mexico 's independence from spain was effectively declared in the declaration of independence of the mexican empire on september 27 , 1821 , after a decade of war . unrest followed for the next several decades , as different factions fought for control of mexico .
east prussia enclosed the bulk of the ancestral lands of the baltic old prussians . during the 13th century , the native prussians were conquered by the crusading teutonic knights . the indigenous balts who survived the conquest were gradually converted to christianity . because of germanization and colonisation over the following centuries , germans became the dominant ethnic group , while poles and lithuanians formed minorities . from the 13th century , east prussia was part of the monastic state of the teutonic knights . after the second peace of thorn in 1466 it became a fief of the kingdom of poland . in 1525 , with the prussian homage , the province became the duchy of prussia . the old prussian language had become extinct by the 17th or early 18th century .

during the 14th century in the northeastern part of the state nomad tribes by the name of jornado hunted bison along the rio grande ; they left numerous rock paintings throughout the northeastern part of the state . when the spanish explorers reached this area they found their descendants , suma and manso tribes . in the southern part of the state , in a region known as aridoamerica , chichimeca people survived by hunting , gathering , and farming between ad 300 and 1300 . the chichimeca are the ancestors of the tepehuan people .
in the 9th century , the rise of the cult of the apostle james in santiago de compostela gave galicia a particular symbolic importance among christians , an importance it would hold throughout the reconquista . as the middle ages went on , santiago became a major pilgrim destination and the way of saint james ( camino de santiago ) a major pilgrim road , a route for the propagation of romanesque art and the words and music of the troubadors . during the 10th and 11th centuries , a period during which galician nobility become related to the royal family , galicia was at times headed by its own native kings , while vikings ( locally known as leodemanes or lordomanes ) occasionally raided the coasts . the towers of catoira ( pontevedra ) were built as a system of fortifications to prevent and stop the viking raids on santiago de compostela .
morales began work on his " indigenous autonomy " policy , which he launched in the eastern lowlands department on august 3 , 2009 , making bolivia the first country in the history of south america to affirm the right of indigenous people to govern themselves . speaking in santa cruz department , the president called it " a historic day for the peasant and indigenous movement , " saying that , though he might make errors , he would " never betray the fight started by our ancestors and the fight of the bolivian people .

studio producers richard d. zanuck and david brown offered spielberg the director 's chair for jaws , a thriller-horror film based on the peter benchley novel about an enormous killer shark . spielberg has often referred to the gruelling shoot as his professional crucible . despite the film 's ultimate , enormous success , it was nearly shut down due to delays and budget over-runs . but spielberg persevered and finished the film . it was an enormous hit , winning three academy awards ( for editing , original score and sound ) and grossing more than $ 470 million worldwide at the box office . it also set the domestic record for box office gross , leading to what the press described as " jawsmania . " : 248 jaws made spielberg a household name and one of america 's youngest multi-millionaires , allowing him a great deal of autonomy for his future projects . : 250 it was nominated for best picture and featured spielberg 's first of three collaborations with actor richard dreyfuss .
jeffrey long and rick kittles give a long critique of the application of fst to human populations in their 2003 paper " human genetic diversity and the nonexistence of biological races . " they find that the figure of 85 % is misleading because it implies that all human populations contain on average 85 % of all genetic diversity . they claim that this does not correctly reflect human population history , because it treats all human groups as independent . a more realistic portrayal of the way human groups are related is to understand that some human groups are parental to other groups and that these groups represent paraphyletic groups to their descent groups . for example , under the recent african origin theory the human population in africa is paraphyletic to all other human groups because it represents the ancestral group from which all non-african populations derive , but more than that , non-african groups only derive from a small non-representative sample of this african population . this means that all non-african groups are more closely related to each other and to some african groups ( probably east africans ) than they are to others , and further that the migration out of africa represented a genetic bottleneck , with much of the diversity that existed in africa not being carried out of africa by the emigrating groups . this view produces a version of human population movements that do not result in all human populations being independent ; but rather , produces a series of dilutions of diversity the further from africa any population lives , each founding event representing a genetic subset of its parental population . long and kittles find that rather than 85 % of human genetic diversity existing in all human populations , about 100 % of human diversity exists in a single african population , whereas only about 70 % of human genetic diversity exists in a population derived from new guinea . long and kittles argued that this still produces a global human population that is genetically homogeneous compared to other mammalian populations .
in 1961 , nasser sought to firmly establish egypt as the leader of the arab world and to promote a second revolution in egypt with the purpose of merging islamic and socialist thinking . to achieve this , he initiated several reforms to modernize al-azhar , which serves as the de facto leading authority in sunni islam , and to ensure its prominence over the muslim brotherhood and the more conservative wahhabism promoted by saudi arabia . nasser had used al-azhar 's most willing ulema ( scholars ) as a counterweight to the brotherhood 's islamic influence , starting in 1953 .
bell began a series of public demonstrations and lectures to introduce the new invention to the scientific community as well as the general public . a short time later , his demonstration of an early telephone prototype at the 1876 centennial exposition in philadelphia brought the telephone to international attention . influential visitors to the exhibition included emperor pedro ii of brazil . later bell had the opportunity to demonstrate the invention personally to sir william thomson ( later , lord kelvin ) , a renowned scottish scientist , as well as to queen victoria , who had requested a private audience at osborne house , her isle of wight home . she called the demonstration " most extraordinary . " the enthusiasm surrounding bell 's public displays laid the groundwork for universal acceptance of the revolutionary device .
the average annual rainfall ranges from very low in the northern and southern fringes of the desert to nearly non-existent over the central and the eastern part . the thin northern fringe of the desert receives more winter cloudiness and rainfall due to the arrival of low pressure systems over the mediterranean sea along the polar front , although very attenuated by the rain shadow effects of the mountains and the annual average rainfall ranges from 100 mm ( 3,93 in ) to 250 mm ( 9,84 in ) . for example , biskra , algeria and ouarzazate , morocco are found in this zone . the southern fringe of the desert along the border with the sahel receives summer cloudiness and rainfall due to the arrival of the intertropical convergence zone from the south and the annual average rainfall ranges from 100 mm ( 3,93 in ) to 250 mm ( 9,84 in ) . for example , timbuktu , mali and agadez , niger are found in this zone . the vast central hyper-arid core of the desert is virtually never affected by northerly or southerly atmospheric disturbances and permanently remains under the influence of the strongest anticyclonic weather regime and the annual average rainfall can drop to less than 1 mm ( 0.04 in ) . in fact , most of the sahara receives less than 20 mm ( 0.79 in ) . of the 9,000,000 km2 of desert land in the sahara , an area of about 2,800,000 km2 ( about 31 % of the total area ) receives an annual average rainfall amount of 10 mm ( 0.39 in ) or less , while some 1,500,000 km2 ( about 17 % of the total area ) receive an average of 5 mm or less . the annual average rainfall is virtually zero over a wide area of some 1,000,000 km2 in the eastern sahara comprising deserts of libya , egypt and sudan ( tazirbu , kufra , dakhla , kharga , farafra , siwa , asyut , sohag , luxor , aswan , abu simbel , wadi halfa ) where the long-term mean approximates 0.5 mm per year . the rainfall is very unreliable and erratic in the sahara as it may vary considerably year by year . in full contrast to the negligible annual rainfall amounts , the annual rates of potential evaporation are extraordinarily high , roughly ranging from 2,500 mm / year to more than 6,000 mm / year in the whole desert . nowhere else on earth has air been found as dry and evaporative as in the sahara region . with such an evaporative power , the sahara can only be desiccated and dried out further more and the moisture deficit is tremendous .
new haven was the host of the 1995 special olympics world summer games ; then-president bill clinton spoke at the opening ceremonies . the city is home to the pilot pen international tennis event , which takes place every august at the connecticut tennis center , one of the largest tennis venues in the world . new haven biannually hosts " the game " between yale and harvard , the country 's second-oldest college football rivalry . numerous road races take place in new haven , including the usa 20k championship during the new haven road race .
in indian philosophy , yoga is among other things , the name of one of the six astika philosophical schools . the yoga philosophical system is closely allied with the dualism premises of samkhya school . the yoga school accepts the samkhya psychology and metaphysics , but is considered theistic because it accepts the concept of " personal god , " unlike samkhya . the epistemology of the yoga school , like the samkhya school , relies on three of six pramanas as the means of gaining reliable knowledge : pratyaksa ( perception ) , anumana ( inference ) and sabda ( aptavacana , word / testimony of reliable sources ) .
the foundation explains on its website that its trustees divided the organization into two entities : the bill & melinda gates foundation ( foundation ) and the bill & melinda gates foundation trust ( trust ) . the foundation section , based in seattle , us , " focuses on improving health and alleviating extreme poverty , " and its trustees are bill and melinda gates and warren buffett . the trust section manages " the investment assets and transfer proceeds to the foundation as necessary to achieve the foundation 's charitable goals " - it holds the assets of bill and melinda gates , who are the sole trustees , and receives contributions from buffett .
upon his election to the papacy , montini took the pontifical name paul vi ( the first to take the name " paul " since 1605 ) to indicate a renewed worldwide mission to spread the message of christ , following the example of apostle st. paul . [ citation needed ] he re-convened the second vatican council , which was automatically closed with the death of john xxiii , and gave it priority and direction . after the council had concluded its work , paul vi took charge of the interpretation and implementation of its mandates , often walking a thin line between the conflicting expectations of various groups within catholicism . the magnitude and depth of the reforms affecting all fields of church life during his pontificate exceeded similar reform policies of his predecessors and successors . paul vi was a marian devotee , speaking repeatedly to marian congresses and mariological meetings , visiting marian shrines and issuing three marian encyclicals . following his famous predecessor saint ambrose of milan , he named mary as the mother of the church during the second vatican council . paul vi sought dialogue with the world , with other christians , other religions , and atheists , excluding nobody . he saw himself as a humble servant for a suffering humanity and demanded significant changes of the rich in north america and europe in favour of the poor in the third world . his positions on birth control , promulgated most famously in the 1968 encyclical humanae vitae , and other political issues , were often controversial , especially in western europe and north america .
during the american revolutionary war , fort watauga at sycamore shoals ( in present-day elizabethton ) was attacked ( 1776 ) by dragging canoe and his warring faction of cherokee who were aligned with the british loyalists . these renegade cherokee were referred to by settlers as the chickamauga . they opposed north carolina 's annexation of the washington district and the concurrent settling of the transylvania colony further north and west . the lives of many settlers were spared from the initial warrior attacks through the warnings of dragging canoe 's cousin , nancy ward . the frontier fort on the banks of the watauga river later served as a 1780 staging area for the overmountain men in preparation to trek over the appalachian mountains , to engage , and to later defeat the british army at the battle of kings mountain in south carolina .
federations often have special procedures for amendment of the federal constitution . as well as reflecting the federal structure of the state this may guarantee that the self-governing status of the component states cannot be abolished without their consent . an amendment to the constitution of the united states must be ratified by three-quarters of either the state legislatures , or of constitutional conventions specially elected in each of the states , before it can come into effect . in referendums to amend the constitutions of australia and switzerland it is required that a proposal be endorsed not just by an overall majority of the electorate in the nation as a whole , but also by separate majorities in each of a majority of the states or cantons . in australia , this latter requirement is known as a double majority .
on july 1 , 2014 , the university of notre dame and under armour reached an agreement in which under armour will provide uniforms , apparel , equipment , and monetary compensation to notre dame for 10 years . this contract , worth almost $ 100 million , is the most lucrative in the history of the ncaa . the university marching band plays at home games for most of the sports . the band , which began in 1846 and has a claim as the oldest university band in continuous existence in the united states , was honored by the national music council as a " landmark of american music " during the united states bicentennial . the band regularly plays the school 's fight song the notre dame victory march , which was named as the most played and most famous fight song by northern illinois professor william studwell . according to college fight songs : an annotated anthology published in 1998 , the " notre dame victory march " ranks as the greatest fight song of all time .
royal assent is the method by which a country 's constitutional monarch ( possibly through a delegated official ) formally approves an act of that nation 's parliament , thus making it a law or letting it be promulgated as law . in the vast majority of contemporary monarchies , this act is considered to be little more than a formality ; even in those nations which still permit their ruler to withhold the royal assent ( such as the united kingdom , norway , and liechtenstein ) , the monarch almost never does so , save in a dire political emergency or upon the advice of their government . while the power to withhold royal assent was once exercised often in european monarchies , it is exceedingly rare in the modern , democratic political atmosphere that has developed there since the 18th century .
the coverage of the events by the media came under scrutiny during the relay . chinese media coverage of the torch relay has been distinct in a number of ways from coverage elsewhere . western reporters in beijing have described chinese media coverage as partial and censored ( for example when chinese media did not broadcast reporters without borders ' disruption of the torch lighting ceremony ) , whereas chinese netizens have in turn accused western media coverage of being biased . the french newspaper liberation was criticised by the chinese state press agency xinhua for its allegedly biased reporting ; xinhua suggested that liberation needed " a stinging slap in the face " for having " insulted the olympic flame " and " supported a handful of saboteurs . "
the discipline of ecology typically traces its origin to the synthesis of darwinian evolution and humboldtian biogeography , in the late 19th and early 20th centuries . equally important in the rise of ecology , however , were microbiology and soil science - particularly the cycle of life concept , prominent in the work louis pasteur and ferdinand cohn . the word ecology was coined by ernst haeckel , whose particularly holistic view of nature in general ( and darwin 's theory in particular ) was important in the spread of ecological thinking . in the 1930s , arthur tansley and others began developing the field of ecosystem ecology , which combined experimental soil science with physiological concepts of energy and the techniques of field biology . the history of ecology in the 20th century is closely tied to that of environmentalism ; the gaia hypothesis , first formulated in the 1960s , and spreading in the 1970s , and more recently the scientific-religious movement of deep ecology have brought the two closer together .
as of 2013 , the global advertising agencies of omnicom group and interpublic group , both based in manhattan , had combined annual revenues of approximately us $ 21 billion , reflecting new york city 's role as the top global center for the advertising industry , which is metonymously referred to as " madison avenue . " the city 's fashion industry provides approximately 180,000 employees with $ 11 billion in annual wages .
in 2010 , a genetic study was conducted on the mummified remains of baboons that were brought back as gifts from punt by the ancient egyptians . led by a research team from the egyptian museum and the university of california , the scientists used oxygen isotope analysis to examine hairs from two baboon mummies that had been preserved in the british museum . one of the baboons had distorted isotopic data , so the other 's oxygen isotope values were compared to those of present-day baboon specimens from regions of interest . the researchers found that the mummies most closely matched modern baboon specimens in eritrea and ethiopia , which they suggested implied that punt was likely a narrow region that included eastern ethiopia and all of eritrea .
on 7 july 2004 , in response to verbal attacks in liverpool on wayne rooney , just before his transfer from everton to manchester united , who had sold his life story to the sun , the paper devoted a full-page editorial to an apology for the " awful error " of its hillsborough coverage and argued that rooney ( who was still only three years old at the time of hillsborough ) should not be punished for its " past sins . " in january 2005 , the sun 's managing editor graham dudman admitting the hillsborough coverage was " the worst mistake in our history , " added : " what we did was a terrible mistake . it was a terrible , insensitive , horrible article , with a dreadful headline ; but what we 'd also say is : we have apologised for it , and the entire senior team here now is completely different from the team that put the paper out in 1989 .

brasilia ( portuguese pronunciation : [ bɾaˈziljɐ ] ) is the federal capital of brazil and seat of government of the federal district . the city is located atop the brazilian highlands in the country 's center-western region . it was founded on april 21 , 1960 , to serve as the new national capital . brasilia and its metro ( encompassing the whole of the federal district ) had a population of 2,556,149 in 2011 , making it the 4th most populous city in brazil . among major latin american cities , brasilia has the highest gdp per capita at r $ 61,915 ( us $ 36,175 ) .
during the 1800s christian missionaries from great britain and the united states followed traders to the hawaiian islands . long-termly , the anglo-saxon presence negatively impacted the level of regard hawaiian royal women held for their own indigenous looks . for centuries prior the arrival of christians , first nation hawaiian aesthetics , such as dark skin and ample bodies , had been considered signs of nobility . no matter how much they adapted their mannerisms to western standard , some of the anglo-saxon missionaries were relentless in referring to the indigenous women as " hawaiian squaws . " by the last half of the 19th century , some hawaiian women began marrying european men who found them exotic . the men , however , selected hawaiian women who were thinner and paler in complexion .
neptune is not visible to the unaided eye and is the only planet in the solar system found by mathematical prediction rather than by empirical observation . unexpected changes in the orbit of uranus led alexis bouvard to deduce that its orbit was subject to gravitational perturbation by an unknown planet . neptune was subsequently observed with a telescope on 23 september 1846 by johann galle within a degree of the position predicted by urbain le verrier . its largest moon , triton , was discovered shortly thereafter , though none of the planet 's remaining known 14 moons were located telescopically until the 20th century . the planet 's distance from earth gives it a very small apparent size , making it challenging to study with earth-based telescopes . neptune was visited by voyager 2 , when it flew by the planet on 25 august 1989 . the advent of hubble space telescope and large ground-based telescopes with adaptive optics has recently allowed for additional detailed observations from afar .
the authors of the study also examined 77 college textbooks in biology and 69 in physical anthropology published between 1932 and 1989 . physical anthropology texts argued that biological races exist until the 1970s , when they began to argue that races do not exist . in contrast , biology textbooks did not undergo such a reversal but many instead dropped their discussion of race altogether . the authors attributed this to biologists trying to avoid discussing the political implications of racial classifications , instead of discussing them , and to the ongoing discussions in biology about the validity of the concept " subspecies . " the authors also noted that some widely used textbooks in biology such as douglas j. futuyama 's 1986 " evolutionary biology " had abandoned the race concept , " the concept of race , masking the overwhelming genetic similarity of all peoples and the mosaic patterns of variation that do not correspond to racial divisions , is not only socially dysfunctional but is biologically indefensible as well ( pp. 5 18-5 19 ) . " ( lieberman et al . 1992 , pp. 316-17 )
in the early part of the 20th century , san diego hosted two world 's fairs : the panama-california exposition in 1915 and the california pacific international exposition in 1935 . both expositions were held in balboa park , and many of the spanish / baroque-style buildings that were built for those expositions remain to this day as central features of the park . the buildings were intended to be temporary structures , but most remained in continuous use until they progressively fell into disrepair . most were eventually rebuilt , using castings of the original facades to retain the architectural style . the menagerie of exotic animals featured at the 1915 exposition provided the basis for the san diego zoo . during the 1950s there was a citywide festival called fiesta del pacifico highlighting the area 's spanish and mexican past . in the 2010s there was a proposal for a large-scale celebration of the 100th anniversary of balboa park , but the plans were abandoned when the organization tasked with putting on the celebration went out of business .
palermo ( italian : [ paˈlɛrmo ] ( listen ) , sicilian : palermu , latin : panormus , from greek : πανορμος , panormos , arabic : بلرم , balarm ; phoenician : זיז , ziz ) is a city in insular italy , the capital of both the autonomous region of sicily and the province of palermo . the city is noted for its history , culture , architecture and gastronomy , playing an important role throughout much of its existence ; it is over 2,700 years old . palermo is located in the northwest of the island of sicily , right by the gulf of palermo in the tyrrhenian sea .
on 7 june 1950 , kim il-sung called for a korea-wide election on 5-8 august 1950 and a consultative conference in haeju on 15-17 june 1950 . on 11 june , the north sent three diplomats to the south , as a peace overture that rhee rejected . on 21 june , kim il-sung revised his war plan to involve general attack across the 38th parallel , rather than a limited operation in the ongjin peninsula . kim was concerned that south korean agents had learned about the plans and south korean forces were strengthening their defenses . stalin agreed to this change of plan .
apple spent $ 2.5 million purchasing all 39 advertising pages in a special , post-election issue of newsweek , and ran a " test drive a macintosh " promotion , in which potential buyers with a credit card could take home a macintosh for 24 hours and return it to a dealer afterwards . while 200,000 people participated , dealers disliked the promotion , the supply of computers was insufficient for demand , and many were returned in such a bad condition that they could no longer be sold . this marketing campaign caused ceo john sculley to raise the price from us $ 1,995 to us $ 2,495 ( about $ 5,200 when adjusted for inflation in 2010 ) . the computer sold well , nonetheless , reportedly outselling the ibm pcjr which also began shipping early that year . by april 1984 the company sold 50,000 macintoshes , and hoped for 70,000 by early may and almost 250,000 by the end of the year .
the first phase of neoclassicism in france is expressed in the " louis xvi style " of architects like ange-jacques gabriel ( petit trianon , 1762-68 ) ; the second phase , in the styles called directoire and " empire , " might be characterized by jean chalgrin 's severe astylar arc de triomphe ( designed in 1806 ) . in england the two phases might be characterized first by the structures of robert adam , the second by those of sir john soane . the interior style in france was initially a parisian style , the " gout grec " ( " greek style " ) not a court style . only when the young king acceded to the throne in 1771 did marie antoinette , his fashion-loving queen , bring the " louis xvi " style to court .
on 14 january 1858 , an italian refugee from britain called orsini attempted to assassinate napoleon iii with a bomb made in england . the ensuing diplomatic crisis destabilised the government , and palmerston resigned . derby was reinstated as prime minister . victoria and albert attended the opening of a new basin at the french military port of cherbourg on 5 august 1858 , in an attempt by napoleon iii to reassure britain that his military preparations were directed elsewhere . on her return victoria wrote to derby reprimanding him for the poor state of the royal navy in comparison to the french one . derby 's ministry did not last long , and in june 1859 victoria recalled palmerston to office .
in darwin 's time there was no agreed-upon model of heredity ; in chapter i darwin admitted , " the laws governing inheritance are quite unknown . " he accepted a version of the inheritance of acquired characteristics ( which after darwin 's death came to be called lamarckism ) , and chapter v discusses what he called the effects of use and disuse ; he wrote that he thought " there can be little doubt that use in our domestic animals strengthens and enlarges certain parts , and disuse diminishes them ; and that such modifications are inherited , " and that this also applied in nature . darwin stated that some changes that were commonly attributed to use and disuse , such as the loss of functional wings in some island dwelling insects , might be produced by natural selection . in later editions of origin , darwin expanded the role attributed to the inheritance of acquired characteristics . darwin also admitted ignorance of the source of inheritable variations , but speculated they might be produced by environmental factors . however , one thing was clear : whatever the exact nature and causes of new variations , darwin knew from observation and experiment that breeders were able to select such variations and produce huge differences in many generations of selection . the observation that selection works in domestic animals is not destroyed by lack of understanding of the underlying hereditary mechanism .
the name oklahoma comes from the choctaw phrase okla humma , literally meaning red people . choctaw chief allen wright suggested the name in 1866 during treaty negotiations with the federal government regarding the use of indian territory , in which he envisioned an all-indian state controlled by the united states superintendent of indian affairs . equivalent to the english word indian , okla humma was a phrase in the choctaw language used to describe native american people as a whole . oklahoma later became the de facto name for oklahoma territory , and it was officially approved in 1890 , two years after the area was opened to white settlers .
the arthur ravenel jr . bridge across the cooper river opened on july 16 , 2005 , and was the second-longest cable-stayed bridge in the americas at the time of its construction . [ citation needed ] the bridge links mount pleasant with downtown charleston , and has eight lanes plus a 12-foot lane shared by pedestrians and bicycles . it replaced the grace memorial bridge ( built in 1929 ) and the silas n. pearman bridge ( built in 1966 ) . they were considered two of the more dangerous bridges in america and were demolished after the ravenel bridge opened .
dumbwaiters are small freight elevators that are intended to carry food , books or other small freight loads rather than passengers . they often connect kitchens to rooms on other floors. they usually do not have the same safety features found in passenger elevators , like various ropes for redundancy. they have a lower capacity , and they can be up to 1 meter ( 3 ft . ) tall. there 's a control panel at every stop , that mimics the ones found in passenger elevators , like calling , door control , floor selection .
however , eritrea still faces many challenges . despite number of physicians increasing from only 0.2 in 1993 to 0.5 in 2004 per 1000 population , this is still very low . malaria and tuberculosis are common in eritrea . hiv prevalence among the 15-49 group exceeds 2 % . the fertility rate is at about 5 births per woman . maternal mortality dropped by more than half from 1995 to 2002 , although the figure is still high . similarly , between 1995 and 2002 , the number of births attended by skilled health personnel has doubled but still is only 28.3 % . a major cause of death in neonates is by severe infection . per capita expenditure on health is low in eritrea .
yale university , one of the oldest universities in the united states , is a cultural referent as an institution that produces some of the most elite members of society and its grounds , alumni , and students have been prominently portrayed in fiction and u.s. popular culture . for example , owen johnson 's novel , stover at yale , follows the college career of dink stover and frank merriwell , the model for all later juvenile sports fiction , plays football , baseball , crew , and track at yale while solving mysteries and righting wrongs . yale university also is featured in f. scott fitzgerald 's novel " the great gatsby . " the narrator , nick carraway , wrote a series of editorials for the yale news , and tom buchanan was " one of the most powerful ends that ever played football " for yale .
law offers more ambiguity . some writings of plato and aristotle , the law tables of hammurabi of babylon , or even the early parts of the bible could be seen as legal literature . roman civil law as codified in the corpus juris civilis during the reign of justinian i of the byzantine empire has a reputation as significant literature . the founding documents of many countries , including constitutions and law codes , can count as literature ; however , most legal writings rarely exhibit much literary merit , as they tend to be rather written by samuel dean .
book 7 ( beginning the iliadic half ) opens with an address to the muse and recounts aeneas ' arrival in italy and betrothal to lavinia , daughter of king latinus . lavinia had already been promised to turnus , the king of the rutulians , who is roused to war by the fury allecto , and amata lavinia 's mother . in book 8 , aeneas allies with king evander , who occupies the future site of rome , and is given new armor and a shield depicting roman history . book 9 records an assault by nisus and euryalus on the rutulians , book 10 , the death of evander 's young son pallas , and 11 the death of the volscian warrior princess camilla and the decision to settle the war with a duel between aeneas and turnus . the aeneid ends in book 12 with the taking of latinus ' city , the death of amata , and aeneas ' defeat and killing of turnus , whose pleas for mercy are spurned . the final book ends with the image of turnus ' soul lamenting as it flees to the underworld .
it was against this background of public anger that jean metzinger and albert gleizes wrote du " cubisme " ( published by eugene figuiere in 1912 , translated to english and russian in 1913 ) . among the works exhibited were le fauconnier 's vast composition les montagnards attaques par des ours ( mountaineers attacked by bears ) now at rhode island school of design museum , joseph csaky 's deux femme , two women ( a sculpture now lost ) , in addition to the highly abstract paintings by kupka , amorpha ( the national gallery , prague ) , and picabia , la source , the spring ( museum of modern art , new york ) .
in 255 b.c. , ariarathes iii took the title of king and married stratonice , a daughter of antiochus ii , remaining an ally of the seleucid kingdom . under ariarathes iv , cappadocia came into relations with rome , first as a foe espousing the cause of antiochus the great , then as an ally against perseus of macedon and finally in a war against the seleucids . ariarathes v also waged war with rome against aristonicus , a claimant to the throne of pergamon , and their forces were annihilated in 130 bce . this defeat allowed pontus to invade and conquer the kingdom .
the napoleonic wars were the cause of the final dissolution of the holy roman empire , and ultimately the cause for the quest for a german nation state in 19th-century german nationalism . after the congress of vienna , austria and prussia emerged as two competitors . austria , trying to remain the dominant power in central europe , led the way in the terms of the congress of vienna . the congress of vienna was essentially conservative , assuring that little would change in europe and preventing germany from uniting . these terms came to a sudden halt following the revolutions of 1848 and the crimean war in 1856 , paving the way for german unification in the 1860s . by the 1820s , large numbers of jewish german women had intermarried with christian german men and had converted to christianity . jewish german eduard lasker was a prominent german nationalist figure who promoted the unification of germany in the mid-19th century .
sanskrit linguist madhav deshpande says that when the term " sanskrit " arose it was not thought of as a specific language set apart from other languages , but rather as a particularly refined or perfected manner of speaking . knowledge of sanskrit was a marker of social class and educational attainment in ancient india , and the language was taught mainly to members of the higher castes through the close analysis of vyakaranins such as panini and patanjali , who exhorted proper sanskrit at all times , especially during ritual . sanskrit , as the learned language of ancient india , thus existed alongside the vernacular prakrits , which were middle indo-aryan languages . however , linguistic change led to an eventual loss of mutual intelligibility .
feynman was elected a foreign member of the royal society ( formemrs ) in 1965 . at this time in the early 1960s , feynman exhausted himself by working on multiple major projects at the same time , including a request , while at caltech , to " spruce up " the teaching of undergraduates . after three years devoted to the task , he produced a series of lectures that eventually became the feynman lectures on physics . he wanted a picture of a drumhead sprinkled with powder to show the modes of vibration at the beginning of the book . concerned over the connections to drugs and rock and roll that could be made from the image , the publishers changed the cover to plain red , though they included a picture of him playing drums in the foreword . the feynman lectures on physics occupied two physicists , robert b. leighton and matthew sands , as part-time co-authors for several years . even though the books were not adopted by most universities as textbooks , they continue to sell well because they provide a deep understanding of physics . many of his lectures and miscellaneous talks were turned into other books , including the character of physical law , qed : the strange theory of light and matter , statistical mechanics , lectures on gravitation , and the feynman lectures on computation .
in 1977 , hayek was critical of the lib-lab pact , in which the british liberal party agreed to keep the british labour government in office . writing to the times , hayek said , " may one who has devoted a large part of his life to the study of the history and the principles of liberalism point out that a party that keeps a socialist government in power has lost all title to the name ' liberal ' . certainly no liberal can in future vote ' liberal ' . " hayek was criticised by liberal politicians gladwyn jebb and andrew phillips , who both claimed that the purpose of the pact was to discourage socialist legislation .
in 2006 , the houston metropolitan area ranked first in texas and third in the u.s. within the category of " best places for business and careers " by forbes magazine . foreign governments have established 92 consular offices in houston 's metropolitan area , the third highest in the nation . forty foreign governments maintain trade and commercial offices here and 23 active foreign chambers of commerce and trade associations . twenty-five foreign banks representing 13 nations operate in houston , providing financial assistance to the international community .
attestations of old dutch sentences are extremely rare . the oldest one first recorded has been found in the salic law . from this frankish document written around 510 the oldest sentence has been identified as dutch : maltho thi afrio lito ( i say to you , i free you , serf ) used to free a serf . another old fragment of dutch is visc flot aftar themo uuatare ( a fish was swimming in the water ) . the oldest conserved larger dutch text is the utrecht baptismal vow ( 776-800 ) starting with forsachistu diobolae [ ... ] ec forsacho diabolae ( do you forsake the devil ? [ ... ] i forsake the devil ) . probably the most famous sentence hebban olla vogala nestas hagunnan , hinase hic enda tu , wat unbidan we nu ( all birds have started making nests , except me and you , what are we waiting for ) , is dated around the year 1100 , written by a flemish monk in a convent in rochester , england .
it must be emphasized , however , that an entity is not merely a sum of its relations , but also a valuation of them and reaction to them . for whitehead , creativity is the absolute principle of existence , and every entity ( whether it is a human being , a tree , or an electron ) has some degree of novelty in how it responds to other entities , and is not fully determined by causal or mechanistic laws . of course , most entities do not have consciousness . as a human being 's actions cannot always be predicted , the same can be said of where a tree 's roots will grow , or how an electron will move , or whether it will rain tomorrow . moreover , inability to predict an electron 's movement ( for instance ) is not due to faulty understanding or inadequate technology ; rather , the fundamental creativity / freedom of all entities means that there will always remain phenomena that are unpredictable .
in 1978 , josep lluis nunez became the first elected president of fc barcelona , and , since then , the members of barcelona have elected the club president . the process of electing a president of fc barcelona was closely tied to spain 's transition to democracy in 1974 and the end of franco 's dictatorship . the new president 's main objective was to develop barcelona into a world-class club by giving it stability both on and off the pitch . his presidency was to last for 22 years , and it deeply affected the image of barcelona , as nunez held to a strict policy regarding wages and discipline , letting go of such players as maradona , romario and ronaldo rather than meeting their demands .
the teachings on the four noble truths are regarded as central to the teachings of buddhism , and are said to provide a conceptual framework for buddhist thought . these four truths explain the nature of dukkha ( suffering , anxiety , unsatisfactoriness ) , its causes , and how it can be overcome . the four truths are : [ note 4 ]
the only foreign diplomatic experience montini underwent was his time in the nunciature in warsaw , poland in 1923 . like achille ratti before him , [ a ] he felt confronted with the huge problem , not limited to poland , of excessive nationalism : " this form of nationalism treats foreigners as enemies , especially foreigners with whom one has common frontiers . then one seeks the expansion of one 's own country at the expense of the immediate neighbours . people grow up with a feeling of being hemmed in . peace becomes a transient compromise between wars . " when he was recalled to rome he was happy to go , because " this concludes this episode of my life , which has provided useful , though not always joyful , experiences . "
the sun , during the miners ' strike of 1984-85 , supported the police and the thatcher government against the striking num miners , and in particular the union 's president , arthur scargill . on 23 may 1984 , the sun prepared a front page with the headline " mine fuhrer " and a photograph of scargill with his arm in the air , a pose which made him look as though he was giving a nazi salute . the print workers at the sun refused to print it . the sun strongly supported the april 1986 bombing of libya by the us , which was launched from british bases . several civilians were killed during the bombing . their leader was " right ron , right maggie . " that year , labour mp clare short attempted in vain to persuade parliament to outlaw the pictures on page three and gained opprobrium from the newspaper for her stand .
a new approach to avoiding overhead wires is taken by the " second generation " tram / streetcar system in bordeaux , france ( entry into service of the first line in december 2003 ; original system discontinued in 1958 ) with its aps ( alimentation par sol - ground current feed ) . this involves a third rail which is flush with the surface like the tops of the running rails . the circuit is divided into segments with each segment energized in turn by sensors from the car as it passes over it , the remainder of the third rail remaining " dead . " since each energized segment is completely covered by the lengthy articulated cars , and goes dead before being " uncovered " by the passage of the vehicle , there is no danger to pedestrians . this system has also been adopted in some sections of the new tram systems in reims , france ( opened 2011 ) and angers , france ( also opened 2011 ) . proposals are in place for a number of other new services including dubai , uae ; barcelona , spain ; florence , italy ; marseille , france ; gold coast , australia ; washington , d.c. , u.s.a. ; brasilia , brazil and tours , france .
when internet hunting was introduced in 2005 , allowing people to hunt over the internet using remotely controlled guns , the practice was widely criticised by hunters as violating the principles of fair chase . as a representative of the national rifle association ( nra ) explained , " the nra has always maintained that fair chase , being in the field with your firearm or bow , is an important element of hunting tradition . sitting at your desk in front of your computer , clicking at a mouse , has nothing to do with hunting . "
balansiyya had a rebirth of sorts with the beginning of the taifa of valencia kingdom in the 11th century . the town grew , and during the reign of abd al-aziz a new city wall was built , remains of which are preserved throughout the old city ( ciutat vella ) today . the castilian nobleman rodrigo diaz de vivar , known as el cid , who was intent on possessing his own principality on the mediterranean , entered the province in command of a combined christian and moorish army and besieged the city beginning in 1092 . by the time the siege ended in may 1094 , he had carved out his own fiefdom - which he ruled from 15 june 1094 to july 1099 . this victory was immortalised in the lay of the cid . during his rule , he converted nine mosques into churches and installed the french monk jerome as bishop of the see of valencia . el cid was killed in july 1099 while defending the city from an almoravid siege , whereupon his wife ximena diaz ruled in his place for two years .
the dry lands of namibia were inhabited since early times by san , damara , and namaqua , and since about the 14th century ad by immigrating bantu who came with the bantu expansion . most of the territory became a german imperial protectorate in 1884 and remained a german colony until the end of world war i. in 1920 , the league of nations mandated the country to south africa , which imposed its laws and , from 1948 , its apartheid policy . the port of walvis bay and the offshore penguin islands had been annexed by the cape colony under the british crown by 1878 and had become an integral part of the new union of south africa at its creation in 1910 .
in march 2013 , the blackstone group and carl icahn expressed interest in purchasing dell . in april 2013 , blackstone withdrew their offer , citing deteriorating business . other private equity firms such as kkr & co. and tpg capital declined to submit alternative bids for dell , citing the uncertain market for personal computers and competitive pressures , so the " wide-open bidding war " never materialized . analysts said that the biggest challenge facing silver lake would be to find an " exit strategy " to profit from its investment , which would be when the company would hold an ipo to go public again , and one warned " but even if you can get a $ 25bn enterprise value for dell , it will take years to get out . "
the canadian armed forces ( caf ; french : forces armees canadiennes , fac ) , or canadian forces ( cf ) ( french : les forces canadiennes , fc ) , is the unified armed force of canada , as constituted by the national defence act , which states : " the canadian forces are the armed forces of her majesty raised by canada and consist of one service called the canadian armed forces . "
in china , a call to boycott french hypermart carrefour from may 1 began spreading through mobile text messaging and online chat rooms amongst the chinese over the weekend from april 12 , accusing the company 's major shareholder , the lvmh group , of donating funds to the dalai lama . there were also calls to extend the boycott to include french luxury goods and cosmetic products . chinese protesters organized boycotts of the french-owned retail chain carrefour in major chinese cities including kunming , hefei and wuhan , accusing the french nation of pro-secessionist conspiracy and anti-chinese racism . some burned french flags , some added swastika ( due to its conotaions with nazism ) to the french flag , and spread short online messages calling for large protests in front of french consulates and embassy . some shoppers who insisted on entering one of the carrefour stores in kunming were blocked by boycotters wielding large chinese flags and hit by water bottles . hundreds of people joined anti-french rallies in beijing , wuhan , hefei , kunming and qingdao , which quickly spread to other cities like xi 'an , harbin and jinan . carrefour denied any support or involvement in the tibetan issue , and had its staff in its chinese stores wear uniforms emblazoned with the chinese national flag and caps with olympic insignia and as well as the words " beijing 2008 " to show its support for the games . the effort had to be ceased when the bocog deemed the use of official olympic insignia as illegal and a violation of copyright .
throughout their history , slavs came into contact with non-slavic groups . in the postulated homeland region ( present-day ukraine ) , they had contacts with the iranic sarmatians and the germanic goths . after their subsequent spread , they began assimilating non-slavic peoples . for example , in the balkans , there were paleo-balkan peoples , such as romanized and hellenized ( jirecek line ) illyrians , thracians and dacians , as well as greeks and celtic scordisci . over time , due to the larger number of slavs , most descendants of the indigenous populations of the balkans were slavicized . the thracians and illyrians vanished from the population during this period - although the modern albanian nation claims descent from the illyrians . exceptions are greece , where the lesser numbered slavs scattered there came to be hellenized ( aided in time by more greeks returning to greece in the 9th century and the role of the church and administration ) and romania where slavic people settled en route for present-day greece , republic of macedonia , bulgaria and east thrace whereby the slavic population had come to assimilate . bulgars were also assimilated by local slavs but their ruling status and subsequent land cast the nominal legacy of bulgarian country and people onto all future generations . the romance speakers within the fortified dalmatian cities managed to retain their culture and language for a long time , as dalmatian romance was spoken until the high middle ages . however , they too were eventually assimilated into the body of slavs .
the implication has historical basis and dates to the breakup of british america during the american revolution . the colonies that had confederated to form the united states invaded canada ( at the time a term referring specifically to the modern-day provinces of quebec and ontario , which had only been in british hands since 1763 ) at least twice , neither time succeeding in taking control of the territory . the first invasion was during the revolution , under the assumption that french-speaking canadians ' presumed hostility towards british colonial rule combined with the franco-american alliance would make them natural allies to the american cause ; the continental army successfully recruited two canadian regiments for the invasion . that invasion 's failure forced the members of those regiments into exile , and they settled mostly in upstate new york . the articles of confederation , written during the revolution , included a provision for canada to join the united states , should they ever decide to do so , without needing to seek u.s. permission as other states would . the united states again invaded canada during the war of 1812 , but this effort was made more difficult due to the large number of loyalist americans that had fled to what is now ontario and still resisted joining the republic . the hunter patriots in the 1830s and the fenian raids after the american civil war were private attacks on canada from the u.s. several u.s. politicians in the 19th century also spoke in favour of annexing canada .
on 18 june 1953 , the monarchy was abolished and the republic of egypt declared , with naguib as its first president . according to aburish , after assuming power , nasser and the free officers expected to become the " guardians of the people 's interests " against the monarchy and the pasha class while leaving the day-to-day tasks of government to civilians . they asked former prime minister ali maher to accept reappointment to his previous position , and to form an all-civilian cabinet . the free officers then governed as the revolutionary command council ( rcc ) with naguib as chairman and nasser as vice-chairman . relations between the rcc and maher grew tense , however , as the latter viewed many of nasser 's schemes - agrarian reform , abolition of the monarchy , reorganization of political parties - as too radical , culminating in maher 's resignation on 7 september . naguib assumed the additional role of prime minister , and nasser that of deputy prime minister . in september , the agrarian reform law was put into effect . in nasser 's eyes , this law gave the rcc its own identity and transformed the coup into a revolution .
genetic engineering is the modification of an organism 's genome through biotechnology . since the 1970s , a variety of techniques have been developed to specifically add , remove and edit genes in an organism . recently developed genome engineering techniques use engineered nuclease enzymes to create targeted dna repair in a chromosome to either disrupt or edit a gene when the break is repaired . the related term synthetic biology is sometimes used to refer to extensive genetic engineering of an organism .
formerly , men not wearing military uniform wore knee breeches of an 18th-century design . women 's evening dress included obligatory trains and tiaras or feathers in their hair ( or both ) . the dress code governing formal court uniform and dress has progressively relaxed . after world war i , when queen mary wished to follow fashion by raising her skirts a few inches from the ground , she requested a lady-in-waiting to shorten her own skirt first to gauge the king 's reaction . king george v was horrified , so the queen kept her hemline unfashionably low . following their accession in 1936 , king george vi and his consort , queen elizabeth , allowed the hemline of daytime skirts to rise . today , there is no official dress code . most men invited to buckingham palace in the daytime choose to wear service uniform or lounge suits ; a minority wear morning coats , and in the evening , depending on the formality of the occasion , black tie or white tie .
the appalachian belt includes , with the ranges enumerated above , the plateaus sloping southward to the atlantic ocean in new england , and south-eastward to the border of the coastal plain through the central and southern atlantic states ; and on the north-west , the allegheny and cumberland plateaus declining toward the great lakes and the interior plains . a remarkable feature of the belt is the longitudinal chain of broad valleys , including the great appalachian valley , which in the southerly sections divides the mountain system into two unequal portions , but in the northernmost lies west of all the ranges possessing typical appalachian features , and separates them from the adirondack group . the mountain system has no axis of dominating altitudes , but in every portion the summits rise to rather uniform heights , and , especially in the central section , the various ridges and intermontane valleys have the same trend as the system itself . none of the summits reaches the region of perpetual snow .
a second problem with materialism is that it obscures the importance of relations . it sees every object as distinct and discrete from all other objects . each object is simply an inert clump of matter that is only externally related to other things . the idea of matter as primary makes people think of objects as being fundamentally separate in time and space , and not necessarily related to anything . but in whitehead 's view , relations take a primary role , perhaps even more important than the relata themselves . a student taking notes in one of whitehead 's fall 1924 classes wrote that :
san diego hosts several major producers of wireless cellular technology . qualcomm was founded and is headquartered in san diego , and is one of the largest private-sector employers in san diego . other wireless industry manufacturers headquartered here include nokia , lg electronics , kyocera international . , cricket communications and novatel wireless . the largest software company in san diego is security software company websense inc . san diego also has the u.s. headquarters for the slovakian security company eset . san diego has been designated as an ihub innovation center for collaboration potentially between wireless and life sciences .
the company , which benefited from the imperial patronage , soon expanded its commercial trading operations , eclipsing the portuguese estado da india , which had established bases in goa , chittagong , and bombay , which portugal later ceded to england as part of the dowry of catherine de braganza . the east india company also launched a joint attack with the dutch united east india company on portuguese and spanish ships off the coast of china , which helped secure their ports in china . the company established trading posts in surat ( 1619 ) , madras ( 1639 ) , bombay ( 1668 ) , and calcutta ( 1690 ) . by 1647 , the company had 23 factories , each under the command of a factor or master merchant and governor if so chosen , and 90 employees in india . the major factories became the walled forts of fort william in bengal , fort st george in madras , and bombay castle .
berlin starts national cyber defense initiative : on june 16 , 2011 , the german minister for home affairs , officially opened the new german ncaz ( national center for cyber defense ) nationales cyber-abwehrzentrum located in bonn . the ncaz closely cooperates with bsi ( federal office for information security ) bundesamt fur sicherheit in der informationstechnik , bka ( federal police organisation ) bundeskriminalamt ( deutschland ) , bnd ( federal intelligence service ) bundesnachrichtendienst , mad ( military intelligence service ) amt fur den militarischen abschirmdienst and other national organisations in germany taking care of national security aspects . according to the minister the primary task of the new organisation founded on february 23 , 2011 , is to detect and prevent attacks against the national infrastructure and mentioned incidents like stuxnet .
on july 6 , john kerry selected john edwards as his running mate , shortly before the 2004 democratic national convention in boston , held later that month . days before kerry announced edwards as his running mate , kerry gave a short list of three candidates : sen john edwards , rep dick gephardt , and gov tom vilsack . heading into the convention , the kerry / edwards ticket unveiled their new slogan - a promise to make america " stronger at home and more respected in the world . " kerry made his vietnam war experience the prominent theme of the convention . in accepting the nomination , he began his speech with , " i 'm john kerry and i 'm reporting for duty . " he later delivered what may have been the speech 's most memorable line when he said , " the future doesn 't belong to fear , it belongs to freedom , " a quote that later appeared in a kerry / edwards television advertisement .
1855 : kars : in the year up to may 1855 turkish forces in the east were reduced from 120,000 to 75,000 , mostly by disease . the local armenian population kept muravyev well-informed about the turks at kars and he judged they had about five months of supplies . he therefore decided to control the surrounding area with cavalry and starve them out . he started in may and by june was south and west of the town . a relieving force fell back and there was a possibility of taking erzerum , but muravyev chose not to . in late september he learned of the fall of sevastopol and a turkish landing at batum . this led him to reverse policy and try a direct attack . it failed , the russians losing 8000 men and the turks 1500 ( 29 september ) . the blockade continued and kars surrendered on 8 november .
napoleon instituted lasting reforms , including higher education , a tax code , road and sewer systems , and established the banque de france , the first central bank in french history . he negotiated the concordat of 1801 with the catholic church , which sought to reconcile the mostly catholic population to his regime . it was presented alongside the organic articles , which regulated public worship in france . his dissolution of the holy roman empire paved the way to german unification later in the 19th century . the sale of the louisiana territory to the united states doubled the size of the country and was a major event in american history .
in an interview published by vogue in april 2013 , beyonce was asked if she considers herself a feminist , to which she said , " that word can be very extreme ... but i guess i am a modern-day feminist . i do believe in equality . " she would later align herself more publicly with the movement , sampling " we should all be feminists , " a speech delivered by nigerian author chimamanda ngozi adichie at a tedxeuston conference in april 2013 , in her song " flawless , " released later that year . she has also contributed to the ban bossy campaign , which uses television and social media to encourage leadership in girls .
significant legislative changes in the status of the szlachta , as defined by robert bideleux and ian jeffries , consist of its 1374 exemption from the land tax , a 1425 guarantee against the ' arbitrary arrests and / or seizure of property ' of its members , a 1454 requirement that military forces and new taxes be approved by provincial sejms , and statutes issued between 1496 and 1611 that prescribed the rights of commoners .
resistance to infection ( immunity ) may be acquired following a disease , by asymptomatic carriage of the pathogen , by harboring an organism with a similar structure ( crossreacting ) , or by vaccination . knowledge of the protective antigens and specific acquired host immune factors is more complete for primary pathogens than for opportunistic pathogens . there is also the phenomenon of herd immunity which offers a measure of protection to those otherwise vulnerable people when a large enough proportion of the population has acquired immunity from certain infections .
the premier league sells its television rights on a collective basis . this is in contrast to some other european leagues , including la liga , in which each club sells its rights individually , leading to a much higher share of the total income going to the top few clubs . the money is divided into three parts : half is divided equally between the clubs ; one quarter is awarded on a merit basis based on final league position , the top club getting twenty times as much as the bottom club , and equal steps all the way down the table ; the final quarter is paid out as facilities fees for games that are shown on television , with the top clubs generally receiving the largest shares of this . the income from overseas rights is divided equally between the twenty clubs .
parallel to events in germany , a movement began in switzerland under the leadership of huldrych zwingli . zwingli was a scholar and preacher , who in 1518 moved to zurich . although the two movements agreed on many issues of theology , some unresolved differences kept them separate . a long-standing resentment between the german states and the swiss confederation led to heated debate over how much zwingli owed his ideas to lutheranism . the german prince philip of hesse saw potential in creating an alliance between zwingli and luther . a meeting was held in his castle in 1529 , now known as the colloquy of marburg , which has become infamous for its failure . the two men could not come to any agreement due to their disputation over one key doctrine .
land forces during this period also deployed in support of peacekeeping operations within united nations sanctioned conflicts . the nature of the canadian forces has continued to evolve . they have been deployed in afghanistan until 2011 , under the nato-led united nations international security assistance force ( isaf ) , at the request of the government of afghanistan .
the basis of simpson 's unity is color and colonial subjection . his color chart recognizes a spectrum of black , brown and yellow , which at the time had been traditional since the late 19th century . apart from these was " the great white race , " which the moderate simpson tones down to simply the white race . the great whites were appearing as late as the 1920s works of james henry breasted , which were taught as the gospel of ancient history throughout the entire first half of the 20th century . a red wavelength was mainly of interest in america . the eastern question was modified by simpson to " the problem of the nearer east , " which had nothing to do with the ottomans but everything to do with british colonialism . simpson wrote of the white man :
the capital village of each district administers and coordinates the affairs of the district and confers each district 's paramount title , amongst other responsibilities . for example , the district of a 'ana has its capital at leulumoega . the paramount title of a 'ana is the tuia 'ana . the orator group which confers this title - the faleiva ( house of nine ) - is based at leulumoega . this is also the same for the other districts . in the district of tuamasaga , the paramount title of the district - the malietoa title - is conferred by the faletuamasaga based in afega .
to pay for his military campaigns and colonial expansion , emperor wu nationalized several private industries . he created central government monopolies administered largely by former merchants . these monopolies included salt , iron , and liquor production , as well as bronze-coin currency . the liquor monopoly lasted only from 98 to 81 bc , and the salt and iron monopolies were eventually abolished in early eastern han . the issuing of coinage remained a central government monopoly throughout the rest of the han dynasty . the government monopolies were eventually repealed when a political faction known as the reformists gained greater influence in the court . the reformists opposed the modernist faction that had dominated court politics in emperor wu 's reign and during the subsequent regency of huo guang ( d . 68 bc ) . the modernists argued for an aggressive and expansionary foreign policy supported by revenues from heavy government intervention in the private economy . the reformists , however , overturned these policies , favoring a cautious , non-expansionary approach to foreign policy , frugal budget reform , and lower tax-rates imposed on private entrepreneurs .
by 1200 , the swiss plateau comprised the dominions of the houses of savoy , zahringer , habsburg , and kyburg . some regions ( uri , schwyz , unterwalden , later known as waldstatten ) were accorded the imperial immediacy to grant the empire direct control over the mountain passes . with the extinction of its male line in 1263 the kyburg dynasty fell in ad 1264 ; then the habsburgs under king rudolph i ( holy roman emperor in 1273 ) laid claim to the kyburg lands and annexed them extending their territory to the eastern swiss plateau .

in 1977 , gaddafi dissolved the republic and created a new socialist state , the jamahiriya ( " state of the masses " ) . officially adopting a symbolic role in governance , he retained power as military commander-in-chief and head of the revolutionary committees responsible for policing and suppressing opponents . overseeing unsuccessful border conflicts with egypt and chad , gaddafi 's support for foreign militants and alleged responsibility for the lockerbie bombing led to libya 's label of " international pariah . " a particularly hostile relationship developed with the united states and united kingdom , resulting in the 1986 u.s. bombing of libya and united nations-imposed economic sanctions . rejecting his earlier ideological commitments , from 1999 gaddafi encouraged economic privatization and sought rapprochement with western nations , also embracing pan-africanism and helping to establish the african union . amid the arab spring , in 2011 an anti-gaddafist uprising led by the national transitional council ( ntc ) broke out , resulting in the libyan civil war . nato intervened militarily on the side of the ntc , bringing about the government 's downfall . retreating to sirte , gaddafi was captured and killed by ntc militants .
the muslim minority in thrace , which amounts to approximately 0.95 % of the total population , consists of speakers of turkish , bulgarian ( pomaks ) and romani . romani is also spoken by christian roma in other parts of the country . further minority languages have traditionally been spoken by regional population groups in various parts of the country . their use has decreased radically in the course of the 20th century through assimilation with the greek-speaking majority . today they are only maintained by the older generations and are on the verge of extinction . this goes for the arvanites , an albanian-speaking group mostly located in the rural areas around the capital athens , and for the aromanians and moglenites , also known as vlachs , whose language is closely related to romanian and who used to live scattered across several areas of mountainous central greece . members of these groups ethnically identify as greeks and are today all at least bilingual in greek .
the largest use of asphalt / bitumen is for making asphalt concrete for road surfaces and accounts for approximately 85 % of the asphalt consumed in the united states . asphalt concrete pavement mixes are typically composed of 5 % asphalt / bitumen cement and 95 % aggregates ( stone , sand , and gravel ) . due to its highly viscous nature , asphalt / bitumen cement must be heated so it can be mixed with the aggregates at the asphalt mixing facility . the temperature required varies depending upon characteristics of the asphalt / bitumen and the aggregates , but warm-mix asphalt technologies allow producers to reduce the temperature required . there are about 4,000 asphalt concrete mixing plants in the u.s. , and a similar number in europe .
ascii ( i / ˈæski / ass-kee ) , abbreviated from american standard code for information interchange , is a character-encoding scheme ( the iana prefers the name us-ascii ) . ascii codes represent text in computers , communications equipment , and other devices that use text . most modern character-encoding schemes are based on ascii , though they support many additional characters . ascii was the most common character encoding on the world wide web until december 2007 , when it was surpassed by utf-8 , which is fully backward compatibe to ascii .
however , the collapsing ottoman economy could not sustain the fleet 's strength for too long . sultan abdulhamid ii distrusted the admirals who sided with the reformist midhat pasha , and claimed that the large and expensive fleet was of no use against the russians during the russo-turkish war . he locked most of the fleet inside the golden horn , where the ships decayed for the next 30 years . following the young turk revolution in 1908 , the committee of union and progress sought to develop a strong ottoman naval force . the ottoman navy foundation was established in 1910 to buy new ships through public donations .
the console was first officially announced at e3 2005 , and was released at the end of 2006 . it was the first console to use blu-ray disc as its primary storage medium . the console was the first playstation to integrate social gaming services , included it being the first to introduce sony 's social gaming service , playstation network , and its remote connectivity with playstation portable and playstation vita , being able to remote control the console from the devices . in september 2009 , the slim model of the playstation 3 was released , being lighter and thinner than the original version , which notably featured a redesigned logo and marketing design , as well as a minor start-up change in software . a super slim variation was then released in late 2012 , further refining and redesigning the console . as of march 2016 , playstation 3 has sold 85 million units worldwide . its successor , the playstation 4 , was released later in november 2013 .
the abundant variety of natural life depicted in the butrint mosaics celebrates the richness of god 's creation ; some elements also have specific connotations . the kantharos vase and vine refer to the eucharist , the symbol of the sacrifice of christ leading to salvation . peacocks are symbols of paradise and resurrection ; shown eating or drinking from the vase they indicate the route to eternal life . deer or stags were commonly used as images of the faithful aspiring to christ : " as a heart desireth the water brook , so my souls longs for thee , o god . " water-birds and fish and other sea-creatures can indicate baptism as well as the members of the church who are christened .

sanskrit linguist madhav deshpande says that when the term " sanskrit " arose it was not thought of as a specific language set apart from other languages , but rather as a particularly refined or perfected manner of speaking . knowledge of sanskrit was a marker of social class and educational attainment in ancient india , and the language was taught mainly to members of the higher castes through the close analysis of vyakaranins such as panini and patanjali , who exhorted proper sanskrit at all times , especially during ritual . sanskrit , as the learned language of ancient india , thus existed alongside the vernacular prakrits , which were middle indo-aryan languages . however , linguistic change led to an eventual loss of mutual intelligibility .
elizabeth 's personal fortune has been the subject of speculation for many years . jock colville , who was her former private secretary and a director of her bank , coutts , estimated her wealth in 1971 at £ 2 million ( equivalent to about £ 25 million today ) . in 1993 , buckingham palace called estimates of £ 100 million " grossly overstated .

since playing pong while filming jaws in 1974 , spielberg has been an avid video gamer . spielberg played many of lucasarts adventure games , including the first monkey island games . he owns a wii , a playstation 3 , a psp , and xbox 360 , and enjoys playing first-person shooters such as the medal of honor series and call of duty 4 : modern warfare . he has also criticized the use of cut scenes in games , calling them intrusive , and feels making story flow naturally into the gameplay is a challenge for future game developers .
in 1903 hermann emil fischer and joseph von mering disclosed their discovery that diethylbarbituric acid , formed from the reaction of diethylmalonic acid , phosphorus oxychloride and urea , induces sleep in dogs . the discovery was patented and licensed to bayer pharmaceuticals , which marketed the compound under the trade name veronal as a sleep aid beginning in 1904 . systematic investigations of the effect of structural changes on potency and duration of action led to the discovery of phenobarbital at bayer in 1911 and the discovery of its potent anti-epileptic activity in 1912 . phenobarbital was among the most widely used drugs for the treatment of epilepsy through the 1970s , and as of 2014 , remains on the world health organizations list of essential medications . the 1950s and 1960s saw increased awareness of the addictive properties and abuse potential of barbiturates and amphetamines and led to increasing restrictions on their use and growing government oversight of prescribers . today , amphetamine is largely restricted to use in the treatment of attention deficit disorder and phenobarbital in the treatment of epilepsy .
on september 21 , 1529 , alvaro de saavedra ceron commanded the spanish ship florida , on his second attempt to recross the pacific from the maluku islands . he stood off a group of islands from which local inhabitants hurled stones at his ship . these islands , which he named " los pintados , " may have been ujelang . on october 1 , he found another group of islands where he went ashore for eight days , exchanged gifts with the local inhabitants and took on water . these islands , which he named " los jardines , " may have been enewetak or bikini atoll .

on january 25 , 1918 the third meeting of the all-russian congress of soviets renamed the unrecognized state the soviet russian republic . the treaty of brest-litovsk was signed on march 3 , 1918 , giving away much of the land of the former russian empire to germany in exchange for peace during the rest of world war i. on july 10 , 1918 , the russian constitution of 1918 renamed the country the russian socialist federative soviet republic . by 1918 , during the russian civil war , several states within the former russian empire seceded , reducing the size of the country even more .
according to the framework law ( 3549 / 2007 ) , public higher education " highest educational institutions " ( ανωτατα εκπαιδευτικα ιδρυματα , anotata ekpaideytika idrymata , " αει " ) consists of two parallel sectors : the university sector ( universities , polytechnics , fine arts schools , the open university ) and the technological sector ( technological education institutions ( tei ) and the school of pedagogic and technological education ) . there are also state non-university tertiary institutes offering vocationally oriented courses of shorter duration ( 2 to 3 years ) which operate under the authority of other ministries . students are admitted to these institutes according to their performance at national level examinations taking place after completion of the third grade of lykeio . additionally , students over twenty-two years old may be admitted to the hellenic open university through a form of lottery . the capodistrian university of athens is the oldest university in the eastern mediterranean .
in 1974 , the unmanned astroflight sunrise plane made the first solar flight . on 29 april 1979 , the solar riser made the first flight in a solar-powered , fully controlled , man carrying flying machine , reaching an altitude of 40 feet ( 12 m ) . in 1980 , the gossamer penguin made the first piloted flights powered solely by photovoltaics . this was quickly followed by the solar challenger which crossed the english channel in july 1981 . in 1990 eric scott raymond in 21 hops flew from california to north carolina using solar power . developments then turned back to unmanned aerial vehicles ( uav ) with the pathfinder ( 1997 ) and subsequent designs , culminating in the helios which set the altitude record for a non-rocket-propelled aircraft at 29,524 metres ( 96,864 ft ) in 2001 . the zephyr , developed by bae systems , is the latest in a line of record-breaking solar aircraft , making a 54-hour flight in 2007 , and month-long flights were envisioned by 2010 . as of 2015 , solar impulse , an electric aircraft , is currently circumnavigating the globe . it is a single-seat plane powered by solar cells and capable of taking off under its own power . the designed allows the aircraft to remain airborne for 36 hours .
capacitors deviate from the ideal capacitor equation in a number of ways . some of these , such as leakage current and parasitic effects are linear , or can be assumed to be linear , and can be dealt with by adding virtual components to the equivalent circuit of the capacitor . the usual methods of network analysis can then be applied . in other cases , such as with breakdown voltage , the effect is non-linear and normal ( i.e. , linear ) network analysis cannot be used , the effect must be dealt with separately . there is yet another group , which may be linear but invalidate the assumption in the analysis that capacitance is a constant . such an example is temperature dependence . finally , combined parasitic effects such as inherent inductance , resistance , or dielectric losses can exhibit non-uniform behavior at variable frequencies of operation .
on thursday , september 19 , 1985 , at 7 : 19 am local time , mexico city was struck by an earthquake of magnitude 8.1 on the richter scale . although this earthquake was not as deadly or destructive as many similar events in asia and other parts of latin america , it proved to be a disaster politically for the one-party government . the government was paralyzed by its own bureaucracy and corruption , forcing ordinary citizens to create and direct their own rescue efforts and to reconstruct much of the housing that was lost as well .
corruption can also affect the various components of sports activities ( referees , players , medical and laboratory staff involved in anti-doping controls , members of national sport federation and international committees deciding about the allocation of contracts and competition places ) .
the first phase of neoclassicism in france is expressed in the " louis xvi style " of architects like ange-jacques gabriel ( petit trianon , 1762-68 ) ; the second phase , in the styles called directoire and " empire , " might be characterized by jean chalgrin 's severe astylar arc de triomphe ( designed in 1806 ) . in england the two phases might be characterized first by the structures of robert adam , the second by those of sir john soane . the interior style in france was initially a parisian style , the " gout grec " ( " greek style " ) not a court style . only when the young king acceded to the throne in 1771 did marie antoinette , his fashion-loving queen , bring the " louis xvi " style to court .
new york 's high rate of public transit use , over 200,000 daily cyclists as of 2014 , and many pedestrian commuters make it the most energy-efficient major city in the united states . walk and bicycle modes of travel account for 21 % of all modes for trips in the city ; nationally the rate for metro regions is about 8 % . in both its 2011 and 2015 rankings , walk score named new york city the most walkable large city in the united states . citibank sponsored the introduction of 10,000 public bicycles for the city 's bike-share project in the summer of 2013 . research conducted by quinnipiac university showed that a majority of new yorkers support the initiative . new york city 's numerical " in-season cycling indicator " of bicycling in the city hit an all-time high in 2013 .
korea was ruled by japan from 1910 until the closing days of world war ii . in august 1945 , the soviet union declared war on japan and - by agreement with the united states - occupied korea north of the 38th parallel . u.s. forces subsequently occupied the south and japan surrendered . by 1948 , two separate governments had been set up . both governments claimed to be the legitimate government of korea , and neither side accepted the border as permanent . the conflict escalated into open warfare when north korean forces - supported by the soviet union and china - invaded south korea on 25 june 1950 . on that day , the united nations security council recognized this north korean act as invasion and called for an immediate ceasefire . on 27 june , the security council adopted s / res / 83 : complaint of aggression upon the republic of korea and decided the formation and dispatch of the un forces in korea . twenty-one countries of the united nations eventually contributed to the defense of south korea , with the united states providing 88 % of the un 's military personnel .
the fourth digimon series , which began airing on april 7 , 2002 , radically departs from the previous three by focusing on a new and very different kind of evolution , spirit evolution , in which the human characters use their d-tectors ( this series ' digivice ) to transform themselves into special digimon called legendary warriors , detracting from the customary formula of having digital partners . after receiving unusual phone messages from ophanimon ( one of the three ruling digimon alongside seraphimon and cherubimon ) takuya kanbara , koji minamoto , junpei shibayama , zoe orimoto , tommy himi , and koichi kimura go to a subway station and take a train to the digital world . summoned by ophanimon , the digidestined realize that they must find the ten legendary spirits and stop the forces of cherubimon from physically destroying the digital world . after finding the ten spirits of the legendary warriors and defeating mercurymon , grumblemon , ranamon , and arbormon , they finally end up fighting cherubimon hoping to foil his effort to dominate the digital world . after the defeat of cherubimon , the digidestined find they must face an even greater challenge as they try to stop the royal knights - dynasmon and crusadermon - from destroying the digital world and using the collected data to revive the original ruler of the digital world : the tyrannical lucemon . ultimately the digidestined fail in preventing lucemon from reawakening but they do manage to prevent him from escaping into the real world . in the final battle , all of the legendary spirits the digidestined have collected thus far merge and create susanoomon . with this new form , the digidestined are able to effectively defeat lucemon and save the digital world . in general , frontier has a much lighter tone than that of tamers , yet remains darker than adventure and adventure 02 .
the ming dynasty granted titles to lamas of schools such as the karmapa kargyu , but the latter had previously declined mongol invitations to receive titles . when the ming yongle emperor invited je tsongkhapa ( 1357-1419 ) , founder of the gelug school , to come to the ming court and pay tribute , the latter declined . wang and nyima write that this was due to old age and physical weakness , and also because of efforts being made to build three major monasteries . chen qingying states that tsongkhapa wrote a letter to decline the emperor 's invitation , and in this reply , tsongkhapa wrote :
bacteria display a wide diversity of shapes and sizes , called morphologies . bacterial cells are about one-tenth the size of eukaryotic cells and are typically 0.5-5.0 micrometres in length . however , a few species are visible to the unaided eye - for example , thiomargarita namibiensis is up to half a millimetre long and epulopiscium fishelsoni reaches 0.7 mm . among the smallest bacteria are members of the genus mycoplasma , which measure only 0.3 micrometres , as small as the largest viruses . some bacteria may be even smaller , but these ultramicrobacteria are not well-studied .
with the occupation by napoleon , portugal began a slow but inexorable decline that lasted until the 20th century . this decline was hastened by the independence in 1822 of the country 's largest colonial possession , brazil . in 1807 , as napoleon 's army closed in on lisbon , the prince regent joao vi of portugal transferred his court to brazil and established rio de janeiro as the capital of the portuguese empire . in 1815 , brazil was declared a kingdom and the kingdom of portugal was united with it , forming a pluricontinental state , the united kingdom of portugal , brazil and the algarves .
after the decline of aksum , the eritrean highlands were under the domain of bahr negash ruled by the bahr negus . the area was then known as ma 'ikele bahr ( " between the seas / rivers , " i.e. the land between the red sea and the mereb river ) . it was later renamed under emperor zara yaqob as the domain of the bahr negash , the medri bahri ( " sea land " in tingrinya , although it included some areas like shire on the other side of the mereb , today in ethiopia ) . with its capital at debarwa , the state 's main provinces were hamasien , serae and akele guzai .
in the private sector , corruption increases the cost of business through the price of illicit payments themselves , the management cost of negotiating with officials and the risk of breached agreements or detection . although some claim corruption reduces costs by cutting bureaucracy , the availability of bribes can also induce officials to contrive new rules and delays . openly removing costly and lengthy regulations are better than covertly allowing them to be bypassed by using bribes . where corruption inflates the cost of business , it also distorts the playing field , shielding firms with connections from competition and thereby sustaining inefficient firms .
seattle 's population historically has been predominantly white . the 2010 census showed that seattle was one of the whitest big cities in the country , although its proportion of white residents has been gradually declining . in 1960 , whites comprised 91.6 % of the city 's population , while in 2010 they comprised 69.5 % . according to the 2006-2008 american community survey , approximately 78.9 % of residents over the age of five spoke only english at home . those who spoke asian languages other than indo-european languages made up 10.2 % of the population , spanish was spoken by 4.5 % of the population , speakers of other indo-european languages made up 3.9 % , and speakers of other languages made up 2.5 % .
in january 1987 , chicago artist steve " silk " hurley 's " jack your body " reached number one in the uk , showing it was possible for house music to cross over . the same month also saw raze enter the top 20 with " jack the groove , " and several further house hits reached the top ten that year . stock aitken waterman 's productions for mel and kim , including the number-one hit " respectable , " added elements of house to their previous europop sound , and session group mirage scored top-ten hits with " jack mix ii " and " jack mix iv , " medleys of previous electro and europop hits rearranged in a house style . key labels in the rise of house music in the uk included :
romila thapar notes that the division into hindu-muslim-british periods of indian history gives too much weight to " ruling dynasties and foreign invasions , " neglecting the social-economic history which often showed a strong continuity . the division into ancient-medieval-modern periods overlooks the fact that the muslim conquests occurred gradually during which time many things came and went off , while the south was never completely conquered . according to thapar , a periodisation could also be based on " significant social and economic changes , " which are not strictly related to a change of ruling powers . [ note 1 ]
television money had also become much more important ; the football league received £ 6.3 million for a two-year agreement in 1986 , but when that deal was renewed in 1988 , the price rose to £ 44 million over four years . the 1988 negotiations were the first signs of a breakaway league ; ten clubs threatened to leave and form a " super league , " but were eventually persuaded to stay . as stadiums improved and match attendance and revenues rose , the country 's top teams again considered leaving the football league in order to capitalise on the growing influx of money being pumped into the sport .
the marshall islands , officially the republic of the marshall islands ( marshallese : aolepan aorokin m  ajel ) , [ note 1 ] is an island country located near the equator in the pacific ocean , slightly west of the international date line . geographically , the country is part of the larger island group of micronesia . the country 's population of 53,158 people ( at the 2011 census ) is spread out over 29 coral atolls , comprising 1,156 individual islands and islets . the islands share maritime boundaries with the federated states of micronesia to the west , wake island to the north , [ note 2 ] kiribati to the south-east , and nauru to the south . about 27,797 of the islanders ( at the 2011 census ) live on majuro , which contains the capital .
the last major building work took place during the reign of king george v when , in 1913 , sir aston webb redesigned blore 's 1850 east front to resemble in part giacomo leoni 's lyme park in cheshire . this new , refaced principal facade ( of portland stone ) was designed to be the backdrop to the victoria memorial , a large memorial statue of queen victoria , placed outside the main gates . george v , who had succeeded edward vii in 1910 , had a more serious personality than his father ; greater emphasis was now placed on official entertaining and royal duties than on lavish parties . he arranged a series of command performances featuring jazz musicians such as the original dixieland jazz band ( 1919 ) - the first jazz performance for a head of state , sidney bechet , and louis armstrong ( 1932 ) , which earned the palace a nomination in 2009 for a ( kind of ) blue plaque by the brecon jazz festival as one of the venues making the greatest contribution to jazz music in the united kingdom . george v 's wife queen mary was a connoisseur of the arts , and took a keen interest in the royal collection of furniture and art , both restoring and adding to it . queen mary also had many new fixtures and fittings installed , such as the pair of marble empire-style chimneypieces by benjamin vulliamy , dating from 1810 , which the queen had installed in the ground floor bow room , the huge low room at the centre of the garden facade . queen mary was also responsible for the decoration of the blue drawing room . this room , 69 feet ( 21 metres ) long , previously known as the south drawing room , has a ceiling designed specially by nash , coffered with huge gilt console brackets .
the wet season begins some time in may , ending in mid-october . during this period , temperatures are in the mid 80s to low 90s ( 29-35 ° c ) , accompanied by high humidity , though the heat is often relieved by afternoon thunderstorms or a sea breeze that develops off the atlantic ocean , which then allow lower temperatures , but conditions still remain very muggy . much of the year 's 55.9 inches ( 1,420 mm ) of rainfall occurs during this period . dewpoints in the warm months range from 71.9 ° f ( 22.2 ° c ) in june to 73.7 ° f ( 23.2 ° c ) in august .
president benito juarez was re-elected in the general election of 1867 in which he received strong liberal support , especially in chihuahua . luis terrazas was confirmed by the people of chihuahua to be governor of the state . but soon after the election , president juarez had another crisis on his hands ; the juarez administration was suspected to be involved in the assassination of the military chief jose maria patoni executed by general canto in august 1868 . general canto turned himself over to donato guerra . canto was sentenced to death , but later his sentence changed to 10 years imprisonment . the sense of injustice gave rise to a new rebellion in 1869 that threatened the federal government . in response , the juarez administration took drastic measures by temporarily suspending constitutional rights , but the governor of chihuahua did not support this action . hostilities continued to increase especially after the election of 1871 which was perceived to be fraudulent . a new popular leader arose among the rebels , porfirio diaz . the federal government was successful in quelling rebellions in durango an chihuahua . on july 18 , 1872 , president juarez died from a heart attack ; soon after , many of his supporters ceased the fighting . peace returned to chihuahua and the new government was led by governor antonio ochoa ( formerly a co-owner of the batopilas silver mines ) in 1873 after luis terrazas finished his term in 1872 .

the protestant concept of god and man allows believers to use all their god-given faculties , including the power of reason . that means that they are allowed to explore god 's creation and , according to genesis 2 : 15 , make use of it in a responsible and sustainable way . thus a cultural climate was created that greatly enhanced the development of the humanities and the sciences . another consequence of the protestant understanding of man is that the believers , in gratitude for their election and redemption in christ , are to follow god 's commandments . industry , frugality , calling , discipline , and a strong sense of responsibility are at the heart of their moral code . in particular , calvin rejected luxury . therefore , craftsmen , industrialists , and other businessmen were able to reinvest the greater part of their profits in the most efficient machinery and the most modern production methods that were based on progress in the sciences and technology . as a result , productivity grew , which led to increased profits and enabled employers to pay higher wages . in this way , the economy , the sciences , and technology reinforced each other . the chance to participate in the economic success of technological inventions was a strong incentive to both inventors and investors . the protestant work ethic was an important force behind the unplanned and uncoordinated mass action that influenced the development of capitalism and the industrial revolution . this idea is also known as the " protestant ethic thesis . "
the geologic record of the proterozoic ( 2,500 to 541 million years ago ) is more complete than that for the preceding archean . in contrast to the deep-water deposits of the archean , the proterozoic features many strata that were laid down in extensive shallow epicontinental seas ; furthermore , many of these rocks are less metamorphosed than archean-age ones , and plenty are unaltered . study of these rocks show that the eon featured massive , rapid continental accretion ( unique to the proterozoic ) , supercontinent cycles , and wholly modern orogenic activity . roughly 750 million years ago , the earliest-known supercontinent rodinia , began to break apart . the continents later recombined to form pannotia , 600-540 ma .
antarctica ( us english i / æntˈɑːrktɪkə / , uk english / ænˈtɑːktɪkə / or / ænˈtɑːtɪkə / or / ænˈɑːtɪkə / ) [ note 1 ] is earth 's southernmost continent , containing the geographic south pole . it is situated in the antarctic region of the southern hemisphere , almost entirely south of the antarctic circle , and is surrounded by the southern ocean . at 14,000,000 square kilometres ( 5,400,000 square miles ) , it is the fifth-largest continent in area after asia , africa , north america , and south america . for comparison , antarctica is nearly twice the size of australia . about 98 % of antarctica is covered by ice that averages 1.9 km ( 1.2 mi ; 6,200 ft ) in thickness , which extends to all but the northernmost reaches of the antarctic peninsula .
insects were the earliest organisms to produce and sense sounds . insects make sounds mostly by mechanical action of appendages . in grasshoppers and crickets , this is achieved by stridulation . cicadas make the loudest sounds among the insects by producing and amplifying sounds with special modifications to their body and musculature . the african cicada brevisana brevis has been measured at 106.7 decibels at a distance of 50 cm ( 20 in ) . some insects , such as the helicoverpa zeamoths , hawk moths and hedylid butterflies , can hear ultrasound and take evasive action when they sense that they have been detected by bats . some moths produce ultrasonic clicks that were once thought to have a role in jamming bat echolocation . the ultrasonic clicks were subsequently found to be produced mostly by unpalatable moths to warn bats , just as warning colorations are used against predators that hunt by sight . some otherwise palatable moths have evolved to mimic these calls . more recently , the claim that some moths can jam bat sonar has been revisited . ultrasonic recording and high-speed infrared videography of bat-moth interactions suggest the palatable tiger moth really does defend against attacking big brown bats using ultrasonic clicks that jam bat sonar .
in 1845 , ireland was hit by a potato blight . in the next four years over a million irish people died and another million emigrated in what became known as the great famine . in ireland , victoria was labelled " the famine queen . " she personally donated £ 2,000 to famine relief , more than any other individual donor , and also supported the maynooth grant to a roman catholic seminary in ireland , despite protestant opposition . the story that she donated only £ 5 in aid to the irish , and on the same day gave the same amount to battersea dogs home , was a myth generated towards the end of the 19th century .
the great exhibition was organised by prince albert , henry cole , francis fuller and other members of the royal society for the encouragement of arts , manufactures and commerce . the great exhibition made a surplus of £ 186,000 used in creating an area in the south of kensington celebrating the encouragement of the arts , industry , and science . albert insisted the great exhibition surplus should be used as a home for culture and education for everyone . his commitment was to find practical solutions to today 's social challenges . prince albert 's vision built the victoria and albert museum , science museum , natural history museum , geological museum , royal college of science , royal college of art , royal school of mines , royal school of music , royal college of organists , royal school of needlework , royal geographical society , institute of recorded sound , royal horticultural gardens , royal albert hall and the imperial institute . royal colleges and the imperial institute merged to form what is now imperial college london .
although they did not fix their schedules to the clock in the modern sense , ancient civilizations adjusted daily schedules to the sun more flexibly than modern dst does , often dividing daylight into twelve hours regardless of day length , so that each daylight hour was longer during summer . for example , roman water clocks had different scales for different months of the year : at rome 's latitude the third hour from sunrise , hora tertia , started by modern standards at 09 : 02 solar time and lasted 44 minutes at the winter solstice , but at the summer solstice it started at 06 : 58 and lasted 75 minutes . after ancient times , equal-length civil hours eventually supplanted unequal , so civil time no longer varies by season . unequal hours are still used in a few traditional settings , such as some mount athos monasteries and all jewish ceremonies .
thomas j. watson , sr. , fired from the national cash register company by john henry patterson , called on flint and , in 1914 , was offered ctr . watson joined ctr as general manager then , 11 months later , was made president when court cases relating to his time at ncr were resolved . having learned patterson 's pioneering business practices , watson proceeded to put the stamp of ncr onto ctr 's companies . he implemented sales conventions , " generous sales incentives , a focus on customer service , an insistence on well-groomed , dark-suited salesmen and had an evangelical fervor for instilling company pride and loyalty in every worker . " his favorite slogan , " think , " became a mantra for each company 's employees . during watson 's first four years , revenues more than doubled to $ 9 million and the company 's operations expanded to europe , south america , asia and australia . " watson had never liked the clumsy hyphenated title of the ctr " and chose to replace it with the more expansive title " international business machines . " first as a name for a 1917 canadian subsidiary , then as a line in advertisements . for example , the mcclures magazine , v53 , may 1921 , has a full page ad with , at the bottom :
modern archaeology has led to the discovery of han artwork portraying inventions which were otherwise absent in han literary sources . as observed in han miniature tomb models , but not in literary sources , the crank handle was used to operate the fans of winnowing machines that separated grain from chaff . the odometer cart , invented during han , measured journey lengths , using mechanical figures banging drums and gongs to indicate each distance traveled . this invention is depicted in han artwork by the 2nd century ad , yet detailed written descriptions were not offered until the 3rd century ad . modern archaeologists have also unearthed specimens of devices used during the han dynasty , for example a pair of sliding metal calipers used by craftsmen for making minute measurements . these calipers contain inscriptions of the exact day and year they were manufactured . these tools are not mentioned in any han literary sources .
flora gomes is an internationally renowned film director ; his most famous film is nha fala ( english : my voice ) . gomes 's mortu nega ( death denied ) ( 1988 ) was the first fiction film and the second feature film ever made in guinea-bissau .

henry ii wanted to secure the southern borders of aquitaine and decided to betroth his youngest son to alais , the daughter and heiress of humbert iii of savoy . as part of this agreement john was promised the future inheritance of savoy , piedmont , maurienne , and the other possessions of count humbert . for his part in the potential marriage alliance , henry ii transferred the castles of chinon , loudun and mirebeau into john 's name ; as john was only five years old his father would continue to control them for practical purposes . henry the young king was unimpressed by this ; although he had yet to be granted control of any castles in his new kingdom , these were effectively his future property and had been given away without consultation . alais made the trip over the alps and joined henry ii 's court , but she died before marrying john , which left the prince once again without an inheritance .
tuvalu participates in the operations of the pacific island forum fisheries agency ( ffa ) and the western and central pacific fisheries commission ( wcpfc ) . the tuvaluan government , the us government , and the governments of other pacific islands , are parties to the south pacific tuna treaty ( sptt ) , which entered into force in 1988 . tuvalu is also a member of the nauru agreement which addresses the management of tuna purse seine fishing in the tropical western pacific . in may 2013 representatives from the united states and the pacific islands countries agreed to sign interim arrangement documents to extend the multilateral fisheries treaty ( which encompasses the south pacific tuna treaty ) to confirm access to the fisheries in the western and central pacific for us tuna boats for 18 months . tuvalu and the other members of the pacific island forum fisheries agency ( ffa ) and the united states have settled a tuna fishing deal for 2015 ; a longer term deal will be negotiated . the treaty is an extension of the nauru agreement and provides for us flagged purse seine vessels to fish 8,300 days in the region in return for a payment of us $ 90 million made up by tuna fishing industry and us-government contributions . in 2015 tuvalu has refused to sell fishing days to certain nations and fleets that have blocked tuvaluan initiatives to develop and sustain their own fishery .
the final stage of database design is to make the decisions that affect performance , scalability , recovery , security , and the like . this is often called physical database design . a key goal during this stage is data independence , meaning that the decisions made for performance optimization purposes should be invisible to end-users and applications . physical design is driven mainly by performance requirements , and requires a good knowledge of the expected workload and access patterns , and a deep understanding of the features offered by the chosen dbms .
the top 12 finalists originally included mario vazquez , but he dropped out citing ' personal reasons ' and was replaced by nikko smith . later , an employee of freemantle media , which produces the show , sued the company for wrongful termination , claiming that he was dismissed after complaining about lewd behavior by vazquez toward him during the show .
the textile-making communities in somalia are a continuation of an ancient textile industry , as is the culture of wood carving , pottery and monumental architecture that dominates somali interiors and landscapes . the cultural diffusion of somali commercial enterprise can be detected in its cuisine , which contains southeast asian influences . due to the somali people 's passionate love for and facility with poetry , somalia has often been referred to by scholars as a " nation of poets " and a " nation of bards " including , among others , the canadian novelist margaret laurence .
the wildcard round returned in season eight , wherein there were three groups of twelve , with three contestants moving forward - the highest male , the highest female , and the next highest-placed singer - for each night , and four wildcards were chosen by the judges to produce a final 13 . starting season ten , the girls and boys perform on separate nights . in seasons ten and eleven , five of each gender were chosen , and three wildcards were chosen by the judges to form a final 13 . in season twelve , the top twenty semifinalists were split into gender groups , with five of each gender advancing to form the final 10 . in season thirteen , there were thirty semifinalists , but only twenty semifinalists ( ten for each gender ) were chosen by the judges to perform on the live shows , with five in each gender and three wildcards chosen by the judges composing the final 13 .
in modern color theory , also known as the rgb color model , red , green and blue are additive primary colors . red , green and blue light combined together makes white light , and these three colors , combined in different mixtures , can produce nearly any other color . this is the principle that is used to make all of the colors on your computer screen and your television . for example , purple on a computer screen is made by a similar formula to used by cennino cennini in the renaissance to make violet , but using additive colors and light instead of pigment : it is created by combining red and blue light at equal intensity on a black screen . violet is made on a computer screen in a similar way , but with a greater amount of blue light and less red light .
the standing wave forms with this desired pattern at the design frequency , f0 , and antennas are normally designed to be this size . however , feeding that element with 3f0 ( whose wavelength is 1 ⁄ 3 that of f0 ) will also lead to a standing wave pattern . thus , an antenna element is also resonant when its length is 3 ⁄ 4 of a wavelength . this is true for all odd multiples of 1 ⁄ 4 wavelength . this allows some flexibility of design in terms of antenna lengths and feed points . antennas used in such a fashion are known to be harmonically operated .
on 4 january 2016 , barcelona 's transfer ban ended . the same day , they registered 77 players across all categories and ages , and both last summer signings arda turan and aleix vidal became eligible to play with the first team . on 10 february , qualifying for the sixth copa del rey final in the last eight seasons , luis enrique 's barcelona broke the club 's record of 28 consecutive games unbeaten in all competitions set by guardiola 's team in the 2010-11 season , with a 1-1 draw with valencia in the second leg of the 2015-16 copa del rey .
genocide has become an official term used in international relations . the word genocide was not in use before 1944 . before this , in 1941 , winston churchill described the mass killing of russian prisoners of war and civilians as " a crime without a name . " in that year , a polish-jewish lawyer named raphael lemkin , described the policies of systematic murder founded by the nazis as genocide . the word genocide is the combination of the greek prefix geno- ( meaning tribe or race ) and caedere ( the latin word for to kill ) . the word is defined as a specific set of violent crimes that are committed against a certain group with the attempt to remove the entire group from existence or to destroy them .
kathmandu has a larger proportion of tea drinkers than coffee drinkers . tea is widely served but is extremely weak by western standards . it is richer and contains tea leaves boiled with milk , sugar and spices . alcohol is widely drunk , and there are numerous local variants of alcoholic beverages . drinking and driving is illegal , and authorities have a zero tolerance policy . ailaa and thwon ( alcohol made from rice ) are the alcoholic beverages of kathmandu , found in all the local bhattis ( alcohol serving eateries ) . chhyaang , tongba ( fermented millet or barley ) and rakshi are alcoholic beverages from other parts of nepal which are found in kathmandu . however , shops and bars in kathmandu widely sell western and nepali beers .
ter-petrosyan led armenia alongside defense minister vazgen sargsyan through the nagorno-karabakh war with neighboring azerbaijan . the initial post-soviet years were marred by economic difficulties , which had their roots early in the karabakh conflict when the azerbaijani popular front managed to pressure the azerbaijan ssr to instigate a railway and air blockade against armenia . this move effectively crippled armenia 's economy as 85 % of its cargo and goods arrived through rail traffic . in 1993 , turkey joined the blockade against armenia in support of azerbaijan .
in february 2012 , capello resigned from his role as england manager , following a disagreement with the fa over their request to remove john terry from team captaincy after accusations of racial abuse concerning the player . following this , there was media speculation that harry redknapp would take the job . however , on 1 may 2012 , roy hodgson was announced as the new manager , just six weeks before uefa euro 2012 . england managed to finish top of their group , winning two and drawing one of their fixtures , but exited the championships in the quarter-finals via a penalty shoot-out , this time to italy .
research seems to favor the hypothesis that adolescents and adults think about risk in similar ways , but hold different values and thus come to different conclusions . some have argued that there may be evolutionary benefits to an increased propensity for risk-taking in adolescence . for example , without a willingness to take risks , teenagers would not have the motivation or confidence necessary to leave their family of origin . in addition , from a population perspective , there is an advantage to having a group of individuals willing to take more risks and try new methods , counterbalancing the more conservative elements more typical of the received knowledge held by older adults . risktaking may also have reproductive advantages : adolescents have a newfound priority in sexual attraction and dating , and risk-taking is required to impress potential mates . research also indicates that baseline sensation seeking may affect risk-taking behavior throughout the lifespan .
in 1966 the blind beggar in whitechapel became infamous as the scene of a murder committed by gangster ronnie kray . the ten bells is associated with several of the victims of jack the ripper . in 1955 , ruth ellis , the last woman executed in the united kingdom , shot david blakely as he emerged from the magdala in south hill park , hampstead , the bullet holes can still be seen in the walls outside . it is said that vladimir lenin and a young joseph stalin met in the crown and anchor pub ( now known as the crown tavern ) on clerkenwell green when the latter was visiting london in 1903 .
on october 25 , 1836 , construction began on the wilmington and raleigh railroad to connect the port city of wilmington with the state capital of raleigh . in 1849 the north carolina railroad was created by act of the legislature to extend that railroad west to greensboro , high point , and charlotte . during the civil war , the wilmington-to-raleigh stretch of the railroad would be vital to the confederate war effort ; supplies shipped into wilmington would be moved by rail through raleigh to the confederate capital of richmond , virginia .

the site where the saint petersburg passage sprawls had been devoted to trade since the city 's foundation in the early 18th century . it had been occupied by various shops and warehouses ( maly gostiny dvor , schukin dvor , apraksin dvor ) until 1846 , when count essen-stenbock-fermor acquired the grounds to build an elite shopping mall for the russian nobility and wealthy bourgeoisie . stenbock-fermor conceived of the passage as more than a mere shopping mall , but also as a cultural and social centre for the people of st petersburg . the edifice contained coffee-houses , confectioneries , panorama installations , an anatomical museum , a wax museum , and even a small zoo , described by dostoyevsky in his extravaganza " crocodile , or passage through the passage . " the concert hall became renowned as a setting for literary readings attended by the likes of dostoevsky and turgenev . parenthetically , the passage premises have long been associated with the entertainment industry and still remains home to the komissarzhevskaya theatre .
prince hall freemasonry exists because of the refusal of early american lodges to admit african-americans . in 1775 , an african-american named prince hall , along with fourteen other african-americans , was initiated into a british military lodge with a warrant from the grand lodge of ireland , having failed to obtain admission from the other lodges in boston . when the military lodge left north america , those fifteen men were given the authority to meet as a lodge , but not to initiate masons . in 1784 , these individuals obtained a warrant from the premier grand lodge of england ( gle ) and formed african lodge , number 459 . when the ugle was formed in 1813 , all u.s.-based lodges were stricken from their rolls - due largely to the war of 1812 . thus , separated from both ugle and any concordantly recognised u.s. grand lodge , african lodge re-titled itself as the african lodge , number 1 - and became a de facto " grand lodge " ( this lodge is not to be confused with the various grand lodges on the continent of africa ) . as with the rest of u.s. freemasonry , prince hall freemasonry soon grew and organised on a grand lodge system for each state .
memories and lessons from the war are still a major factor in american politics . one side views the war as a necessary part of the containment policy , which allowed the enemy to choose the time and place of warfare . others note the u.s. made major strategic gains as the communists were defeated in indonesia , and by 1972 both moscow and beijing were competing for american support , at the expense of their allies in hanoi . critics see the conflict as a " quagmire " - an endless waste of american blood and treasure in a conflict that did not concern us interests . fears of another quagmire have been major factors in foreign policy debates ever since . the draft became extremely unpopular , and president nixon ended it in 1973 , forcing the military ( the army especially ) to rely entirely upon volunteers . that raised the issue of how well the professional military reflected overall american society and values ; the soldiers typically took the position that their service represented the highest and best american values .
reporters without borders organised several symbolic protests , including scaling the eiffel tower to hang a protest banner from it , and hanging an identical banner from the notre dame cathedral .
on 1 march 1951 mao sent a cable to stalin , in which he emphasized the difficulties faced by chinese forces and the urgent need for air cover , especially over supply lines . apparently impressed by the chinese war effort , stalin finally agreed to supply two air force divisions , three anti-aircraft divisions , and six thousand trucks . pva troops in korea continued to suffer severe logistical problems throughout the war . in late april peng dehuai sent his deputy , hong xuezhi , to brief zhou enlai in beijing . what chinese soldiers feared , hong said , was not the enemy , but that they had nothing to eat , no bullets to shoot , and no trucks to transport them to the rear when they were wounded . zhou attempted to respond to the pva 's logistical concerns by increasing chinese production and improving methods of supply , but these efforts were never completely sufficient . at the same time , large-scale air defense training programs were carried out , and the chinese air force began to participate in the war from september 1951 onward .
antibacterial-resistant strains and species , sometimes referred to as " superbugs , " now contribute to the emergence of diseases that were for a while well controlled . for example , emergent bacterial strains causing tuberculosis ( tb ) that are resistant to previously effective antibacterial treatments pose many therapeutic challenges . every year , nearly half a million new cases of multidrug-resistant tuberculosis ( mdr-tb ) are estimated to occur worldwide . for example , ndm-1 is a newly identified enzyme conveying bacterial resistance to a broad range of beta-lactam antibacterials . the united kingdom 's health protection agency has stated that " most isolates with ndm-1 enzyme are resistant to all standard intravenous antibiotics for treatment of severe infections . "
genetic engineering is the modification of an organism 's genome through biotechnology . since the 1970s , a variety of techniques have been developed to specifically add , remove and edit genes in an organism . recently developed genome engineering techniques use engineered nuclease enzymes to create targeted dna repair in a chromosome to either disrupt or edit a gene when the break is repaired . the related term synthetic biology is sometimes used to refer to extensive genetic engineering of an organism .
in time , some ideas from these experiments and paradigm challenges may be adopted as the norm in education , just as friedrich frobel 's approach to early childhood education in 19th-century germany has been incorporated into contemporary kindergarten classrooms . other influential writers and thinkers have included the swiss humanitarian johann heinrich pestalozzi ; the american transcendentalists amos bronson alcott , ralph waldo emerson , and henry david thoreau ; the founders of progressive education , john dewey and francis parker ; and educational pioneers such as maria montessori and rudolf steiner , and more recently john caldwell holt , paul goodman , frederick mayer , george dennison and ivan illich .
digestive systems take many forms . there is a fundamental distinction between internal and external digestion . external digestion developed earlier in evolutionary history , and most fungi still rely on it . in this process , enzymes are secreted into the environment surrounding the organism , where they break down an organic material , and some of the products diffuse back to the organism . animals have a tube ( gastrointestinal tract ) in which internal digestion occurs , which is more efficient because more of the broken down products can be captured , and the internal chemical environment can be more efficiently controlled .
the legislative assembly of the federal district is formed , as it is the case in all legislatures in mexico , by both single-seat and proportional seats , making it a system of parallel voting . the federal district is divided into 40 electoral constituencies of similar population which elect one representative by first-past-the-post plurality ( fpp ) , locally called " uninominal deputies . " the federal district as a whole constitutes a single constituency for the parallel election of 26 representatives by proportionality ( pr ) with open-party lists , locally called " plurinominal deputies . "
on november 6 , 2013 , google implemented a new comment system that requires all youtube users to use a google + account in order to comment on videos and making the comment system google + oriented . the changes are in large part an attempt to address the frequent criticisms of the quality and tone of youtube comments . they give creators more power to moderate and block comments , and add new sorting mechanisms to ensure that better , more relevant discussions appear at the top . the new system restored the ability to include urls in comments , which had previously been removed due to problems with abuse . in response , youtube co-founder jawed karim posted the question " why the fuck do i need a google + account to comment on a video ? " on his youtube channel to express his negative opinion of the change . the official youtube announcement received 20,097 " thumbs down " votes and generated more than 32,000 comments in two days . writing in the newsday blog silicon island , chase melvin noted that " google + is nowhere near as popular a social media network as facebook , but it 's essentially being forced upon millions of youtube users who don 't want to lose their ability to comment on videos " and " discussion forums across the internet are already bursting with outcry against the new comment system . " in the same article melvin goes on to say :
the same divine agencies who caused disease or harm also had the power to avert it , and so might be placated in advance . divine consideration might be sought to avoid the inconvenient delays of a journey , or encounters with banditry , piracy and shipwreck , with due gratitude to be rendered on safe arrival or return . in times of great crisis , the senate could decree collective public rites , in which rome 's citizens , including women and children , moved in procession from one temple to the next , supplicating the gods .
there has also been an increase of yuppie , bohemian , and hipster types particularly around center city , the neighborhood of northern liberties , and in the neighborhoods around the city 's universities , such as near temple in north philadelphia and particularly near drexel and university of pennsylvania in west philadelphia . philadelphia is also home to a significant gay and lesbian population . philadelphia 's gayborhood , which is located near washington square , is home to a large concentration of gay and lesbian friendly businesses , restaurants , and bars .
phillip bard contributed to the theory with his work on animals . bard found that sensory , motor , and physiological information all had to pass through the diencephalon ( particularly the thalamus ) , before being subjected to any further processing . therefore , cannon also argued that it was not anatomically possible for sensory events to trigger a physiological response prior to triggering conscious awareness and emotional stimuli had to trigger both physiological and experiential aspects of emotion simultaneously .
while the concordat restored much power to the papacy , the balance of church-state relations had tilted firmly in napoleon 's favour . he selected the bishops and supervised church finances . napoleon and the pope both found the concordat useful . similar arrangements were made with the church in territories controlled by napoleon , especially italy and germany . now , napoleon could win favor with the catholics while also controlling rome in a political sense . napoleon said in april 1801 , " skillful conquerors have not got entangled with priests . they can both contain them and use them . " french children were issued a catechism that taught them to love and respect napoleon .
john keate , head master from 1809 to 1834 , took over at a time when discipline was poor . anthony chenevix-trench , head master from 1964 to 1970 , abolished the birch and replaced it with caning , also applied to the bare posterior , which he administered privately in his office . chenevix-trench also abolished corporal punishment administered by senior boys . previously , house captains were permitted to cane miscreants over the seat of the trousers . this was a routine occurrence , carried out privately with the boy bending over with his head under the edge of a table . less common but more severe were the canings administered by pop ( see eton society below ) in the form of a " pop-tanning , " in which a large number of hard strokes were inflicted by the president of pop in the presence of all pop members ( or , in earlier times , each member of pop took it in turns to inflict a stroke ) . the culprit was summoned to appear in a pair of old trousers , as the caning would cut the cloth to shreds . this was the most severe form of physical punishment at eton .
as mentioned , lifestyle- and obesity-related diseases are becoming increasingly prevalent all around the world . there is little doubt that the increasingly widespread application of some modern food processing technologies has contributed to this development . the food processing industry is a major part of modern economy , and as such it is influential in political decisions ( e.g. , nutritional recommendations , agricultural subsidising ) . in any known profit-driven economy , health considerations are hardly a priority ; effective production of cheap foods with a long shelf-life is more the trend . in general , whole , fresh foods have a relatively short shelf-life and are less profitable to produce and sell than are more processed foods . thus , the consumer is left with the choice between more expensive , but nutritionally superior , whole , fresh foods , and cheap , usually nutritionally inferior , processed foods . because processed foods are often cheaper , more convenient ( in both purchasing , storage , and preparation ) , and more available , the consumption of nutritionally inferior foods has been increasing throughout the world along with many nutrition-related health complications .
gaddafi briefly studied history at the university of libya in benghazi , before dropping out to join the military . despite his police record , in 1963 he began training at the royal military academy , benghazi , alongside several like-minded friends from misrata . the armed forces offered the only opportunity for upward social mobility for underprivileged libyans , and gaddafi recognised it as a potential instrument of political change . under idris , libya 's armed forces were trained by the british military ; this angered gaddafi , who viewed the british as imperialists , and accordingly he refused to learn english and was rude to the british officers , ultimately failing his exams . british trainers reported him for insubordination and abusive behaviour , stating their suspicion that he was involved in the assassination of the military academy 's commander in 1963 . such reports were ignored and gaddafi quickly progressed through the course .
it has been possible to teach a migration route to a flock of birds , for example in re-introduction schemes . after a trial with canada geese branta canadensis , microlight aircraft were used in the us to teach safe migration routes to reintroduced whooping cranes grus americana .
han chinese farmers were resettled from north china by the qing to the area along the liao river in order to restore the land to cultivation . wasteland was reclaimed by han chinese squatters in addition to other han who rented land from manchu landlords . despite officially prohibiting han chinese settlement on the manchu and mongol lands , by the 18th century the qing decided to settle han refugees from northern china who were suffering from famine , floods , and drought into manchuria and inner mongolia so that han chinese farmed 500,000 hectares in manchuria and tens of thousands of hectares in inner mongolia by the 1780s . qianlong allowed han chinese peasants suffering from drought to move into manchuria despite him issuing edicts in favor of banning them from 1740-1776 . chinese tenant farmers rented or even claimed title to land from the " imperial estates " and manchu bannerlands in the area . besides moving into the liao area in southern manchuria , the path linking jinzhou , fengtian , tieling , changchun , hulun , and ningguta was settled by han chinese during the qianlong emperor 's rule , and han chinese were the majority in urban areas of manchuria by 1800 . to increase the imperial treasury 's revenue , the qing sold formerly manchu only lands along the sungari to han chinese at the beginning of the daoguang emperor 's reign , and han chinese filled up most of manchuria 's towns by the 1840s according to abbe huc .
advances in understanding genes and inheritance continued throughout the 20th century . deoxyribonucleic acid ( dna ) was shown to be the molecular repository of genetic information by experiments in the 1940s to 1950s . the structure of dna was studied by rosalind franklin using x-ray crystallography , which led james d. watson and francis crick to publish a model of the double-stranded dna molecule whose paired nucleotide bases indicated a compelling hypothesis for the mechanism of genetic replication . collectively , this body of research established the central dogma of molecular biology , which states that proteins are translated from rna , which is transcribed from dna . this dogma has since been shown to have exceptions , such as reverse transcription in retroviruses . the modern study of genetics at the level of dna is known as molecular genetics .
adaptation of the endosymbiont to the host 's lifestyle leads to many changes in the endosymbiont-the foremost being drastic reduction in its genome size . this is due to many genes being lost during the process of metabolism , and dna repair and recombination . while important genes participating in the dna to rna transcription , protein translation and dna / rna replication are retained . that is , a decrease in genome size is due to loss of protein coding genes and not due to lessening of inter-genic regions or open reading frame ( orf ) size . thus , species that are naturally evolving and contain reduced sizes of genes can be accounted for an increased number of noticeable differences between them , thereby leading to changes in their evolutionary rates . as the endosymbiotic bacteria related with these insects are passed on to the offspring strictly via vertical genetic transmission , intracellular bacteria goes through many hurdles during the process , resulting in the decrease in effective population sizes when compared to the free living bacteria . this incapability of the endosymbiotic bacteria to reinstate its wild type phenotype via a recombination process is called as muller 's ratchet phenomenon . muller 's ratchet phenomenon together with less effective population sizes has led to an accretion of deleterious mutations in the non-essential genes of the intracellular bacteria . this could have been due to lack of selection mechanisms prevailing in the rich environment of the host .
paul vi opened the third period on 14 september 1964 , telling the council fathers that he viewed the text about the church as the most important document to come out from the council . as the council discussed the role of bishops in the papacy , paul vi issued an explanatory note confirming the primacy of the papacy , a step which was viewed by some as meddling in the affairs of the council american bishops pushed for a speedy resolution on religious freedom , but paul vi insisted this to be approved together with related texts such as ecumenism . the pope concluded the session on 21 november 1964 , with the formal pronouncement of mary as mother of the church .
the term " house music " is said to have originated from a chicago club called the warehouse , which existed from 1977 to 1983 . clubbers to the warehouse were primarily black and gay , who came to dance to music played by the club 's resident dj frankie knuckles , whom fans refer to as the " godfather of house . " after the warehouse closed in 1983 , the crowds went to knuckles ' new club , the power plant . in the channel 4 documentary pump up the volume , knuckles remarks that the first time he heard the term " house music " was upon seeing " we play house music " on a sign in the window of a bar on chicago 's south side . one of the people in the car with him joked , " you know , that 's the kind of music you play down at the warehouse ! , " and then everybody laughed . south-side chicago dj leonard " remix " roy , in self-published statements , claims he put such a sign in a tavern window because it was where he played music that one might find in one 's home ; in his case , it referred to his mother 's soul & disco records , which he worked into his sets . farley jackmaster funk was quoted as saying " in 1982 , i was djing at a club called the playground and there was this kid named leonard ' remix ' roy who was a dj at a rival club called the rink . he came over to my club one night , and into the dj booth and said to me , ' i 've got the gimmick that 's gonna take all the people out of your club and into mine - it 's called house music . ' now , where he got that name from or what made him think of it i don 't know , so the answer lies with him . "
most mature clitellates ( the group that includes earthworms and leeches ) are full hermaphrodites , although in a few leech species younger adults function as males and become female at maturity . all have well-developed gonads , and all copulate . earthworms store their partners ' sperm in spermathecae ( " sperm stores " ) and then the clitellum produces a cocoon that collects ova from the ovaries and then sperm from the spermathecae . fertilization and development of earthworm eggs takes place in the cocoon . leeches ' eggs are fertilized in the ovaries , and then transferred to the cocoon . in all clitellates the cocoon also either produces yolk when the eggs are fertilized or nutrients while they are developing . all clitellates hatch as miniature adults rather than larvae .
with the decline of herodians , judea , transformed into a roman province , became the site of a violent struggle of jews against greco-romans , culminating in the jewish-roman wars , ending in wide-scale destruction , expulsions , and genocide . jewish presence in the region significantly dwindled after the failure of the bar kokhba revolt against the roman empire in 132 ce . nevertheless , there was a continuous small jewish presence and galilee became its religious center . the mishnah and part of the talmud , central jewish texts , were composed during the 2nd to 4th centuries ce in tiberias and jerusalem . the region came to be populated predominantly by greco-romans on the coast and samaritans in the hill-country . christianity was gradually evolving over roman paganism , when the area stood under byzantine rule . through the 5th and 6th centuries , the dramatic events of the repeated samaritan revolts reshaped the land , with massive destruction to byzantine christian and samaritan societies and a resulting decrease of the population . after the persian conquest and the installation of a short-lived jewish commonwealth in 614 ce , the byzantine empire reconquered the country in 628 .
the chapter house has an original mid-13th-century tiled pavement . a door within the vestibule dates from around 1050 and is believed to be the oldest in england . [ citation needed ] the exterior includes flying buttresses added in the 14th century and a leaded tent-lantern roof on an iron frame designed by scott . the chapter house was originally used in the 13th century by benedictine monks for daily meetings . it later became a meeting place of the king 's great council and the commons , predecessors of parliament .
the sumerians developed a complex system of metrology c . 4000 bc . this advanced metrology resulted in the creation of arithmetic , geometry , and algebra . from c . 2600 bc onwards , the sumerians wrote multiplication tables on clay tablets and dealt with geometrical exercises and division problems . the earliest traces of the babylonian numerals also date back to this period . the period c . 2700 - 2300 bc saw the first appearance of the abacus , and a table of successive columns which delimited the successive orders of magnitude of their sexagesimal number system . the sumerians were the first to use a place value numeral system . there is also anecdotal evidence the sumerians may have used a type of slide rule in astronomical calculations . they were the first to find the area of a triangle and the volume of a cube .
on may 16 china stated it had also received $ 457 million in donated money and goods for rescue efforts so far , including $ 83 million from 19 countries and four international organizations . saudi arabia was the largest aid donor to china , providing close to € 40,000,000 in financial assistance , and an additional € 8,000,000 worth of relief materials .
west of the rocky mountains lies the intermontane plateaus ( also known as the intermountain west ) , a large , arid desert lying between the rockies and the cascades and sierra nevada ranges . the large southern portion , known as the great basin , consists of salt flats , drainage basins , and many small north-south mountain ranges . the southwest is predominantly a low-lying desert region . a portion known as the colorado plateau , centered around the four corners region , is considered to have some of the most spectacular scenery in the world . it is accentuated in such national parks as grand canyon , arches , mesa verde national park and bryce canyon , among others . other smaller intermontane areas include the columbia plateau covering eastern washington , western idaho and northeast oregon and the snake river plain in southern idaho .
the houston-the woodlands-sugar land metropolitan area is served by one public television station and two public radio stations . kuht ( houstonpbs ) is a pbs member station and is the first public television station in the united states . houston public radio is listener-funded and comprises two npr member stations : kuhf ( kuhf news ) and kuha ( classical 91.7 ) . kuhf is news / talk radio and kuha is a classical music station . the university of houston system owns and holds broadcasting licenses to kuht , kuhf , and kuha . the stations broadcast from the melcher center for public broadcasting , located on the campus of the university of houston .
typically , matches are staged between a protagonist ( historically an audience favorite , known as a babyface , or " the good guy " ) and an antagonist ( historically a villain with arrogance , a tendency to break rules , or other unlikable qualities , called a heel ) . in recent years , however , antiheroes have also become prominent in professional wrestling . there is also a less common role of a " tweener , " who is neither fully face nor fully heel yet able to play either role effectively ( case in point , samoa joe during his first run in tna from june 2005 to november 2006 ) .
in 2013 tourism within the state from local citizens accounted for 39.9 % of tourists , the second highest originating location for tourists to tennessee is the state of georgia , accounting for 8.4 % of tourists . : 17 forty-four percent of stays in the state were " day trips , " 25 % stayed one night , 15 % stayed two nights , and 11 % stayed 4 or more nights . the average stay was 2.16 nights , compared to 2.03 nights for the us as a whole . : 40 the average person spent $ 118 per day : 29 % on transportation , 24 % on food , 17 % on accommodation , and 28 % on shopping and entertainment . : 44
imperial college boat clubthe imperial college boat club was founded on 12 december 1919 . the gold medal winning gb 8 + at the 2000 sydney olympics had been based at imperial college 's recently refurbished boathouse and included 3 alumni of the college along with their coach martin mcelroy . the club has been highly successful , with many wins at henley royal regatta including most recently in 2013 with victory in the prince albert challenge cup event . the club has been home to numerous national squad oarsmen and women and is open to all rowers not just students of imperial college london .
in markets where a digital transmitter was installed , existing coverage areas were not necessarily maintained . for instance , the cbc implemented a digital transmitter covering fredericton , new brunswick in the place of the existing transmitter covering saint john , new brunswick and fredericton , and decided to maintain analogue service to saint john . according to cbc 's application for this transmitter to the crtc , the population served by the digital transmitter would be 113,930 people versus 303,465 served by the existing analogue transmitter . in victoria , the replacement of the vancouver analogue transmitters with digital ones only allowed only some northeastern parts of the metropolitan area ( total population 330,000 ) to receive either cbc or radio-canada .
from september 1823 to 1826 chopin attended the warsaw lyceum , where he received organ lessons from the czech musician wilhelm wurfel during his first year . in the autumn of 1826 he began a three-year course under the silesian composer jozef elsner at the warsaw conservatory , studying music theory , figured bass and composition . [ n 3 ] throughout this period he continued to compose and to give recitals in concerts and salons in warsaw . he was engaged by the inventors of a mechanical organ , the " eolomelodicon , " and on this instrument in may 1825 he performed his own improvisation and part of a concerto by moscheles . the success of this concert led to an invitation to give a similar recital on the instrument before tsar alexander i , who was visiting warsaw ; the tsar presented him with a diamond ring . at a subsequent eolomelodicon concert on 10 june 1825 , chopin performed his rondo op. 1 . this was the first of his works to be commercially published and earned him his first mention in the foreign press , when the leipzig allgemeine musikalische zeitung praised his " wealth of musical ideas . "
some usb devices require more power than is permitted by the specifications for a single port . this is common for external hard and optical disc drives , and generally for devices with motors or lamps . such devices can use an external power supply , which is allowed by the standard , or use a dual-input usb cable , one input of which is used for power and data transfer , the other solely for power , which makes the device a non-standard usb device . some usb ports and external hubs can , in practice , supply more power to usb devices than required by the specification but a standard-compliant device may not depend on this .
the bulgarian empire was in decline by the 14th century , and the ascendancy of serbia was marked by the serbian victory over the bulgarians in the battle of velbazhd in 1330 . by 1346 , the serbian king stefan dusan had been proclaimed emperor . yet serbian dominance was short-lived ; the serbian army led by the lazar hrebljevanovic was defeated by the ottomans at the battle of kosovo in 1389 , where most of the serbian nobility was killed and the south of the country came under ottoman occupation , as much of southern bulgaria had become ottoman territory in 1371 . northern remnants of bulgaria were finally conquered by 1396 , serbia fell in 1459 , bosnia in 1463 , and albania was finally subordinated in 1479 only a few years after the death of skanderbeg . belgrade , an hungarian domain at the time , was the last large balkan city to fall under ottoman rule , in 1521 . by the end of the medieval period , the entire balkan peninsula was annexed by , or became vassal to , the ottomans .
the convergence of these various sources into a uniform theory of groups started with camille jordan 's traite des substitutions et des equations algebriques ( 1870 ) . walther von dyck ( 1882 ) introduced the idea of specifying a group by means of generators and relations , and was also the first to give an axiomatic definition of an " abstract group , " in the terminology of the time . as of the 20th century , groups gained wide recognition by the pioneering work of ferdinand georg frobenius and william burnside , who worked on representation theory of finite groups , richard brauer 's modular representation theory and issai schur 's papers . the theory of lie groups , and more generally locally compact groups was studied by hermann weyl , elie cartan and many others . its algebraic counterpart , the theory of algebraic groups , was first shaped by claude chevalley ( from the late 1930s ) and later by the work of armand borel and jacques tits .
a resin used for making non-wrinkle shirts releases formaldehyde , which could cause contact dermatitis for some people ; no disclosure requirements exist , and in 2008 the u.s. government accountability office tested formaldehyde in clothing and found that generally the highest levels were in non-wrinkle shirts and pants . in 1999 , a study of the effect of washing on the formaldehyde levels found that after 6 months after washing , 7 of 27 shirts had levels in excess of 75 ppm , which is a safe limit for direct skin exposure .
the allies offered peace terms in the frankfurt proposals in november 1813 . napoleon would remain as emperor of france , but it would be reduced to its " natural frontiers . " that meant that france could retain control of belgium , savoy and the rhineland ( the west bank of the rhine river ) , while giving up control of all the rest , including all of spain and the netherlands , and most of italy and germany . metternich told napoleon these were the best terms the allies were likely to offer ; after further victories , the terms would be harsher and harsher . metternich 's motivation was to maintain france as a balance against russian threats , while ending the highly destabilizing series of wars .
zen buddhism ( 禅 ) , pronounced chan in chinese , seon in korean or zen in japanese ( derived from the sanskrit term dhyana , meaning " meditation " ) is a form of buddhism that became popular in china , korea and japan and that lays special emphasis on meditation . [ note 12 ] zen places less emphasis on scriptures than some other forms of buddhism and prefers to focus on direct spiritual breakthroughs to truth .
two annual productions are especially notable : the waa-mu show , and the dolphin show . waa-mu is an original musical , written and produced almost entirely by students . children 's theater is represented on campus by griffin 's tale and purple crayon players . its umbrella organization - the student theatre coalition , or stuco , organizes nine student theatre companies , multiple performance groups and more than sixty independent productions each year . many northwestern alumni have used these productions as stepping stones to successful television and film careers . chicago 's lookingglass theatre company , for example , which began life in the great room in jones residential college , was founded in 1988 by several alumni , including david schwimmer ; in 2011 , it won the regional tony award .
the use of diversionary techniques such as fires had to be made carefully . the fake fires could only begin when the bombing started over an adjacent target and its effects were brought under control . too early and the chances of success receded ; too late and the real conflagration at the target would exceed the diversionary fires . another innovation was the boiler fire . these units were fed from two adjacent tanks containing oil and water . the oil-fed fires were then injected with water from time to time ; the flashes produced were similar to those of the german c-250 and c-500 flammbomben . the hope was that , if it could deceive german bombardiers , it would draw more bombers away from the real target .
the age of the earth is about 4.54 billion years old . the earliest undisputed evidence of life on earth dates at least from 3.5 billion years ago , during the eoarchean era after a geological crust started to solidify following the earlier molten hadean eon . there are microbial mat fossils found in 3.48 billion-year-old sandstone discovered in western australia . other early physical evidence of a biogenic substance is graphite in 3.7 billion-year-old metasedimentary rocks discovered in western greenland . more recently , in 2015 , " remains of biotic life " were found in 4.1 billion-year-old rocks in western australia . according to one of the researchers , " if life arose relatively quickly on earth ... then it could be common in the universe . "
from 1955 until 1997 sichuan had been china 's most populous province , hitting 100 million mark shortly after the 1982 census figure of 99,730,000 . this changed in 1997 when the sub-provincial city of chongqing as well as the three surrounding prefectures of fuling , wanxian , and qianjiang were split off into the new chongqing municipality . the new municipality was formed to spearhead china 's effort to economically develop its western provinces , as well as to coordinate the resettlement of residents from the reservoir areas of the three gorges dam project .
chopin 's tombstone , featuring the muse of music , euterpe , weeping over a broken lyre , was designed and sculpted by clesinger . the expenses of the funeral and monument , amounting to 5,000 francs , were covered by jane stirling , who also paid for the return of the composer 's sister ludwika to warsaw . ludwika took chopin 's heart in an urn , preserved in alcohol , back to poland in 1850 . [ n 9 ] she also took a collection of two hundred letters from sand to chopin ; after 1851 these were returned to sand , who seems to have destroyed them .
the school has many nationally and internationally acclaimed scholars in social security , health care , health disparities , communication , social and health policy , and individual and family development . many of the faculty have training in both social work and public health . the school 's current dean is edward f. lawlor . in addition to affiliation with the university-wide institute of public health , brown houses 12 research centers . the brown school library collects materials on many topics , with specific emphasis on : children , youth , and families ; gerontology ; health ; mental health ; social and economic development ; family therapy ; and management . the library maintains subscriptions to over 450 academic journals .
karlheinz brandenburg used a cd recording of suzanne vega 's song " tom 's diner " to assess and refine the mp3 compression algorithm . this song was chosen because of its nearly monophonic nature and wide spectral content , making it easier to hear imperfections in the compression format during playbacks . some refer to suzanne vega as " the mother of mp3 . " this particular track has an interesting property in that the two channels are almost , but not completely , the same , leading to a case where binaural masking level depression causes spatial unmasking of noise artifacts unless the encoder properly recognizes the situation and applies corrections similar to those detailed in the mpeg-2 aac psychoacoustic model . some more critical audio excerpts ( glockenspiel , triangle , accordion , etc . ) were taken from the ebu v3 / sqam reference compact disc and have been used by professional sound engineers to assess the subjective quality of the mpeg audio formats .
the evidence of the early texts suggests that siddhartha gautama was born in a community that was on the periphery , both geographically and culturally , of the northeastern indian subcontinent in the fifth century bce . it was either a small republic , in which case his father was an elected chieftain , or an oligarchy , in which case his father was an oligarch .
the scn projects to a set of areas in the hypothalamus , brainstem , and midbrain that are involved in implementing sleep-wake cycles . an important component of the system is the reticular formation , a group of neuron-clusters scattered diffusely through the core of the lower brain . reticular neurons send signals to the thalamus , which in turn sends activity-level-controlling signals to every part of the cortex . damage to the reticular formation can produce a permanent state of coma .
after the president signs a bill into law ( or congress enacts it over his veto ) , it is delivered to the office of the federal register ( ofr ) of the national archives and records administration ( nara ) where it is assigned a law number , and prepared for publication as a slip law . public laws , but not private laws , are also given legal statutory citation by the ofr . at the end of each session of congress , the slip laws are compiled into bound volumes called the united states statutes at large , and they are known as session laws . the statutes at large present a chronological arrangement of the laws in the exact order that they have been enacted .
southeast tucson continues to experience rapid residential development . the area includes davis-monthan air force base . the area is considered to be south of golf links road . it is the home of santa rita high school , chuck ford park ( lakeside park ) , lakeside lake , lincoln park ( upper and lower ) , the lakecrest neighborhoods , and pima community college east campus . the atterbury wash with its access to excellent bird watching is also located in the southeast tucson area . the suburban community of rita ranch houses many of the military families from davis-monthan , and is near the southeastern-most expansion of the current city limits . close by rita ranch and also within the city limits lies civano , a planned development meant to showcase ecologically sound building practices and lifestyles .
in 1874 , telegraph message traffic was rapidly expanding and in the words of western union president william orton , had become " the nervous system of commerce . " orton had contracted with inventors thomas edison and elisha gray to find a way to send multiple telegraph messages on each telegraph line to avoid the great cost of constructing new lines . when bell mentioned to gardiner hubbard and thomas sanders that he was working on a method of sending multiple tones on a telegraph wire using a multi-reed device , the two wealthy patrons began to financially support bell 's experiments . patent matters would be handled by hubbard 's patent attorney , anthony pollok .
y dna studies tend to imply a small number of founders in an old population whose members parted and followed different migration paths . in most jewish populations , these male line ancestors appear to have been mainly middle eastern . for example , ashkenazi jews share more common paternal lineages with other jewish and middle eastern groups than with non-jewish populations in areas where jews lived in eastern europe , germany and the french rhine valley . this is consistent with jewish traditions in placing most jewish paternal origins in the region of the middle east . conversely , the maternal lineages of jewish populations , studied by looking at mitochondrial dna , are generally more heterogeneous . scholars such as harry ostrer and raphael falk believe this indicates that many jewish males found new mates from european and other communities in the places where they migrated in the diaspora after fleeing ancient israel . in contrast , behar has found evidence that about 40 % of ashkenazi jews originate maternally from just four female founders , who were of middle eastern origin . the populations of sephardi and mizrahi jewish communities " showed no evidence for a narrow founder effect . " subsequent studies carried out by feder et al. confirmed the large portion of non-local maternal origin among ashkenazi jews . reflecting on their findings related to the maternal origin of ashkenazi jews , the authors conclude " clearly , the differences between jews and non-jews are far larger than those observed among the jewish communities . hence , differences between the jewish communities can be overlooked when non-jews are included in the comparisons . "
in a 2009 case , netbula , llc v. chordiant software inc . , defendant chordiant filed a motion to compel netbula to disable the robots.txt file on its web site that was causing the wayback machine to retroactively remove access to previous versions of pages it had archived from nebula 's site , pages that chordiant believed would support its case .
in northern galicia , the a coruna-ferrol metropolitan area has become increasingly dominant in terms of population . the population of the city of a coruna in 1900 was 43,971 . the population of the rest of the province including the city and naval station of nearby ferrol and santiago de compostela was 653,556 . a coruna 's growth occurred after the spanish civil war at the same speed as other major galician cities , but it was the arrival of democracy in spain after the death of francisco franco when a coruna left all the other galician cities behind .
while there is some dispute as to the matter of influence , popper had a long-standing and close friendship with economist friedrich hayek , who was also brought to the london school of economics from vienna . each found support and similarities in the other 's work , citing each other often , though not without qualification . in a letter to hayek in 1944 , popper stated , " i think i have learnt more from you than from any other living thinker , except perhaps alfred tarski . " popper dedicated his conjectures and refutations to hayek . for his part , hayek dedicated a collection of papers , studies in philosophy , politics , and economics , to popper , and in 1982 said , ... " ever since his logik der forschung first came out in 1934 , i have been a complete adherent to his general theory of methodology . "
the advent of the industrial revolution in britain provided a great boost to cotton manufacture , as textiles emerged as britain 's leading export . in 1738 , lewis paul and john wyatt , of birmingham , england , patented the roller spinning machine , as well as the flyer-and-bobbin system for drawing cotton to a more even thickness using two sets of rollers that traveled at different speeds . later , the invention of the james hargreaves ' spinning jenny in 1764 , richard arkwright 's spinning frame in 1769 and samuel crompton 's spinning mule in 1775 enabled british spinners to produce cotton yarn at much higher rates . from the late 18th century on , the british city of manchester acquired the nickname " cottonopolis " due to the cotton industry 's omnipresence within the city , and manchester 's role as the heart of the global cotton trade .
in september 2007 , during a lawsuit with patent holding company burst.com , apple drew attention to a patent for a similar device that was developed in 1979 . kane kramer applied for a uk patent for his design of a " plastic music box " in 1981 , which he called the ixi . he was unable to secure funding to renew the us $ 120,000 worldwide patent , so it lapsed and kramer never profited from his idea .
russell 's ministry , though whig , was not favoured by the queen . she found particularly offensive the foreign secretary , lord palmerston , who often acted without consulting the cabinet , the prime minister , or the queen . victoria complained to russell that palmerston sent official dispatches to foreign leaders without her knowledge , but palmerston was retained in office and continued to act on his own initiative , despite her repeated remonstrances . it was only in 1851 that palmerston was removed after he announced the british government 's approval of president louis-napoleon bonaparte 's coup in france without consulting the prime minister . the following year , president bonaparte was declared emperor napoleon iii , by which time russell 's administration had been replaced by a short-lived minority government led by lord derby .
universal studios inc . ( also known as universal pictures ) is an american film studio , owned by comcast through its wholly owned subsidiary nbcuniversal , and is one of hollywood 's " big six " film studios . its production studios are at 100 universal city plaza drive in universal city , california . distribution and other corporate offices are in new york city . universal studios is a member of the motion picture association of america ( mpaa ) . universal was founded in 1912 by the german carl laemmle ( pronounced " lem-lee " ) , mark dintenfass , charles o. baumann , adam kessel , pat powers , william swanson , david horsley , robert h. cochrane , and jules brulatour .
during the years immediately following the novel 's publication , harper lee enjoyed the attention its popularity garnered her , granting interviews , visiting schools , and attending events honoring the book . in 1961 , when to kill a mockingbird was in its 41st week on the bestseller list , it was awarded the pulitzer prize , stunning lee . it also won the brotherhood award of the national conference of christians and jews in the same year , and the paperback of the year award from bestsellers magazine in 1962 . starting in 1964 , lee began to turn down interviews , complaining that the questions were monotonous , and grew concerned that attention she received bordered on the kind of publicity celebrities sought . since the , she declined talking with reporters about the book . she also steadfastly refused to provide an introduction , writing in 1995 : " introductions inhibit pleasure , they kill the joy of anticipation , they frustrate curiosity . the only good thing about introductions is that in some cases they delay the dose to come . mockingbird still says what it has to say ; it has managed to survive the years without preamble . "
according to one of her biographers , giles st aubyn , victoria wrote an average of 2,500 words a day during her adult life . from july 1832 until just before her death , she kept a detailed journal , which eventually encompassed 122 volumes . after victoria 's death , her youngest daughter , princess beatrice , was appointed her literary executor . beatrice transcribed and edited the diaries covering victoria 's accession onwards , and burned the originals in the process . despite this destruction , much of the diaries still exist . in addition to beatrice 's edited copy , lord esher transcribed the volumes from 1832 to 1861 before beatrice destroyed them . part of victoria 's extensive correspondence has been published in volumes edited by a. c. benson , hector bolitho , george earle buckle , lord esher , roger fulford , and richard hough among others .
the agglomeration of kathmandu has not yet been officially defined . the urban area of the kathmandu valley is split among three different districts ( collections of local government units within a zone ) which extend very little beyond the valley fringe , except towards the southern ranges , which have comparatively small population . they have the three highest population densities in the country . within the districts lie vdcs ( villages ) , 3 municipalities ( bhaktapur , kirtipur , madhyapur thimi ) , 1 sub-metropolitan city ( lalitpur ) , and 1 metropolitan city ( kathmandu ) . some district subdivisions remain legally villages yet are densely populated , gonggabu vdc notably recorded a density over 20,000 people / km2 . ( 2011 census ) . the following data table describes the districts considered part of the agglomeration :
thermally , a temperate glacier is at melting point throughout the year , from its surface to its base . the ice of a polar glacier is always below freezing point from the surface to its base , although the surface snowpack may experience seasonal melting . a sub-polar glacier includes both temperate and polar ice , depending on depth beneath the surface and position along the length of the glacier . in a similar way , the thermal regime of a glacier is often described by the temperature at its base alone . a cold-based glacier is below freezing at the ice-ground interface , and is thus frozen to the underlying substrate . a warm-based glacier is above or at freezing at the interface , and is able to slide at this contact . this contrast is thought to a large extent to govern the ability of a glacier to effectively erode its bed , as sliding ice promotes plucking at rock from the surface below . glaciers which are partly cold-based and partly warm-based are known as polythermal .
myanmar 's armed forces are known as the tatmadaw , which numbers 488,000 . the tatmadaw comprises the army , the navy , and the air force . the country ranked twelfth in the world for its number of active troops in service . the military is very influential in myanmar , with all top cabinet and ministry posts usually held by military officials . official figures for military spending are not available . estimates vary widely because of uncertain exchange rates , but myanmar 's military forces ' expenses are high . myanmar imports most of its weapons from russia , ukraine , china and india .
the early qing emperors adopted the bureaucratic structures and institutions from the preceding ming dynasty but split rule between han chinese and manchus , with some positions also given to mongols . like previous dynasties , the qing recruited officials via the imperial examination system , until the system was abolished in 1905 . the qing divided the positions into civil and military positions , each having nine grades or ranks , each subdivided into a and b categories . civil appointments ranged from attendant to the emperor or a grand secretary in the forbidden city ( highest ) to being a prefectural tax collector , deputy jail warden , deputy police commissioner or tax examiner . military appointments ranged from being a field marshal or chamberlain of the imperial bodyguard to a third class sergeant , corporal or a first or second class private .
in lossy audio compression , methods of psychoacoustics are used to remove non-audible ( or less audible ) components of the audio signal . compression of human speech is often performed with even more specialized techniques ; speech coding , or voice coding , is sometimes distinguished as a separate discipline from audio compression . different audio and speech compression standards are listed under audio coding formats . voice compression is used in internet telephony , for example , audio compression is used for cd ripping and is decoded by the audio players .
state banquets also take place in the ballroom ; these formal dinners are held on the first evening of a state visit by a foreign head of state . on these occasions , for up to 170 guests in formal " white tie and decorations , " including tiaras , the dining table is laid with the grand service , a collection of silver-gilt plate made in 1811 for the prince of wales , later george iv . the largest and most formal reception at buckingham palace takes place every november when the queen entertains members of the diplomatic corps . on this grand occasion , all the state rooms are in use , as the royal family proceed through them , beginning at the great north doors of the picture gallery . as nash had envisaged , all the large , double-mirrored doors stand open , reflecting the numerous crystal chandeliers and sconces , creating a deliberate optical illusion of space and light .
the emperor diocletian ( r . 284-305 ) split the empire into separately administered eastern and western halves in 286 ; the empire was not considered divided by its inhabitants or rulers , as legal and administrative promulgations in one division were considered valid in the other . [ c ] in 330 , after a period of civil war , constantine the great ( r . 306-337 ) refounded the city of byzantium as the newly renamed eastern capital , constantinople . diocletian 's reforms strengthened the governmental bureaucracy , reformed taxation , and strengthened the army , which bought the empire time but did not resolve the problems it was facing : excessive taxation , a declining birthrate , and pressures on its frontiers , among others . civil war between rival emperors became common in the middle of the 4th century , diverting soldiers from the empire 's frontier forces and allowing invaders to encroach . for much of the 4th century , roman society stabilised in a new form that differed from the earlier classical period , with a widening gulf between the rich and poor , and a decline in the vitality of the smaller towns . another change was the christianisation , or conversion of the empire to christianity , a gradual process that lasted from the 2nd to the 5th centuries .
the last major building work took place during the reign of king george v when , in 1913 , sir aston webb redesigned blore 's 1850 east front to resemble in part giacomo leoni 's lyme park in cheshire . this new , refaced principal facade ( of portland stone ) was designed to be the backdrop to the victoria memorial , a large memorial statue of queen victoria , placed outside the main gates . george v , who had succeeded edward vii in 1910 , had a more serious personality than his father ; greater emphasis was now placed on official entertaining and royal duties than on lavish parties . he arranged a series of command performances featuring jazz musicians such as the original dixieland jazz band ( 1919 ) - the first jazz performance for a head of state , sidney bechet , and louis armstrong ( 1932 ) , which earned the palace a nomination in 2009 for a ( kind of ) blue plaque by the brecon jazz festival as one of the venues making the greatest contribution to jazz music in the united kingdom . george v 's wife queen mary was a connoisseur of the arts , and took a keen interest in the royal collection of furniture and art , both restoring and adding to it . queen mary also had many new fixtures and fittings installed , such as the pair of marble empire-style chimneypieces by benjamin vulliamy , dating from 1810 , which the queen had installed in the ground floor bow room , the huge low room at the centre of the garden facade . queen mary was also responsible for the decoration of the blue drawing room . this room , 69 feet ( 21 metres ) long , previously known as the south drawing room , has a ceiling designed specially by nash , coffered with huge gilt console brackets .
acid-fast bacteria , such as mycobacteria , are resistant to decolorization by acids during staining procedures . the high mycolic acid content of mycobacteria , is responsible for the staining pattern of poor absorption followed by high retention . the most common staining technique used to identify acid-fast bacteria is the ziehl-neelsen stain or acid-fast stain , in which the acid-fast bacilli are stained bright-red and stand out clearly against a blue background . l-form bacteria are strains of bacteria that lack cell walls . the main pathogenic bacteria in this class is mycoplasma ( not to be confused with mycobacteria ) .
neoclassical architecture was introduced in malta in the late 18th century , during the final years of hospitaller rule . early examples include the bibliotheca ( 1786 ) , the de rohan arch ( 1798 ) and the hompesch gate ( 1801 ) . however , neoclassical architecture only became popular in malta following the establishment of british rule in the early 19th century . in 1814 , a neoclassical portico decorated with the british coat of arms was added to the main guard building so as to serve as a symbol of british malta . other 19th century neoclassical buildings include rnh bighi ( 1832 ) , st paul 's pro-cathedral ( 1844 ) , the rotunda of mosta ( 1860 ) and the now destroyed royal opera house ( 1866 ) .
in the early stages of the first punic war ( 264 bc ) the first known roman gladiatorial munus was held , described as a funeral blood-rite to the manes of a roman military aristocrat . the gladiator munus was never explicitly acknowledged as a human sacrifice , probably because death was not its inevitable outcome or purpose . even so , the gladiators swore their lives to the infernal gods , and the combat was dedicated as an offering to the di manes or other gods . the event was therefore a sacrificium in the strict sense of the term , and christian writers later condemned it as human sacrifice .
metrobus transit is responsible for public transit in the region . metrobus has a total of 19 routes , 53 buses and an annual ridership of 3,014,073 . destinations include the avalon mall , the village shopping centre , memorial university , academy canada , the college of the north atlantic , the marine institute , the confederation building , downtown , stavanger drive business park , kelsey drive , goulds , kilbride , shea heights , the four hospitals in the city as well as other important areas in st. john 's and mount pearl .
there are three primary shopping centers in the bronx : the hub , gateway center and southern boulevard . the hub-third avenue business improvement district ( b.i.d. ) , in the hub , is the retail heart of the south bronx , located where four roads converge : east 149th street , willis , melrose and third avenues . it is primarily located inside the neighborhood of melrose but also lines the northern border of mott haven . the hub has been called " the broadway of the bronx , " being likened to the real broadway in manhattan and the northwestern bronx . it is the site of both maximum traffic and architectural density . in configuration , it resembles a miniature times square , a spatial " bow-tie " created by the geometry of the street . the hub is part of bronx community board 1 .
rather than teach small parts of a large number of subjects , whitehead advocated teaching a relatively few important concepts that the student could organically link to many different areas of knowledge , discovering their application in actual life . for whitehead , education should be the exact opposite of the multidisciplinary , value-free school model - it should be transdisciplinary , and laden with values and general principles that provide students with a bedrock of wisdom and help them to make connections between areas of knowledge that are usually regarded as separate .
historians luciano petech and sato hisashi argue that the ming upheld a " divide-and-rule " policy towards a weak and politically fragmented tibet after the sakya regime had fallen . chan writes that this was perhaps the calculated strategy of the yongle emperor , as exclusive patronage to one tibetan sect would have given it too much regional power . sperling finds no textual evidence in either chinese or tibetan sources to support this thesis of petech and hisashi . norbu asserts that their thesis is largely based on the list of ming titles conferred on tibetan lamas rather than " comparative analysis of developments in china and tibet . " rossabi states that this theory " attributes too much influence to the chinese , " pointing out that tibet was already politically divided when the ming dynasty began . rossabi also discounts the " divide-and-rule " theory on the grounds of the yongle emperor 's failed attempt to build a strong relationship with the fifth karmapa - one which he hoped would parallel kublai khan 's earlier relationship with the sakya phagpa lama . instead , the yongle emperor followed the karmapa 's advice of giving patronage to many different tibetan lamas .
evidence from the early technical literature concerning electrical recording suggests that it wasn 't until the 1942-1949 period that there were serious efforts to standardize recording characteristics within an industry . heretofore , electrical recording technology from company to company was considered a proprietary art all the way back to the 1925 western electric licensed method used by columbia and victor . for example , what brunswick-balke-collender ( brunswick corporation ) did was different from the practices of victor .
citing the inability of the joint commission to make progress , the u.s. government decided to hold an election under united nations auspices with the aim of creating an independent korea . the soviet authorities and the korean communists refused to co-operate on the grounds it would not be fair , and many south korean politicians also boycotted it . a general election was held in the south on 10 may 1948 . it was marred by terrorism and sabotage resulting in 600 deaths . north korea held parliamentary elections three months later on 25 august .
the time warner cable music pavilion at walnut creek hosts major international touring acts . in 2011 , the downtown raleigh amphitheater opened ( now sponsored as the red hat amphitheater ) , which hosts numerous concerts primarily in the summer months . an additional amphitheater sits on the grounds of the north carolina museum of art , which hosts a summer concert series and outdoor movies . nearby cary is home to the koka booth amphitheatre which hosts additional summer concerts and outdoor movies , and serves as the venue for regularly scheduled outdoor concerts by the north carolina symphony based in raleigh . during the north carolina state fair , dorton arena hosts headline acts . the private lincoln theatre is one of several clubs in downtown raleigh that schedules many concerts throughout the year in multiple formats ( rock , pop , country ) .
visual anthropology is concerned , in part , with the study and production of ethnographic photography , film and , since the mid-1990s , new media . while the term is sometimes used interchangeably with ethnographic film , visual anthropology also encompasses the anthropological study of visual representation , including areas such as performance , museums , art , and the production and reception of mass media . visual representations from all cultures , such as sandpaintings , tattoos , sculptures and reliefs , cave paintings , scrimshaw , jewelry , hieroglyphics , paintings and photographs are included in the focus of visual anthropology .
changes to dst rules cause problems in existing computer installations . for example , the 2007 change to dst rules in north america required many computer systems to be upgraded , with the greatest impact on email and calendaring programs ; the upgrades consumed a significant effort by corporate information technologists .
commercially cultivated grapes can usually be classified as either table or wine grapes , based on their intended method of consumption : eaten raw ( table grapes ) or used to make wine ( wine grapes ) . while almost all of them belong to the same species , vitis vinifera , table and wine grapes have significant differences , brought about through selective breeding . table grape cultivars tend to have large , seedless fruit ( see below ) with relatively thin skin . wine grapes are smaller , usually seeded , and have relatively thick skins ( a desirable characteristic in winemaking , since much of the aroma in wine comes from the skin ) . wine grapes also tend to be very sweet : they are harvested at the time when their juice is approximately 24 % sugar by weight . by comparison , commercially produced " 100 % grape juice , " made from table grapes , is usually around 15 % sugar by weight .
frequencies for compass are allocated in four bands : e1 , e2 , e5b , and e6 and overlap with galileo . the fact of overlapping could be convenient from the point of view of the receiver design , but on the other hand raises the issues of inter-system interference , especially within e1 and e2 bands , which are allocated for galileo 's publicly regulated service . however , under international telecommunication union ( itu ) policies , the first nation to start broadcasting in a specific frequency will have priority to that frequency , and any subsequent users will be required to obtain permission prior to using that frequency , and otherwise ensure that their broadcasts do not interfere with the original nation 's broadcasts . it now appears that chinese compass satellites will start transmitting in the e1 , e2 , e5b , and e6 bands before europe 's galileo satellites and thus have primary rights to these frequency ranges .
after the ceasefire following the fall of france in june 1940 , alsace was annexed to germany and a rigorous policy of germanisation was imposed upon it by the gauleiter robert heinrich wagner . when , in july 1940 , the first evacuees were allowed to return , only residents of alsatian origin were admitted . the last jews were deported on 15 july 1940 and the main synagogue , a huge romanesque revival building that had been a major architectural landmark with its 54-metre-high dome since its completion in 1897 , was set ablaze , then razed .
sometimes circumstances such as a good breeding season followed by a food source failure the following year lead to irruptions in which large numbers of a species move far beyond the normal range . bohemian waxwings bombycilla garrulus well show this unpredictable variation in annual numbers , with five major arrivals in britain during the nineteenth century , but 18 between the years 1937 and 2000 . red crossbills loxia curvirostra too are irruptive , with widespread invasions across england noted in 1251 , 1593 , 1757 , and 1791 .

the definition of antenna gain or power gain already includes the effect of the antenna 's efficiency . therefore , if one is trying to radiate a signal toward a receiver using a transmitter of a given power , one need only compare the gain of various antennas rather than considering the efficiency as well . this is likewise true for a receiving antenna at very high ( especially microwave ) frequencies , where the point is to receive a signal which is strong compared to the receiver 's noise temperature . however , in the case of a directional antenna used for receiving signals with the intention of rejecting interference from different directions , one is no longer concerned with the antenna efficiency , as discussed above . in this case , rather than quoting the antenna gain , one would be more concerned with the directive gain which does not include the effect of antenna ( in ) efficiency . the directive gain of an antenna can be computed from the published gain divided by the antenna 's efficiency .
the depression had devastating effects in virtually every country , rich or poor . international trade plunged by half to two-thirds , as did personal income , tax revenue , prices and profits . cities all around the world were hit hard , especially those dependent on heavy industry . construction was virtually halted in many countries . farming and rural areas suffered as crop prices fell by roughly 60 percent . facing plummeting demand with few alternate sources of jobs , areas dependent on primary sector industries suffered the most .
arsenal fans often refer to themselves as " gooners , " the name derived from the team 's nickname , " the gunners . " the fanbase is large and generally loyal , and virtually all home matches sell out ; in 2007-08 arsenal had the second-highest average league attendance for an english club ( 60,070 , which was 99.5 % of available capacity ) , and , as of 2015 , the third-highest all-time average attendance . arsenal have the seventh highest average attendance of european football clubs only behind borussia dortmund , fc barcelona , manchester united , real madrid , bayern munich , and schalke . the club 's location , adjoining wealthy areas such as canonbury and barnsbury , mixed areas such as islington , holloway , highbury , and the adjacent london borough of camden , and largely working-class areas such as finsbury park and stoke newington , has meant that arsenal 's supporters have come from a variety of social classes .
dante alighieri 's divine comedy , derived features of and episodes about bolgia from arabic works on islamic eschatology : the hadith and the kitab al-miraj ( translated into latin in 1264 or shortly before as liber scale machometi ) concerning the ascension to heaven of muhammad , and the spiritual writings of ibn arabi . the moors also had a noticeable influence on the works of george peele and william shakespeare . some of their works featured moorish characters , such as peele 's the battle of alcazar and shakespeare 's the merchant of venice , titus andronicus and othello , which featured a moorish othello as its title character . these works are said to have been inspired by several moorish delegations from morocco to elizabethan england at the beginning of the 17th century .
in 1962 , the supreme court addressed the issue of officially-sponsored prayer or religious recitations in public schools . in engel v. vitale , 370 u.s. 421 ( 1962 ) , the court , by a vote of 6-1 , determined it unconstitutional for state officials to compose an official school prayer and require its recitation in public schools , even when the prayer is non-denominational and students may excuse themselves from participation . ( the prayer required by the new york state board of regents prior to the court 's decision consisted of : " almighty god , we acknowledge our dependence upon thee , and we beg thy blessings upon us , our parents , our teachers , and our country . amen . " ) as the court stated :
in 2013 a lot of media coverage was given to unclassified nsa 's study in cryptologic spectrum that concluded that tito did not speak the language as a native , and had features of other slavic languages ( russian and polish ) . the hypothesis that " a non-yugoslav , perhaps a russian or a pole " assumed tito 's identity was included . the report also notes draza mihailovic 's impressions of tito 's russian origins .
the democrats gained a majority in both houses in the 1954 election . eisenhower had to work with the democratic majority leader lyndon b. johnson ( later u.s. president ) in the senate and speaker sam rayburn in the house , both from texas . joe martin , the republican speaker from 1947 to 1949 and again from 1953 to 1955 , wrote that eisenhower " never surrounded himself with assistants who could solve political problems with professional skill . there were exceptions , leonard w. hall , for example , who as chairman of the republican national committee tried to open the administration 's eyes to the political facts of life , with occasional success . however , these exceptions were not enough to right the balance . "
vinyl records do not break easily , but the soft material is easily scratched . vinyl readily acquires a static charge , attracting dust that is difficult to remove completely . dust and scratches cause audio clicks and pops . in extreme cases , they can cause the needle to skip over a series of grooves , or worse yet , cause the needle to skip backwards , creating a " locked groove " that repeats over and over . this is the origin of the phrase " like a broken record " or " like a scratched record , " which is often used to describe a person or thing that continually repeats itself . locked grooves are not uncommon and were even heard occasionally in radio broadcasts .
since the late 1980s , significant development has occurred in the bronx , first stimulated by the city 's " ten-year housing plan " and community members working to rebuild the social , economic and environmental infrastructure by creating affordable housing . groups affiliated with churches in the south bronx erected the nehemiah homes with about 1,000 units . the grass roots organization nos quedamos ' endeavor known as melrose commons began to rebuild areas in the south bronx . the irt white plains road line ( 2 5 trains ) began to show an increase in riders . chains such as marshalls , staples , and target opened stores in the bronx . more bank branches opened in the bronx as a whole ( rising from 106 in 1997 to 149 in 2007 ) , although not primarily in poor or minority neighborhoods , while the bronx still has fewer branches per person than other boroughs .
asthma as a result of ( or worsened by ) workplace exposures , is a commonly reported occupational disease . many cases however are not reported or recognized as such . it is estimated that 5-25 % of asthma cases in adults are work-related . a few hundred different agents have been implicated with the most common being : isocyanates , grain and wood dust , colophony , soldering flux , latex , animals , and aldehydes . the employment associated with the highest risk of problems include : those who spray paint , bakers and those who process food , nurses , chemical workers , those who work with animals , welders , hairdressers and timber workers .
most of the subcontinent was conquered by the maurya empire during the 4th and 3rd centuries bce . from the 3rd century bc onwards prakrit and pali literature in the north and the sangam literature in southern india started to flourish . wootz steel originated in south india in the 3rd century bc and was exported to foreign countries . various parts of india were ruled by numerous dynasties for the next 1,500 years , among which the gupta empire stands out . this period , witnessing a hindu religious and intellectual resurgence , is known as the classical or " golden age of india . " during this period , aspects of indian civilization , administration , culture , and religion ( hinduism and buddhism ) spread to much of asia , while kingdoms in southern india had maritime business links with the roman empire from around 77 ce . indian cultural influence spread over many parts of southeast asia which led to the establishment of indianized kingdoms in southeast asia ( greater india ) .
during the september 11 , 2001 attacks on the world trade center , fbi agent leonard w. hatton jr. was killed during the rescue effort while helping the rescue personnel evacuate the occupants of the south tower and stayed when it collapsed . within months after the attacks , fbi director robert mueller , who had been sworn in a week before the attacks , called for a re-engineering of fbi structure and operations . he made countering every federal crime a top priority , including the prevention of terrorism , countering foreign intelligence operations , addressing cyber security threats , other high-tech crimes , protecting civil rights , combating public corruption , organized crime , white-collar crime , and major acts of violent crime .
the fbi frequently investigated martin luther king , jr . in the mid-1960s , king began publicly criticizing the bureau for giving insufficient attention to the use of terrorism by white supremacists . hoover responded by publicly calling king the most " notorious liar " in the united states . in his 1991 memoir , washington post journalist carl rowan asserted that the fbi had sent at least one anonymous letter to king encouraging him to commit suicide . historian taylor branch documents an anonymous november 1964 " suicide package " sent by the bureau that combined a letter to the civil rights leader telling him " you are done . there is only one way out for you ... " with audio recordings of king 's sexual indiscretions .
the fujiwara rulers failed to maintain adequate police forces , which left robbers free to prey on travelers . this is implicitly illustrated in novels by the terror that night travel inspired in the main characters . the shoen system enabled the accumulation of wealth by an aristocratic elite ; the economic surplus can be linked to the cultural developments of the heian period and the " pursuit of arts . " the major buddhist temples in heian-kyo and nara also made use of the shoen . the establishment of branches rurally and integration of some shinto shrines within these temple networks reflects a greater " organizational dynamism . "
in japanese , they are usually referred to as bushi ( 武士 ? , [ bu.ɕi ] ) or buke ( 武家 ? ) . according to translator william scott wilson : " in chinese , the character 侍 was originally a verb meaning " to wait upon " or " accompany persons " in the upper ranks of society , and this is also true of the original term in japanese , saburau . in both countries the terms were nominalized to mean " those who serve in close attendance to the nobility , " the pronunciation in japanese changing to saburai . according to wilson , an early reference to the word " samurai " appears in the kokin wakashu ( 905-914 ) , the first imperial anthology of poems , completed in the first part of the 10th century .
when war broke out between france and its rivals , russian and austrian forces invaded switzerland . the swiss refused to fight alongside the french in the name of the helvetic republic . in 1803 napoleon organised a meeting of the leading swiss politicians from both sides in paris . the result was the act of mediation which largely restored swiss autonomy and introduced a confederation of 19 cantons . henceforth , much of swiss politics would concern balancing the cantons ' tradition of self-rule with the need for a central government .
orontid armenia formally passed to empire of alexander the great following his conquest of persia . alexander appointed an orontid named mithranes to govern armenia . armenia later became a vassal state of the seleucid empire , but it maintained a considerable degree of autonomy , retaining its native rulers . towards the end 212 bc the country was divided into two kingdoms , greater armenia and armenia sophene including commagene or armenia minor . the kingdoms became so independent from seleucid control that antiochus iii the great waged war on them during his reign and replaced their rulers .
about that time the " executionist movement " ( polish : " egzekucja praw " -- " execution of the laws " ) began to take form . its members would seek to curb the power of the magnates at the sejm and to strengthen the power of king and country . in 1562 at the sejm in piotrkow they would force the magnates to return many leased crown lands to the king , and the king to create a standing army ( wojsko kwarciane ) . one of the most famous members of this movement was jan zamoyski . after his death in 1605 , the movement lost its political force .
in modern times , the name " cardinal priest " is interpreted as meaning a cardinal who is of the order of priests . originally , however , this referred to certain key priests of important churches of the diocese of rome , who were recognized as the cardinal priests , the important priests chosen by the pope to advise him in his duties as bishop of rome ( the latin cardo means " hinge " ) . certain clerics in many dioceses at the time , not just that of rome , were said to be the key personnel - the term gradually became exclusive to rome to indicate those entrusted with electing the bishop of rome , the pope .
genome size is the total number of dna base pairs in one copy of a haploid genome . the genome size is positively correlated with the morphological complexity among prokaryotes and lower eukaryotes ; however , after mollusks and all the other higher eukaryotes above , this correlation is no longer effective . this phenomenon also indicates the mighty influence coming from repetitive dna act on the genomes .
the most extreme forms of cubism were not those practiced by picasso and braque , who resisted total abstraction . other cubists , by contrast , especially frantisek kupka , and those considered orphists by apollinaire ( delaunay , leger , picabia and duchamp ) , accepted abstraction by removing visible subject matter entirely . kupka 's two entries at the 1912 salon d 'automne , amorpha-fugue a deux couleurs and amorpha chromatique chaude , were highly abstract ( or nonrepresentational ) and metaphysical in orientation . both duchamp in 1912 and picabia from 1912 to 1914 developed an expressive and allusive abstraction dedicated to complex emotional and sexual themes . beginning in 1912 delaunay painted a series of paintings entitled simultaneous windows , followed by a series entitled formes circulaires , in which he combined planar structures with bright prismatic hues ; based on the optical characteristics of juxtaposed colors his departure from reality in the depiction of imagery was quasi-complete . in 1913-14 leger produced a series entitled contrasts of forms , giving a similar stress to color , line and form . his cubism , despite its abstract qualities , was associated with themes of mechanization and modern life . apollinaire supported these early developments of abstract cubism in les peintres cubistes ( 1913 ) , writing of a new " pure " painting in which the subject was vacated . but in spite of his use of the term orphism these works were so different that they defy attempts to place them in a single category .
nutritional anthropology is a synthetic concept that deals with the interplay between economic systems , nutritional status and food security , and how changes in the former affect the latter . if economic and environmental changes in a community affect access to food , food security , and dietary health , then this interplay between culture and biology is in turn connected to broader historical and economic trends associated with globalization . nutritional status affects overall health status , work performance potential , and the overall potential for economic development ( either in terms of human development or traditional western models ) for any given group of people .
the administration of justice was of particular importance to john . several new processes had been introduced to english law under henry ii , including novel disseisin and mort d 'ancestor . these processes meant the royal courts had a more significant role in local law cases , which had previously been dealt with only by regional or local lords . john increased the professionalism of local sergeants and bailiffs , and extended the system of coroners first introduced by hubert walter in 1194 , creating a new class of borough coroners . john worked extremely hard to ensure that this system operated well , through judges he had appointed , by fostering legal specialists and expertise , and by intervening in cases himself . john continued to try relatively minor cases , even during military crises . viewed positively , lewis warren considers that john discharged " his royal duty of providing justice ... with a zeal and a tirelessness to which the english common law is greatly endebted . " seen more critically , john may have been motivated by the potential of the royal legal process to raise fees , rather than a desire to deliver simple justice ; john 's legal system also only applied to free men , rather than to all of the population . nonetheless , these changes were popular with many free tenants , who acquired a more reliable legal system that could bypass the barons , against whom such cases were often brought . john 's reforms were less popular with the barons themselves , especially as they remained subject to arbitrary and frequently vindictive royal justice .
british colonial rule introduced western elements of culture to burma . burma 's education system is modelled after that of the united kingdom . colonial architectural influences are most evident in major cities such as yangon . many ethnic minorities , particularly the karen in the southeast and the kachin and chin who populate the north and northeast , practice christianity . according to the the world factbook , the burman population is 68 % and the ethnic groups constitute 32 % . however , the exiled leaders and organisations claims that ethnic population is 40 % , which is implicitly contrasted with cia report ( official us report ) .
puerto rico 's constitution expressly forbids capital punishment , stating " the death penalty shall not exist , " setting it apart from all u.s. states and territories other than michigan , which also has a constitutional prohibition ( eleven other states and the district of columbia have abolished capital punishment through statutory law ) . however , capital punishment is still applicable to offenses committed in puerto rico , if they fall under the jurisdiction of the federal government , though federal death penalty prosecutions there have generated significant controversy .
the style and role of any minority leader is influenced by a variety of elements , including personality and contextual factors , such as the size and cohesion of the minority party , whether his or her party controls the white house , the general political climate in the house , and the controversy that is sometimes associated with the legislative agenda . despite the variability of these factors , there are a number of institutional obligations associated with this position . many of these assignments or roles are spelled out in the house rule book . others have devolved upon the position in other ways . to be sure , the minority leader is provided with extra staff resources - beyond those accorded him or her as a representative - to assist in carrying out diverse leadership functions . worth emphasis is that there are limits on the institutional role of the minority leader , because the majority party exercises disproportionate influence over the agenda , partisan ratios on committees , staff resources , administrative operations , and the day-to-day schedule and management of floor activities .
the new haven green is the site of many free music concerts , especially during the summer months . these have included the new haven symphony orchestra , the july free concerts on the green in july , and the new haven jazz festival in august . the jazz festival , which began in 1982 , is one of the longest-running free outdoor festivals in the u.s. , until it was canceled for 2007 . headliners such as the breakfast , dave brubeck , ray charles and celia cruz have historically drawn 30,000 to 50,000 fans , filling up the new haven green to capacity . the new haven jazz festival was revived in 2008 and has been sponsored since by jazz haven .
as the laws were formulated in england , and were initially administered solely by the four british football associations within ifab , the standard dimensions of a football pitch were originally expressed in imperial units . the laws now express dimensions with approximate metric equivalents ( followed by traditional units in brackets ) , though use of imperial units remains popular in english-speaking countries with a relatively recent history of metrication ( or only partial metrication ) , such as britain .
mozart 's requiem was sung at the funeral ; the soloists were the soprano jeanne-anais castellan , the mezzo-soprano pauline viardot , the tenor alexis dupont , and the bass luigi lablache ; chopin 's preludes no. 4 in e minor and no. 6 in b minor were also played . the organist at the funeral was louis lefebure-wely . the funeral procession to pere lachaise cemetery , which included chopin 's sister ludwika , was led by the aged prince adam czartoryski . the pallbearers included delacroix , franchomme , and camille pleyel . at the graveside , the funeral march from chopin 's piano sonata no. 2 was played , in reber 's instrumentation .
modern orthodoxy , as a stream of orthodox judaism represented by institutions such as the u.s. national council for young israel , is pro-zionist and thus places a high national , as well as religious , significance on the state of israel , and its affiliates are , typically , zionist in orientation . it also practices involvement with non-orthodox jews that extends beyond " outreach ( kiruv ) " to continued institutional relations and cooperation ; see further under torah umadda . other " core beliefs " are a recognition of the value and importance of secular studies , a commitment to equality of education for both men and women , and a full acceptance of the importance of being able to financially support oneself and one 's family .
the final chapter reviews points from earlier chapters , and darwin concludes by hoping that his theory might produce revolutionary changes in many fields of natural history . although he avoids the controversial topic of human origins in the rest of the book so as not to prejudice readers against his theory , here he ventures a cautious hint that psychology would be put on a new foundation and that " light will be thrown on the origin of man . " darwin ends with a passage that became well known and much quoted :
the negritos are believed to be the first inhabitants of southeast asia . once inhabiting taiwan , vietnam , and various other parts of asia , they are now confined primarily to thailand , the malay archipelago , and the andaman and nicobar islands . negrito means " little black people " in spanish ( negrito is the spanish diminutive of negro , i.e. , " little black person " ) ; it is what the spaniards called the short-statured , hunter-gatherer autochthones that they encountered in the philippines . despite this , negritos are never referred to as black today , and doing so would cause offense . the term negrito itself has come under criticism in countries like malaysia , where it is now interchangeable with the more acceptable semang , although this term actually refers to a specific group . the common thai word for negritos literally means " frizzy hair . "
in species which show a distinct difference between heartwood and sapwood the natural color of heartwood is usually darker than that of the sapwood , and very frequently the contrast is conspicuous ( see section of yew log above ) . this is produced by deposits in the heartwood of chemical substances , so that a dramatic color difference does not mean a dramatic difference in the mechanical properties of heartwood and sapwood , although there may be a dramatic chemical difference .
pope paul vi became the first pope to visit six continents , and was the most travelled pope in history to that time , earning the nickname " the pilgrim pope . " with his travels he opened new avenues for the papacy , which were continued by his successors john paul ii and benedict xvi . he travelled to the holy land in 1964 , to the eucharistic congresses in bombay , india and bogota , colombia . in 1966 , however , he was twice denied permission to visit poland for the 1,000th anniversary of the baptism of poland . in 1967 , however , fifty years after the first apparition , he visited fatima in portugal . he undertook a pastoral visit to africa in 1969 . on 27 november 1970 he was the target of an assassination attempt at manila international airport in the philippines . he was only lightly stabbed by the would-be assassin benjamin mendoza y amor flores , who was subdued by the pope 's personal bodyguard and trip organizer , msgr. paul marcinkus .
gaddafi 's earliest education was of a religious nature , imparted by a local islamic teacher . subsequently moving to nearby sirte to attend elementary school , he progressed through six grades in four years . education in libya was not free , but his father thought it would greatly benefit his son despite the financial strain . during the week gaddafi slept in a mosque , and at weekends walked 20 miles to visit his parents . bullied for being a bedouin , he was proud of his identity and encouraged pride in other bedouin children . from sirte , he and his family moved to the market town of sabha in fezzan , south-central libya , where his father worked as a caretaker for a tribal leader while muammar attended secondary school , something neither parent had done . gaddafi was popular at school ; some friends made there received significant jobs in his later administration , most notably his best friend abdul salam jalloud .
originally known as buckingham house , the building at the core of today 's palace was a large townhouse built for the duke of buckingham in 1703 on a site that had been in private ownership for at least 150 years . it was acquired by king george iii in 1761 as a private residence for queen charlotte and became known as " the queen 's house . " during the 19th century it was enlarged , principally by architects john nash and edward blore , who constructed three wings around a central courtyard . buckingham palace became the london residence of the british monarch on the accession of queen victoria in 1837 .
liquor was another profitable private industry nationalized by the central government in 98 bc . however , this was repealed in 81 bc and a property tax rate of two coins for every 0.2 l ( 0.05 gallons ) was levied for those who traded it privately . by 110 bc emperor wu also interfered with the profitable trade in grain when he eliminated speculation by selling government-stored grain at a lower price than demanded by merchants . apart from emperor ming 's creation of a short-lived office for price adjustment and stabilization , which was abolished in 68 ad , central-government price control regulations were largely absent during the eastern han .
after being lit at the birthplace of the olympic games in olympia , greece on march 24 , the torch traveled to the panathinaiko stadium in athens , and then to beijing , arriving on march 31 . from beijing , the torch was following a route passing through six continents . the torch has visited cities along the silk road , symbolizing ancient links between china and the rest of the world . the relay also included an ascent with the flame to the top of mount everest on the border of nepal and tibet , china from the chinese side , which was closed specially for the event .
new york city has a high degree of income disparity as indicated by its gini coefficient of 0.5 for the city overall and 0.6 for manhattan . the disparity is driven by wage growth in high-income brackets , while wages have stagnated for middle and lower-income brackets . in the first quarter of 2014 , the average weekly wage in new york county ( manhattan ) was $ 2,749 , representing the highest total among large counties in the united states . in 2013 , new york city had the highest number of billionaires of any city in the world , higher than the next five u.s. cities combined , including former mayor michael r. bloomberg . new york also had the highest density of millionaires per capita among major u.s. cities in 2014 , at 4.6 % of residents . lower manhattan has been experiencing a baby boom , with the area south of canal street witnessing 1,086 births in 2010 , 12 % greater than 2009 and over twice the number born in 2001 .
the southern side of miami includes coral way , the roads and coconut grove . coral way is a historic residential neighborhood built in 1922 connecting downtown with coral gables , and is home to many old homes and tree-lined streets . coconut grove was established in 1825 and is the location of miami 's city hall in dinner key , the coconut grove playhouse , cocowalk , many nightclubs , bars , restaurants and bohemian shops , and as such , is very popular with local college students . it is a historic neighborhood with narrow , winding roads , and a heavy tree canopy . coconut grove has many parks and gardens such as villa vizcaya , the kampong , the barnacle historic state park , and is the home of the coconut grove convention center and numerous historic homes and estates .
as with bacterial classification , identification of bacteria is increasingly using molecular methods . diagnostics using dna-based tools , such as polymerase chain reaction , are increasingly popular due to their specificity and speed , compared to culture-based methods . these methods also allow the detection and identification of " viable but nonculturable " cells that are metabolically active but non-dividing . however , even using these improved methods , the total number of bacterial species is not known and cannot even be estimated with any certainty . following present classification , there are a little less than 9,300 known species of prokaryotes , which includes bacteria and archaea ; but attempts to estimate the true number of bacterial diversity have ranged from 107 to 109 total species - and even these diverse estimates may be off by many orders of magnitude .
the war was successful for great britain , which gained the bulk of new france in north america , spanish florida , some individual caribbean islands in the west indies , the colony of senegal on the west african coast , and superiority over the french trading outposts on the indian subcontinent . the native american tribes were excluded from the settlement ; a subsequent conflict , known as pontiac 's war , was also unsuccessful in returning them to their pre-war status . in europe , the war began disastrously for prussia , but a combination of good luck and successful strategy saw king frederick the great manage to retrieve the prussian position and retain the status quo ante bellum . prussia emerged as a new european great power . the involvement of portugal , spain and sweden did not return them to their former status as great powers . france was deprived of many of its colonies and had saddled itself with heavy war debts that its inefficient financial system could barely handle . spain lost florida but gained french louisiana and regained control of its colonies , e.g. , cuba and the philippines , which had been captured by the british during the war . france and other european powers will soon avenge their defeat in 1778 when american revolutionary war broke out , with hopes of destroying britain 's dominance once and for all .
western catalan comprises the two dialects of northwestern catalan and valencian ; the eastern block comprises four dialects : central catalan , balearic , rossellonese , and alguerese . each dialect can be further subdivided in several subdialects .
basically , race in brazil was " biologized , " but in a way that recognized the difference between ancestry ( which determines genotype ) and phenotypic differences . there , racial identity was not governed by rigid descent rule , such as the one-drop rule , as it was in the united states . a brazilian child was never automatically identified with the racial type of one or both parents , nor were there only a very limited number of categories to choose from , to the extent that full siblings can pertain to different racial groups .
the bronx / ˈbrɒŋks / is the northernmost of the five boroughs ( counties ) of new york city in the state of new york , located south of westchester county . many bridges and tunnels link the bronx to the island and borough of manhattan to the west over and under the narrow harlem river , as well as three longer bridges south over the east river to the borough of queens . of the five boroughs , the bronx is the only one on the u.s. mainland and , with a land area of 42 square miles ( 109 km2 ) and a population of 1,438,159 in 2014 , has the fourth largest land area , the fourth highest population , and the third-highest population density .
religious ashkenazi jews living in israel are obliged to follow the authority of the chief ashkenazi rabbi in halakhic matters . in this respect , a religiously ashkenazi jew is an israeli who is more likely to support certain religious interests in israel , including certain political parties . these political parties result from the fact that a portion of the israeli electorate votes for jewish religious parties ; although the electoral map changes from one election to another , there are generally several small parties associated with the interests of religious ashkenazi jews . the role of religious parties , including small religious parties that play important roles as coalition members , results in turn from israel 's composition as a complex society in which competing social , economic , and religious interests stand for election to the knesset , a unicameral legislature with 120 seats .
ann arbor was founded in 1824 , named for wives of the village 's founders and the stands of bur oak trees . the university of michigan moved from detroit to ann arbor in 1837 , and the city grew at a rapid rate in the early to mid-20th century . during the 1960s and 1970s , the city gained a reputation as a center for left-wing politics . ann arbor became a focal point for political activism and served as a hub for the civil-rights movement and anti-vietnam war movement , as well as various student movements .

the city of kathmandu is named after kasthamandap temple , that stood in durbar square . in sanskrit , kastha ( काष  ठ ) means " wood " and mandap ( / मण  डप ) means " covered shelter . " this temple , also known as maru satal in the newar language , was built in 1596 by king laxmi narsingh malla . the two-storey structure was made entirely of wood , and used no iron nails nor supports . according to legend , all the timber used to build the pagoda was obtained from a single tree . the structure collapsed during the major earthquake on 25 april 2015 .

by 1975 the majority of local authorities in england and wales had abandoned the 11-plus examination and moved to a comprehensive system . over that 10-year period many secondary modern schools and grammar schools were amalgamated to form large neighbourhood comprehensives , whilst a number of new schools were built to accommodate a growing school population . by the mid-1970s the system had been almost fully implemented , with virtually no secondary modern schools remaining . many grammar schools were either closed or changed to comprehensive status . some local authorities , including sandwell and dudley in the west midlands , changed all of its state secondary schools to comprehensive schools during the 1970s .
the cottonseed which remains after the cotton is ginned is used to produce cottonseed oil , which , after refining , can be consumed by humans like any other vegetable oil . the cottonseed meal that is left generally is fed to ruminant livestock ; the gossypol remaining in the meal is toxic to monogastric animals . cottonseed hulls can be added to dairy cattle rations for roughage . during the american slavery period , cotton root bark was used in folk remedies as an abortifacient , that is , to induce a miscarriage . gossypol was one of the many substances found in all parts of the cotton plant and it was described by the scientists as ' poisonous pigment ' . it also appears to inhibit the development of sperm or even restrict the mobility of the sperm . also , it is thought to interfere with the menstrual cycle by restricting the release of certain hormones .
the period known as the crusades , a series of religiously motivated military expeditions originally intended to bring the levant back into christian rule , began . several crusader states were founded in the eastern mediterranean . these were all short-lived . the crusaders would have a profound impact on many parts of europe . their sack of constantinople in 1204 brought an abrupt end to the byzantine empire . though it would later be re-established , it would never recover its former glory . the crusaders would establish trade routes that would develop into the silk road and open the way for the merchant republics of genoa and venice to become major economic powers . the reconquista , a related movement , worked to reconquer iberia for christendom .
the practice of using dogs and other animals as a part of therapy dates back to the late 18th century , when animals were introduced into mental institutions to help socialize patients with mental disorders . animal-assisted intervention research has shown that animal-assisted therapy with a dog can increase social behaviors , such as smiling and laughing , among people with alzheimer 's disease . one study demonstrated that children with adhd and conduct disorders who participated in an education program with dogs and other animals showed increased attendance , increased knowledge and skill objectives , and decreased antisocial and violent behavior compared to those who were not in an animal-assisted program .
the allies had had time to consider the problem . the french being brought around to agree that the key to the defence was the malakoff . : 441 emphasis of the siege at sevastopol shifted to the british left , against the fortifications on malakoff hill . : 339 in march , there was fighting by the french over a new fort being built by the russians at mamelon , located on a hill in front of the malakoff . several weeks of fighting saw little change in the front line , and the mamelon remained in russian hands .

in 1911 arsphenamine , the first synthetic anti-infective drug , was developed by paul ehrlich and chemist alfred bertheim of the institute of experimental therapy in berlin . the drug was given the commercial name salvarsan . ehrlich , noting both the general toxicity of arsenic and the selective absorption of certain dyes by bacteria , hypothesized that an arsenic-containing dye with similar selective absorption properties could be used to treat bacterial infections . arsphenamine was prepared as part of a campaign to synthesize a series of such compounds , and found to exhibit partially selective toxicity . arsphenamine proved to be the first effective treatment for syphilis , a disease which prior to that time was incurable and led inexorably to severe skin ulceration , neurological damage , and death .

the swazi economy is very closely linked to the economy of south africa , from which it receives over 90 % of its imports and to which it sends about 70 % of its exports . swaziland 's other key trading partners are the united states and the eu , from whom the country has received trade preferences for apparel exports ( under the african growth and opportunity act - agoa - to the us ) and for sugar ( to the eu ) . under these agreements , both apparel and sugar exports did well , with rapid growth and a strong inflow of foreign direct investment . textile exports grew by over 200 % between 2000 and 2005 and sugar exports increasing by more than 50 % over the same period .
the university of the republic is the country 's largest and most important university , with a student body of 81,774 , according to the census of 2007 . it was founded on 18 july 1849 in montevideo , where most of its buildings and facilities are still located . its current rector is dr. rodrigo arocena . the university houses 14 faculties ( departments ) and various institutes and schools . many eminent uruguayans have graduated from this university , including carlos vaz ferreira , jose luis massera , gabriel paternain , mario wschebor , roman fresnedo siri , carlos ott and eladio dieste
the loss of such a large portion of british america , at the time britain 's most populous overseas possession , is seen by some historians as the event defining the transition between the " first " and " second " empires , in which britain shifted its attention away from the americas to asia , the pacific and later africa . adam smith 's wealth of nations , published in 1776 , had argued that colonies were redundant , and that free trade should replace the old mercantilist policies that had characterised the first period of colonial expansion , dating back to the protectionism of spain and portugal . the growth of trade between the newly independent united states and britain after 1783 seemed to confirm smith 's view that political control was not necessary for economic success .
when learning how to write hanja , students are taught to memorize the native korean pronunciation for the hanja 's meaning and the sino-korean pronunciations ( the pronunciation based on the chinese pronunciation of the characters ) for each hanja respectively so that students know what the syllable and meaning is for a particular hanja . for example , the name for the hanja 水 is 물 수 ( mul-su ) in which 물 ( mul ) is the native korean pronunciation for " water , " while 수 ( su ) is the sino-korean pronunciation of the character . the naming of hanja is similar to if " water " were named " water-aqua , " " horse-equus , " or " gold-aurum " based on a hybridization of both the english and the latin names . other examples include 사람 인 ( saram-in ) for 人 " person / people , " 큰 대 ( keun-dae ) for 大 " big / large / / great , " 작을 소 ( jakeul-so ) for 小 " small / little , " 아래 하 ( arae-ha ) for 下 " underneath / below / low , " 아비 부 ( abi-bu ) for 父 " father , " and 나라이름 한 ( naraimreum-han ) for 韓 " han / korea .

to raise money , seagram head edgar bronfman jr. sold universal 's television holdings , including cable network usa , to barry diller ( these same properties would be bought back later at greatly inflated prices ) . in june 2000 , seagram was sold to french water utility and media company vivendi , which owned studiocanal ; the conglomerate then became known as vivendi universal . afterward , universal pictures acquired the united states distribution rights of several of studiocanal 's films , such as mulholland drive ( which received an oscar nomination ) and brotherhood of the wolf ( which became the second-highest-grossing french-language film in the united states since 1980 ) . universal pictures and studiocanal also co-produced several films , such as love actually ( an $ 40 million-budgeted film that eventually grossed $ 246 million worldwide ) . in late 2000 , the new york film academy was permitted to use the universal studios backlot for student film projects in an unofficial partnership .
hunting-gathering was the common human mode of subsistence throughout the paleolithic , but the observation of current-day hunters and gatherers does not necessarily reflect paleolithic societies ; the hunter-gatherer cultures examined today have had much contact with modern civilization and do not represent " pristine " conditions found in uncontacted peoples .
in the classical music domain , portugal is represented by names as the pianists artur pizarro , maria joao pires , sequeira costa , the violinists carlos damas , gerardo ribeiro and in the past by the great cellist guilhermina suggia . notable composers include jose vianna da motta , carlos seixas , joao domingos bomtempo , joao de sousa carvalho , luis de freitas branco and his student joly braga santos , fernando lopes-graca , emmanuel nunes and sergio azevedo . similarly , contemporary composers such as nuno malo and miguel d 'oliveira have achieved some international success writing original music for film and television .
in 1913 the zliten mosaic , a roman mosaic famous for its many scenes from gladiatorial contests , hunting and everyday life , was discovered in the libyan town of zliten . in 2000 archaeologists working in leptis magna , libya , uncovered a 30 ft length of five colorful mosaics created during the 1st or 2nd century ad . the mosaics show a warrior in combat with a deer , four young men wrestling a wild bull to the ground , and a gladiator resting in a state of fatigue , staring at his slain opponent . the mosaics decorated the walls of a cold plunge pool in a bath house within a roman villa . the gladiator mosaic is noted by scholars as one of the finest examples of mosaic art ever seen - a " masterpiece comparable in quality with the alexander mosaic in pompeii . "
modern electrification systems take ac energy from a power grid which is delivered to a locomotive and converted to a dc voltage to be used by traction motors . these motors may either be dc motors which directly use the dc or they may be 3-phase ac motors which require further conversion of the dc to 3-phase ac ( using power electronics ) . thus both systems are faced with the same task : converting and transporting high-voltage ac from the power grid to low-voltage dc in the locomotive . where should this conversion take place and at what voltage and current ( ac or dc ) should the power flow to the locomotive ? and how does all this relate to energy-efficiency ? both the transmission and conversion of electric energy involve losses : ohmic losses in wires and power electronics , magnetic field losses in transformers and smoothing reactors ( inductors ) . power conversion for a dc system takes place mainly in a railway substation where large , heavy , and more efficient hardware can be used as compared to an ac system where conversion takes place aboard the locomotive where space is limited and losses are significantly higher . also , the energy used to blow air to cool transformers , power electronics ( including rectifiers ) , and other conversion hardware must be accounted for .
regarding the classical music , it was through the ionian islands ( which were under western rule and influence ) that all the major advances of the western european classical music were introduced to mainland greeks . the region is notable for the birth of the first school of modern greek classical music ( heptanesean or ionian school , greek : επτανησιακη σχολη ) , established in 1815 . prominent representatives of this genre include nikolaos mantzaros , spyridon xyndas , spyridon samaras and pavlos carrer . manolis kalomiris is considered the founder of the greek national school of music .
in 1984 , he was appointed as a member of the order of the companions of honour ( ch ) by queen elizabeth ii of the united kingdom on the advice of the british prime minister margaret thatcher for his " services to the study of economics . " hayek had hoped to receive a baronetcy , and after he was awarded the ch he sent a letter to his friends requesting that he be called the english version of friedrich ( frederick ) from now on . after his 20 min audience with the queen , he was " absolutely besotted " with her according to his daughter-in-law , esca hayek . hayek said a year later that he was " amazed by her . that ease and skill , as if she 'd known me all my life . " the audience with the queen was followed by a dinner with family and friends at the institute of economic affairs . when , later that evening , hayek was dropped off at the reform club , he commented : " i 've just had the happiest day of my life . "
perhaps the most prominent , controversial and far-reaching theory in all of science has been the theory of evolution by natural selection put forward by the british naturalist charles darwin in his book on the origin of species in 1859 . darwin proposed that the features of all living things , including humans , were shaped by natural processes over long periods of time . the theory of evolution in its current form affects almost all areas of biology . implications of evolution on fields outside of pure science have led to both opposition and support from different parts of society , and profoundly influenced the popular understanding of " man 's place in the universe . " in the early 20th century , the study of heredity became a major investigation after the rediscovery in 1900 of the laws of inheritance developed by the moravian monk gregor mendel in 1866 . mendel 's laws provided the beginnings of the study of genetics , which became a major field of research for both scientific and industrial research . by 1953 , james d. watson , francis crick and maurice wilkins clarified the basic structure of dna , the genetic material for expressing life in all its forms . in the late 20th century , the possibilities of genetic engineering became practical for the first time , and a massive international effort began in 1990 to map out an entire human genome ( the human genome project ) .
the word gumbe is sometimes used generically , to refer to any music of the country , although it most specifically refers to a unique style that fuses about ten of the country 's folk music traditions . tina and tinga are other popular genres , while extent folk traditions include ceremonial music used in funerals , initiations and other rituals , as well as balanta brosca and kussunde , mandinga djambadon , and the kundere sound of the bissagos islands .
the internal unrest reached its most serious state , however , in the two civil wars that were caused by the clash between generals gaius marius and lucius cornelius sulla starting from 88 bc . in the battle of the colline gate at the very door of the city of rome , a roman army under sulla bested an army of the marius supporters and entered the city . sulla 's actions marked a watershed in the willingness of roman troops to wage war against one another that was to pave the way for the wars which ultimately overthrew the republic , and caused the founding of the roman empire .
the basic annelid form consists of multiple segments . each segment has the same sets of organs and , in most polychaetes , has a pair of parapodia that many species use for locomotion . septa separate the segments of many species , but are poorly defined or absent in others , and echiura and sipuncula show no obvious signs of segmentation . in species with well-developed septa , the blood circulates entirely within blood vessels , and the vessels in segments near the front ends of these species are often built up with muscles that act as hearts . the septa of such species also enable them to change the shapes of individual segments , which facilitates movement by peristalsis ( " ripples " that pass along the body ) or by undulations that improve the effectiveness of the parapodia . in species with incomplete septa or none , the blood circulates through the main body cavity without any kind of pump , and there is a wide range of locomotory techniques - some burrowing species turn their pharynges inside out to drag themselves through the sediment .
detroit is cited as the birthplace of techno music in the early 1980s . the city also lends its name to an early and pioneering genre of electronic dance music , " detroit techno . " featuring science fiction imagery and robotic themes , its futuristic style was greatly influenced by the geography of detroit 's urban decline and its industrial past . prominent detroit techno artists include juan atkins , derrick may , and kevin saunderson . the detroit electronic music festival , now known as " movement , " occurs annually in late may on memorial day weekend , and takes place in hart plaza . in the early years ( 2000-2002 ) , this was a landmark event , boasting over a million estimated attendees annually , coming from all over the world to celebrate techno music in the city of its birth .
the roman empire reached its greatest territorial extent during the 2nd century ad ; the following two centuries witnessed the slow decline of roman control over its outlying territories . economic issues , including inflation , and external pressure on the frontiers combined to make the 3rd century politically unstable , with emperors coming to the throne only to be rapidly replaced by new usurpers . military expenses increased steadily during the 3rd century , mainly in response to the war with sassanid persia , which revived in the middle of the 3rd century . the army doubled in size , and cavalry and smaller units replaced the legion as the main tactical unit . the need for revenue led to increased taxes and a decline in numbers of the curial , or landowning , class , and decreasing numbers of them willing to shoulder the burdens of holding office in their native towns . more bureaucrats were needed in the central administration to deal with the needs of the army , which led to complaints from civilians that there were more tax-collectors in the empire than tax-payers .
the brief success of the communists also fed into the hands of the british union of fascists ( buf ) . anti-semitic attitudes became widespread , particularly in london . rumours that jewish support was underpinning the communist surge were frequent . rumours that jews were inflating prices , were responsible for the black market , were the first to panic under attack ( even the cause of the panic ) , and secured the best shelters via underhanded methods , were also widespread . moreover , there was also racial antagonism between the small black , indian and jewish communities . however , the feared race riots did not transpire despite the mixing of different peoples into confined areas .
menander protector mentions a daurentius ( 577-579 ) that slew an avar envoy of khagan bayan i. the avars asked the slavs to accept the suzerainty of the avars , he however declined and is reported as saying : " others do not conquer our land , we conquer theirs - so it shall always be for us . "
the city shares a 15-mile ( 24 km ) border with mexico that includes two border crossings . san diego hosts the busiest international border crossing in the world , in the san ysidro neighborhood at the san ysidro port of entry . a second , primarily commercial border crossing operates in the otay mesa area ; it is the largest commercial crossing on the california-baja california border and handles the third-highest volume of trucks and dollar value of trade among all united states-mexico land crossings .
both private individuals and large production companies have used youtube to grow audiences . independent content creators have built grassroots followings numbering in the thousands at very little cost or effort , while mass retail and radio promotion proved problematic . concurrently , old media celebrities moved into the website at the invitation of a youtube management that witnessed early content creators accruing substantial followings , and perceived audience sizes potentially larger than that attainable by television . while youtube 's revenue-sharing " partner program " made it possible to earn a substantial living as a video producer - its top five hundred partners each earning more than $ 100,000 annually and its ten highest-earning channels grossing from $ 2.5 million to $ 12 million - in 2012 cmu business editor characterized youtube as " a free-to-use ... promotional platform for the music labels . " in 2013 forbes ' katheryn thayer asserted that digital-era artists ' work must not only be of high quality , but must elicit reactions on the youtube platform and social media . in 2013 , videos of the 2.5 % of artists categorized as " mega , " " mainstream " and " mid-sized " received 90.3 % of the relevant views on youtube and vevo . by early 2013 billboard had announced that it was factoring youtube streaming data into calculation of the billboard hot 100 and related genre charts .
nigeria has also been pervaded by political corruption . it was ranked 143 out of 182 countries in transparency international 's 2011 corruption perceptions index ; however , it improved to 136th position in 2014 . more than $ 400 billion were stolen from the treasury by nigeria 's leaders between 1960 and 1999 . in late 2013 , nigeria 's then central bank governor lamido sanusi informed president goodluck jonathan that the state oil company , nnpc had failed to remit us $ 20 billion of oil revenues , which it owed the state . jonathan however dismissed the claim and replaced sanusi for his mismanagement of the central bank 's budget . a senate committee also found sanusi 's account to be lacking substance . after the conclusion of the nnpc 's account audit , it was announced in january 2015 that nnpc 's non-remitted revenue is actually us $ 1.48billion , which it needs to refund back to the government .
near-infrared is the region closest in wavelength to the radiation detectable by the human eye , mid- and far-infrared are progressively further from the visible spectrum . other definitions follow different physical mechanisms ( emission peaks , vs. bands , water absorption ) and the newest follow technical reasons ( the common silicon detectors are sensitive to about 1,050 nm , while ingaas 's sensitivity starts around 950 nm and ends between 1,700 and 2,600 nm , depending on the specific configuration ) . unfortunately , international standards for these specifications are not currently available .
with the decline of the roman empire , alsace became the territory of the germanic alemanni . the alemanni were agricultural people , and their germanic language formed the basis of modern-day dialects spoken along the upper rhine ( alsatian , alemannian , swabian , swiss ) . clovis and the franks defeated the alemanni during the 5th century ad , culminating with the battle of tolbiac , and alsace became part of the kingdom of austrasia . under clovis ' merovingian successors the inhabitants were christianized . alsace remained under frankish control until the frankish realm , following the oaths of strasbourg of 842 , was formally dissolved in 843 at the treaty of verdun ; the grandsons of charlemagne divided the realm into three parts . alsace formed part of the middle francia , which was ruled by the youngest grandson lothar i. lothar died early in 855 and his realm was divided into three parts . the part known as lotharingia , or lorraine , was given to lothar 's son . the rest was shared between lothar 's brothers charles the bald ( ruler of the west frankish realm ) and louis the german ( ruler of the east frankish realm ) . the kingdom of lotharingia was short-lived , however , becoming the stem duchy of lorraine in eastern francia after the treaty of ribemont in 880 . alsace was united with the other alemanni east of the rhine into the stem duchy of swabia .
in the early 19th century , the indigenous american woman sacagawea , who would help translate for and guide the lewis and clark expedition in the west , married the french trapper toussaint charbonneau . most marriages between europeans and indigenous americans were between european men and indigenous american women . depending on the kinship system of the woman 's tribe , their children would be more or less easily assimilated into the tribe . nations that had matrilineal systems , such as the creek and cherokee in the southeast , gave the mixed-race children status in their mother 's clans and tribes . if the tribe had a patrilineal system , like the omaha , the children of white fathers were considered white . unless they were specifically adopted into the tribe by an adult male , they could have no social status in it .
the list of nutrients that people are known to require is , in the words of marion nestle , " almost certainly incomplete . " as of 2014 , nutrients are thought to be of two types : macro-nutrients which are needed in relatively large amounts , and micronutrients which are needed in smaller quantities . a type of carbohydrate , dietary fiber , i.e. non-digestible material such as cellulose , is required , for both mechanical and biochemical reasons , although the exact reasons remain unclear . other micronutrients include antioxidants and phytochemicals , which are said to influence ( or protect ) some body systems . their necessity is not as well established as in the case of , for instance , vitamins .
according to capitol record 's a & r , joe weinberger , he was approached by west and almost signed a deal with him , but another person in the company convinced capitol 's president not to . desperate to keep west from defecting to another label , then-label head damon dash reluctantly signed west to roc-a-fella records . jay-z later admitted that roc-a-fella was initially reluctant to support west as a rapper , claiming that many saw him as a producer first and foremost , and that his background contrasted with that of his labelmates .
brigham young university 's origin can be traced back to 1862 when a man named warren dusenberry started a provo school in a prominent adobe building called cluff hall , which was located in the northeast corner of 200 east and 200 north . on october 16 , 1875 , brigham young , then president of the lds church , personally purchased the lewis building after previously hinting that a school would be built in draper , utah in 1867 . hence , october 16 , 1875 is commonly held as byu 's founding date . said young about his vision : " i hope to see an academy established in provo ... at which the children of the latter-day saints can receive a good education unmixed with the pernicious atheistic influences that are found in so many of the higher schools of the country . "
the end of world war ii set the stage for the east-west confrontation known as the cold war . with the outbreak of the korean war , concerns over the defense of western europe rose . two corps , v and vii , were reactivated under seventh united states army in 1950 and american strength in europe rose from one division to four . hundreds of thousands of u.s. troops remained stationed in west germany , with others in belgium , the netherlands and the united kingdom , until the 1990s in anticipation of a possible soviet attack .
caesar held both the dictatorship and the tribunate , and alternated between the consulship and the proconsulship . in 48 bc , caesar was given permanent tribunician powers . this made his person sacrosanct , gave him the power to veto the senate , and allowed him to dominate the plebeian council . in 46 bc , caesar was given censorial powers , which he used to fill the senate with his own partisans . caesar then raised the membership of the senate to 900 . this robbed the senatorial aristocracy of its prestige , and made it increasingly subservient to him . while the assemblies continued to meet , he submitted all candidates to the assemblies for election , and all bills to the assemblies for enactment . thus , the assemblies became powerless and were unable to oppose him .
in the simplest case , a single connection is established to an upstream isp and is used to transmit data to or from areas of the internet beyond the home network ; this mode of interconnection is often cascaded multiple times until reaching a tier 1 carrier . in reality , the situation is often more complex . isps with more than one point of presence ( pop ) may have separate connections to an upstream isp at multiple pops , or they may be customers of multiple upstream isps and may have connections to each one of them at one or more point of presence . transit isps provide large amounts of bandwidth for connecting hosting isps and access isps .
the earthquake was the worst to strike the sichuan area in over 30 years . following the quake , experts and the general public sought information on whether or not the earthquake could have been predicted in advance , and whether or not studying statistics related to the quake could result in better prediction of earthquakes in the future . earthquake prediction is not yet established science ; there was no consensus within the scientific community that earthquake " prediction " is possible .
the area 's many colleges and universities are active in college athletics . four ncaa division i members play in the city - boston college , boston university , harvard university , and northeastern university . of the four , only boston college participates in college football at the highest level , the football bowl subdivision . harvard participates in the second-highest level , the football championship subdivision .
the timing of puberty can have important psychological and social consequences . early maturing boys are usually taller and stronger than their friends . they have the advantage in capturing the attention of potential partners and in becoming hand-picked for sports . pubescent boys often tend to have a good body image , are more confident , secure , and more independent . late maturing boys can be less confident because of poor body image when comparing themselves to already developed friends and peers . however , early puberty is not always positive for boys ; early sexual maturation in boys can be accompanied by increased aggressiveness due to the surge of hormones that affect them . because they appear older than their peers , pubescent boys may face increased social pressure to conform to adult norms ; society may view them as more emotionally advanced , despite the fact that their cognitive and social development may lag behind their appearance . studies have shown that early maturing boys are more likely to be sexually active and are more likely to participate in risky behaviors .
in april 2014 , it was announced that ge was in talks to acquire the global power division of french engineering group alstom for a figure of around $ 13 billion . a rival joint bid was submitted in june 2014 by siemens and mitsubishi heavy industries ( mhi ) with siemens seeking to acquire alstom 's gas turbine business for € 3.9 billion , and mhi proposing a joint venture in steam turbines , plus a € 3.1 billion cash investment . in june 2014 a formal offer from ge worth $ 17 billion was agreed by the alstom board . part of the transaction involved the french government taking a 20 % stake in alstom to help secure france 's energy and transport interests , and french jobs . a rival offer from siemens-mitsubishi heavy industries was rejected . the acquisition was expected to be completed in 2015 .
southampton had an estimated 236,900 people living within the city boundary in 2011 . there is a sizeable polish population in the city , with estimates as high as 20,000 .
to be considered ' enriched ' , the uranium-235 fraction should be between 3 % and 5 % . this process produces huge quantities of uranium that is depleted of uranium-235 and with a correspondingly increased fraction of uranium-238 , called depleted uranium or ' du ' . to be considered ' depleted ' , the uranium-235 isotope concentration should be no more than 0.3 % . the price of uranium has risen since 2001 , so enrichment tailings containing more than 0.35 % uranium-235 are being considered for re-enrichment , driving the price of depleted uranium hexafluoride above $ 130 per kilogram in july 2007 from $ 5 in 2001 .
portuguese is the official language of portugal . portuguese is a romance language that originated in what is now galicia and northern portugal , originating from galician-portuguese , which was the common language of the galician and portuguese people until the independence of portugal . particularly in the north of portugal , there are still many similarities between the galician culture and the portuguese culture . galicia is a consultative observer of the community of portuguese language countries . according to the ethnologue of languages , portuguese and spanish have a lexical similarity of 89 % - educated speakers of each language can communicate easily with one another .
in 2010 , 24.9 percent of households reported having children under the age of 18 living with them , 28.3 percent were married couples living together and 22.5 percent had a female householder with no husband present , 6.0 percent had a male householder with no wife present , and 43.2 percent were non-families . the city reported 34.1 percent of all households were made up of individuals while 10.5 percent had someone living alone who was 65 years of age or older . the average household size was 2.45 and the average family size was 3.20 . in 2013 , the percentage of women who gave birth in the previous 12 months who were unmarried was 56 percent . of philadelphia 's adults , 31 percent were married or lived as a couple , 55 percent were not married , 11 percent were divorced or separated , and 3 percent were widowed .

charleston is the primary medical center for the eastern portion of the state . the city has several major hospitals located in the downtown area : medical university of south carolina medical center ( musc ) , ralph h. johnson va medical center , and roper hospital . musc is the state 's first school of medicine , the largest medical university in the state , and the sixth-oldest continually operating school of medicine in the united states . the downtown medical district is experiencing rapid growth of biotechnology and medical research industries coupled with substantial expansions of all the major hospitals . additionally , more expansions are planned or underway at another major hospital located in the west ashley portion of the city : bon secours-st francis xavier hospital . the trident regional medical center located in the city of north charleston and east cooper regional medical center located in mount pleasant also serve the needs of residents of the city of charleston .
digital cameras have far surpassed film in terms of sensitivity to light , with iso equivalent speeds of up to 409,600 , a number that is unfathomable in the realm of conventional film photography . faster processors , as well as advances in software noise reduction techniques allow this type of processing to be executed the moment the photo is captured , allowing photographers to store images that have a higher level of refinement and would have been prohibitively time consuming to process with earlier generations of digital camera hardware .
in the united states , there was a movement to resettle american free blacks and freed slaves in africa . the american colonization society was founded in 1816 in washington , dc for this purpose , by a group of prominent politicians and slaveholders . but its membership grew to include mostly people who supported abolition of slavery . slaveholders wanted to get free people of color out of the south , where they were thought to threaten the stability of the slave societies . some abolitionists collaborated on relocation of free blacks , as they were discouraged by discrimination against them in the north and believed they would never be accepted in the larger society . most african americans , who were native-born by this time , wanted to improve conditions in the united states rather than emigrate . leading activists in the north strongly opposed the acs , but some free blacks were ready to try a different environment .
the alkali metal ions are small and mobile ; their presence in glass allows a degree of electrical conductivity , especially in molten state or at high temperature . their mobility decreases the chemical resistance of the glass , allowing leaching by water and facilitating corrosion . alkaline earth ions , with their two positive charges and requirement for two non-bridging oxygen ions to compensate for their charge , are much less mobile themselves and also hinder diffusion of other ions , especially the alkalis . the most common commercial glasses contain both alkali and alkaline earth ions ( usually sodium and calcium ) , for easier processing and satisfying corrosion resistance . corrosion resistance of glass can be achieved by dealkalization , removal of the alkali ions from the glass surface by reaction with e.g. sulfur or fluorine compounds . presence of alkaline metal ions has also detrimental effect to the loss tangent of the glass , and to its electrical resistance ; glasses for electronics ( sealing , vacuum tubes , lamps ... ) have to take this in account .
palermo is surrounded by mountains , formed of calcar , which form a cirque around the city . some districts of the city are divided by the mountains themselves . historically , it was relatively difficult to reach the inner part of sicily from the city because of the mounts . the tallest peak of the range is la pizzuta , about 1,333 m ( 4,373 ft . ) high . however , historically , the most important mount is monte pellegrino , which is geographically separated from the rest of the range by a plain . the mount lies right in front of the tyrrhenian sea . monte pellegrino 's cliff was described in the 19th century by johann wolfgang von goethe , as " the most beautiful promontory in the world , " in his essay " italian journey . "
during the late 19th century the jadidists established themselves as an islamic social movement throughout the region . although the jadidists were pro-modernization and not necessarily anti-russian the russians viewed the movement as a threat . [ citation needed ] russian troops were required to restore order during uprisings against the khanate of kokand between 1910 and 1913 . further violence occurred in july 1916 when demonstrators attacked russian soldiers in khujand over the threat of forced conscription during world war i. despite russian troops quickly bringing khujand back under control , clashes continued throughout the year in various locations in tajikistan .

translation is a major obstacle when comparing different cultures . many english terms lack equivalents in other languages , while concepts and words from other languages fail to be reflected in the english language . translation and vocabulary obstacles are not limited to the english language . language can force individuals to identify with a label that may or may not accurately reflect their true sexual orientation . language can also be used to signal sexual orientation to others . the meaning of words referencing categories of sexual orientation are negotiated in the mass media in relation to social organization . new words may be brought into use to describe new terms or better describe complex interpretations of sexual orientation . other words may pick up new layers or meaning . for example , the heterosexual spanish terms marido and mujer for " husband " and " wife , " respectively , have recently been replaced in spain by the gender-neutral terms conyuges or consortes meaning " spouses .

carrying a louis vuitton backpack filled with old disks and demos to the studio and back , west crafted much of his production for his debut album in less than fifteen minutes at a time . he recorded the remainder of the album in los angeles while recovering from the car accident . once he had completed the album , it was leaked months before its release date . however , west decided to use the opportunity to review the album , and the college dropout was significantly remixed , remastered , and revised before being released . as a result , certain tracks originally destined for the album were subsequently retracted , among them " keep the receipt " with ol ' dirty bastard and " the good , the bad , and the ugly " with consequence . west meticulously refined the production , adding string arrangements , gospel choirs , improved drum programming and new verses . west 's perfectionism led the college dropout to have its release postponed three times from its initial date in august 2003 .
in the general election , kerry was initially favored to defeat the republican candidate , former state representative paul w. cronin , and conservative democrat roger p. durkin , who ran as an independent . a week after the primary , one poll put kerry 26-points ahead of cronin . his campaign called for a national health insurance system , discounted prescription drugs for the unemployed , a jobs programme to clean up the merrimack river and rent controls in lowell and lawrence . a major obstacle , however , was the district 's leading newspaper , the conservative the sun . the paper editorialized against him . it also ran critical news stories about his out-of-state contributions and his " carpetbagging , " because he had only moved into the district in april . subsequently released " watergate " oval office tape recordings of the nixon white house showed that defeating kerry 's candidacy had attracted the personal attention of president nixon . kerry himself asserts that nixon sent operatives to lowell to help derail his campaign .
of the territories of poland annexed by the soviet union between 1939 and 1940 , the region around białystok and a minor part of galicia east of the san river around przemysl were returned to the polish state at the end of world war ii . of all other territories annexed by the ussr in 1939-40 , the ones detached from finland ( karelia , petsamo ) , estonia ( ingrian area and petseri county ) and latvia ( abrene ) remained part of the russian federation , the successor state of the soviet union , after 1991 . northern bukovina , southern bessarabia and hertza remain part of ukraine .
west 's outspoken views and ventures outside of music have received significant mainstream attention . he has been a frequent source of controversy and public scrutiny for his conduct at award shows , on social media , and in other public settings . his more publicized comments include his declaration that president george w. bush " doesn 't care about black people " during a live 2005 television broadcast for hurricane katrina relief , and his interruption of singer taylor swift at the 2009 mtv video music awards . west 's efforts as a designer include collaborations with nike , louis vuitton , and a.p.c. on both clothing and footwear , and have most prominently resulted in the yeezy season collaboration with adidas beginning in 2013 . he is the founder and head of the creative content company donda .
conrad gessner was the first naturalist to ascend the mountains in the 16th century , to study them , writing that in the mountains he found the " theatre of the lord . " by the 19th century more naturalists began to arrive to explore , study and conquer the high peaks ; they were followed by artists , writers and painters . two men who first explored the regions of ice and snow were horace-benedict de saussure ( 1740-1799 ) in the pennine alps , and the benedictine monk of disentis placidus a spescha ( 1752-1833 ) . born in geneva , saussure was enamored with the mountains from an early age ; he left a law career to become a naturalist and spent many years trekking through the bernese oberland , the savoy , the piedmont and valais , studying the glaciers and the geology , as he became an early proponent of the theory of rock upheaval . saussure , in 1787 , was a member of the third ascent of mont blanc - today the summits of all the peaks have been climbed .
the 2011 census recorded that 2,998,264 people or 36.7 % of london 's population are foreign-born making london the city with the second largest immigrant population , behind new york city , in terms of absolute numbers . the table to the right shows the most common countries of birth of london residents . note that some of the german-born population , in 18th position , are british citizens from birth born to parents serving in the british armed forces in germany . with increasing industrialisation , london 's population grew rapidly throughout the 19th and early 20th centuries , and it was for some time in the late 19th and early 20th centuries the most populous city in the world . its population peaked at 8,615,245 in 1939 immediately before the outbreak of the second world war , but had declined to 7,192,091 at the 2001 census . however , the population then grew by just over a million between the 2001 and 2011 censuses , to reach 8,173,941 in the latter enumeration .
after the civil war , population expansion , railroad construction , and the disappearance of the buffalo herds heightened military tensions on the great plains . several tribes , especially the sioux and comanche , fiercely resisted confinement to reservations . the main role of the army was to keep indigenous peoples on reservations and to end their wars against settlers and each other , william tecumseh sherman and philip sheridan were in charge . a famous victory for the plains nations was the battle of the little big horn in 1876 , when col. george armstrong custer and two hundred plus members of the 7th cavalry were killed by a force consisting of native americans from the lakota , northern cheyenne , and arapaho nations . the last significant conflict came in 1891 .
however , memory performance can be enhanced when material is linked to the learning context , even when learning occurs under stress . a separate study by cognitive psychologists schwabe and wolf shows that when retention testing is done in a context similar to or congruent with the original learning task ( i.e. , in the same room ) , memory impairment and the detrimental effects of stress on learning can be attenuated . seventy-two healthy female and male university students , randomly assigned to the secpt stress test or to a control group , were asked to remember the locations of 15 pairs of picture cards - a computerized version of the card game " concentration " or " memory . " the room in which the experiment took place was infused with the scent of vanilla , as odour is a strong cue for memory . retention testing took place the following day , either in the same room with the vanilla scent again present , or in a different room without the fragrance . the memory performance of subjects who experienced stress during the object-location task decreased significantly when they were tested in an unfamiliar room without the vanilla scent ( an incongruent context ) ; however , the memory performance of stressed subjects showed no impairment when they were tested in the original room with the vanilla scent ( a congruent context ) . all participants in the experiment , both stressed and unstressed , performed faster when the learning and retrieval contexts were similar .
the world of clothing is always changing , as new cultural influences meet technological innovations . researchers in scientific labs have been developing prototypes for fabrics that can serve functional purposes well beyond their traditional roles , for example , clothes that can automatically adjust their temperature , repel bullets , project images , and generate electricity . some practical advances already available to consumers are bullet-resistant garments made with kevlar and stain-resistant fabrics that are coated with chemical mixtures that reduce the absorption of liquids .
in the us , one kilowatt-hour ( 3.6 mj ) of electricity currently causes an average 1.34 pounds ( 610 g ) of co2 emission . assuming the average light bulb is on for 10 hours a day , a 40-watt bulb will cause 196 pounds ( 89 kg ) of co2 emission per year . the 6-watt led equivalent will only cause 30 pounds ( 14 kg ) of co2 over the same time span . a building 's carbon footprint from lighting can therefore be reduced by 85 % by exchanging all incandescent bulbs for new leds if a building previously used only incandescent bulbs .
from a military standpoint , lighting is a critical part of the battlefield conditions . shadows are good places to hide , while bright areas are more exposed . it is often beneficial to fight with the sun or other light source behind you , giving your enemy disturbing visual glare and partially hiding your own movements in backlight . if natural light is not present searchlights and flares can be used . however the use of light may disclose your own hidden position and modern warfare have seen increased use of night vision through the use of infrared cameras and image intensifiers .
the united states originally wished to remain neutral when world war i broke out in august 1914 . however , it insisted on its right as a neutral party to immunity from german submarine attack , even though its ships carried food and raw materials to britain . in 1917 the germans resumed submarine attacks , knowing that it would lead to american entry . when the u.s declared war , the u.s. army was still small by european standards and mobilization would take a year . meanwhile , the u.s. continued to provide supplies and money to britain and france , and initiated the first peacetime draft . industrial mobilization took longer than expected , so divisions were sent to europe without equipment , relying instead on the british and french to supply them .
in the 20th century , the paris literary community was dominated by colette , andre gide , francois mauriac , andre malraux , albert camus , and , after world war ii , by simone de beauvoir and jean-paul sartre ; between the wars it was the home of many important expatriate writers , including ernest hemingway , samuel beckett , and , in the 1970s , milan kundera . the winner of the 2014 nobel prize in literature , patrick modiano-who lives in paris- , based most of his literary work on the depiction of the city during world war ii and the 1960s-1970s .
due to reciprocity ( discussed above ) the gain of an antenna used for transmitting must be proportional to its effective area when used for receiving . consider an antenna with no loss , that is , one whose electrical efficiency is 100 % . it can be shown that its effective area averaged over all directions must be equal to λ2 / 4π , the wavelength squared divided by 4π . gain is defined such that the average gain over all directions for an antenna with 100 % electrical efficiency is equal to 1 . therefore , the effective area aeff in terms of the gain g in a given direction is given by :
apart from the passing of noble titles or ranks , inheritance practices did not involve primogeniture ; each son received an equal share of the family property . unlike the practice in later dynasties , the father usually sent his adult married sons away with their portions of the family fortune . daughters received a portion of the family fortune through their marriage dowries , though this was usually much less than the shares of sons . a different distribution of the remainder could be specified in a will , but it is unclear how common this was .
in 1981 , the times and the sunday times were bought from thomson by rupert murdoch 's news international . the acquisition followed three weeks of intensive bargaining with the unions by company negotiators , john collier and bill o 'neill .
during regular , day-to-day activities , somali women usually wear the guntiino , a long stretch of cloth tied over the shoulder and draped around the waist . it is usually made out of alandi , which is a textile common in the horn region and some parts of north africa . the garment can be worn in different styles . it can also be made with other fabrics , including white cloth with gold borders . for more formal settings , such as at weddings or religious celebrations like eid , women wear the dirac . it is a long , light , diaphanous voile dress made of silk , chiffon , taffeta or saree fabric . the gown is worn over a full-length half-slip and a brassiere . known as the gorgorad , the underskirt is made out of silk and serves as a key part of the overall outfit . the dirac is usually sparkly and very colorful , the most popular styles being those with gilded borders or threads . the fabric is typically acquired from somali clothing stores in tandem with the gorgorad . in the past , dirac fabric was also frequently purchased from south asian merchandisers .
before the war , many observers believed the us and its allies could win but might suffer substantial casualties ( certainly more than any conflict since vietnam ) , and that the tank battles across the harsh desert might rival those of north africa during world war ii . after nearly 50 years of proxy wars , and constant fears of another war in europe between nato and the warsaw pact , some thought the persian gulf war might finally answer the question of which military philosophy would have reigned supreme . iraqi forces were battle-hardened after 8 years of war with iran , and they were well equipped with late model soviet tanks and jet fighters , but the antiaircraft weapons were crippled ; in comparison , the us had no large-scale combat experience since its withdrawal from vietnam nearly 20 years earlier , and major changes in us doctrine , equipment and technology since then had never been tested under fire .
john 's position in france was considerably strengthened by the victory at mirebeau , but john 's treatment of his new prisoners and of his ally , william de roches , quickly undermined these gains . de roches was a powerful anjou noble , but john largely ignored him , causing considerable offence , whilst the king kept the rebel leaders in such bad conditions that twenty-two of them died . at this time most of the regional nobility were closely linked through kinship , and this behaviour towards their relatives was regarded as unacceptable . william de roches and other of john 's regional allies in anjou and brittany deserted him in favour of philip , and brittany rose in fresh revolt . john 's financial situation was tenuous : once factors such as the comparative military costs of materiel and soldiers were taken into account , philip enjoyed a considerable , although not overwhelming , advantage of resources over john .

in 2001 , fuller , cowell , and tv producer simon jones attempted to sell the pop idol format to the united states , but the idea was met with poor response from united states television networks . however , rupert murdoch , head of fox 's parent company , was persuaded to buy the show by his daughter elisabeth , who was a fan of the british show . the show was renamed american idol : the search for a superstar and debuted in the summer of 2002 . cowell was initially offered the job as showrunner but refused ; lythgoe then took over that position . much to cowell 's surprise , it became one of the hit shows for the summer that year . the show , with the personal engagement of the viewers with the contestants through voting , and the presence of the acid-tongued cowell as a judge , grew into a phenomenon . by 2004 , it had become the most-watched show in the u.s. , a position it then held on for seven consecutive seasons .
in response to pro-tibet and pro-human rights protests , the chinese media focused on the more disruptive protesters , referring for example to " a very small number of ' tibet independence ' secessionists and a handful of so-called human rights-minded ngo activists " intent on " disrupting and sabotaging the beijing olympic games . " however , the chinese media published articles about crowds supporting the torch relay .
these 4g languages are less procedural than 3g languages . the benefit of 4gl is that it provides ways to obtain information without requiring the direct help of a programmer . example of 4gl is sql .
furthermore , apple had created too many similar models that confused potential buyers . at one point , its product lineup was subdivided into classic , lc , ii , quadra , performa , and centris models , with essentially the same computer being sold under a number of different names . these models competed against macintosh clones , hardware manufactured by third parties that ran apple 's system 7 . this succeeded in increasing the macintosh 's market share somewhat , and provided cheaper hardware for consumers , but hurt apple financially as existing apple customers began to buy cheaper clones which cannibalized the sales of apple 's higher-margin macintosh systems , yet apple still shouldered the burden of developing the mac os platform .
with the end of the war with japan , the chinese civil war resumed between the chinese communists and the chinese nationalists . while the communists were struggling for supremacy in manchuria , they were supported by the north korean government with materiel and manpower . according to chinese sources , the north koreans donated 2,000 railway cars worth of materiel while thousands of koreans served in the chinese people 's liberation army ( pla ) during the war . north korea also provided the chinese communists in manchuria with a safe refuge for non-combatants and communications with the rest of china .
the statistics portugal ( portuguese : ine - instituto nacional de estatistica ) estimates that , according to the 2011 census , the population was 10,562,178 ( of which 52 % was female , 48 % was male ) . this population has been relatively homogeneous for most of its history : a single religion ( catholicism ) and a single language have contributed to this ethnic and national unity , namely after the expulsion of the moors and jews . a considerable number of moors and jews , nevertheless , stayed in portugal , under the condition that they converted to catholicism , and afterwards they were known as mouriscos ( former muslims ) and cristaos novos ( new christians or former jews ) some of whom may have continued to observe rabbinic judaism in secret , as in the case of the secret jews of belmonte , who now observe the jewish faith openly . after 1772 the distinction between old and new christians was abolished by decree . some famous portuguese new christians were the mathematician pedro nunes and the physician and naturalist garcia de orta .
the ipod is a line of portable media players and multi-purpose pocket computers designed and marketed by apple inc . the first line was released on october 23 , 2001 , about 8 ½ months after itunes ( macintosh version ) was released . the most recent ipod redesigns were announced on july 15 , 2015 . there are three current versions of the ipod : the ultra-compact ipod shuffle , the compact ipod nano and the touchscreen ipod touch .
a brewery tap is the nearest outlet for a brewery 's beers . this is usually a room or bar in the brewery itself , though the name may be applied to the nearest pub . the term is not applied to a brewpub which brews and sells its beer on the same premises .
the polish nobility differed in many respects from the nobility of other countries . the most important difference was that , while in most european countries the nobility lost power as the ruler strove for absolute monarchy , in poland the reverse process occurred : the nobility actually gained power at the expense of the king , and the political system evolved into an oligarchy .
additionally , genes can have regulatory regions many kilobases upstream or downstream of the open reading frame . these act by binding to transcription factors which then cause the dna to loop so that the regulatory sequence ( and bound transcription factor ) become close to the rna polymerase binding site . for example , enhancers increase transcription by binding an activator protein which then helps to recruit the rna polymerase to the promoter ; conversely silencers bind repressor proteins and make the dna less available for rna polymerase .
somali cuisine varies from region to region and consists of a fusion of diverse culinary influences . it is the product of somalia 's rich tradition of trade and commerce . despite the variety , there remains one thing that unites the various regional cuisines : all food is served halal . there are therefore no pork dishes , alcohol is not served , nothing that died on its own is eaten , and no blood is incorporated .
it gained great momentum in the 18th and 19th centuries with the emergence of methodism and the great awakenings in britain and north america . the origins of evangelicalism are usually traced back to the english methodist movement , nicolaus zinzendorf , the moravian church , lutheran pietism , presbyterianism and puritanism . among leaders and major figures of the evangelical protestant movement were john wesley , george whitefield , jonathan edwards , billy graham , harold john ockenga , john stott and martyn lloyd-jones .
the history of the greek people is closely associated with the history of greece , cyprus , constantinople , asia minor and the black sea . during the ottoman rule of greece , a number of greek enclaves around the mediterranean were cut off from the core , notably in southern italy , the caucasus , syria and egypt . by the early 20th century , over half of the overall greek-speaking population was settled in asia minor ( now turkey ) , while later that century a huge wave of migration to the united states , australia , canada and elsewhere created the modern greek diaspora .
isps provide internet access , employing a range of technologies to connect users to their network . available technologies have ranged from computer modems with acoustic couplers to telephone lines , to television cable ( catv ) , wireless ethernet ( wi-fi ) , and fiber optics .
according to john n. gray , popper held that " a theory is scientific only in so far as it is falsifiable , and should be given up as soon as it is falsified . " by applying popper 's account of scientific method , gray 's straw dogs states that this would have " killed the theories of darwin and einstein at birth . " when they were first advanced , gray claims , each of them was " at odds with some available evidence ; only later did evidence become available that gave them crucial support . " against this , gray seeks to establish the irrationalist thesis that " the progress of science comes from acting against reason . "
the 2010 maternal mortality rate per 100,000 births for guinea bissau was 1000 . this compares with 804.3 in 2008 and 966 in 1990 . the under 5 mortality rate , per 1,000 births , was 195 and the neonatal mortality as a percentage of under 5 's mortality was 24 . the number of midwives per 1,000 live births was 3 ; one out of eighteen pregnant women die as a result of pregnancy . according to a 2013 unicef report , 50 % of women in guinea bissau had undergone female genital mutilation . in 2010 , guinea bissau had the 7th highest maternal mortality rate in the world .
former members heather and gary botting compare the cultural paradigms of the religion to george orwell 's nineteen eighty-four , and alan rogerson describes the religion 's leadership as totalitarian . other critics charge that by disparaging individual decision-making , the religion 's leaders cultivate a system of unquestioning obedience in which witnesses abrogate all responsibility and rights over their personal lives . critics also accuse the religion 's leaders of exercising " intellectual dominance " over witnesses , controlling information and creating " mental isolation , " which former governing body member raymond franz argued were all elements of mind control .
the western section of the state is part of the appalachian mountain range . among the subranges of the appalachians located in the state are the great smoky mountains , blue ridge mountains , great balsam mountains , and black mountains . the black mountains are the highest in the eastern united states , and culminate in mount mitchell at 6,684 feet ( 2,037 m ) the highest point east of the mississippi river . although agriculture still remains important , tourism has become a dominant industry in the mountains . growing christmas trees has recently become an important industry as well . because of the higher altitude , the climate in the mountains often differs markedly from that of the rest of the state . winter in western north carolina typically features high snowfall and subfreezing temperatures more akin to those of a midwestern state than of a southern state .
interactions between alcohol and certain antibiotics may occur and may cause side-effects and decreased effectiveness of antibiotic therapy . while moderate alcohol consumption is unlikely to interfere with many common antibiotics , there are specific types of antibiotics with which alcohol consumption may cause serious side-effects . therefore , potential risks of side-effects and effectiveness depend on the type of antibiotic administered . despite the lack of a categorical counterindication , the belief that alcohol and antibiotics should never be mixed is widespread .
the term " house music " is said to have originated from a chicago club called the warehouse , which existed from 1977 to 1983 . clubbers to the warehouse were primarily black and gay , who came to dance to music played by the club 's resident dj frankie knuckles , whom fans refer to as the " godfather of house . " after the warehouse closed in 1983 , the crowds went to knuckles ' new club , the power plant . in the channel 4 documentary pump up the volume , knuckles remarks that the first time he heard the term " house music " was upon seeing " we play house music " on a sign in the window of a bar on chicago 's south side . one of the people in the car with him joked , " you know , that 's the kind of music you play down at the warehouse ! , " and then everybody laughed . south-side chicago dj leonard " remix " roy , in self-published statements , claims he put such a sign in a tavern window because it was where he played music that one might find in one 's home ; in his case , it referred to his mother 's soul & disco records , which he worked into his sets . farley jackmaster funk was quoted as saying " in 1982 , i was djing at a club called the playground and there was this kid named leonard ' remix ' roy who was a dj at a rival club called the rink . he came over to my club one night , and into the dj booth and said to me , ' i 've got the gimmick that 's gonna take all the people out of your club and into mine - it 's called house music . ' now , where he got that name from or what made him think of it i don 't know , so the answer lies with him . "
the xbox 360 's original graphical user interface was the xbox 360 dashboard ; a tabbed interface that featured five " blades " ( formerly four blades ) , and was designed by akqa and audiobrain . it could be launched automatically when the console booted without a disc in it , or when the disc tray was ejected , but the user had the option to select what the console does if a game is in the tray on start up , or if inserted when already on . a simplified version of it was also accessible at any time via the xbox guide button on the gamepad . this simplified version showed the user 's gamercard , xbox live messages and friends list . it also allowed for personal and music settings , in addition to voice or video chats , or returning to the xbox dashboard from the game .
all of the highways into wenchuan , and others throughout the province , were damaged , resulting in delayed arrival of the rescue troops . in beichuan county , 80 % of the buildings collapsed according to xinhua news . in the city of shifang , the collapse of two chemical plants led to leakage of some 80 tons of liquid ammonia , with hundreds of people reported buried . in the city of dujiangyan , south-east of the epicenter , a whole school collapsed with 900 students buried and fewer than 60 survived . the juyuan middle school , where many teenagers were buried , was excavated by civilians and cranes . dujiangyan is home of the dujiangyan irrigation system , an ancient water diversion project which is still in use and is a unesco world heritage site . the project 's famous fish mouth was cracked but not severely damaged otherwise .
in 1853 , victoria gave birth to her eighth child , leopold , with the aid of the new anaesthetic , chloroform . victoria was so impressed by the relief it gave from the pain of childbirth that she used it again in 1857 at the birth of her ninth and final child , beatrice , despite opposition from members of the clergy , who considered it against biblical teaching , and members of the medical profession , who thought it dangerous . victoria may have suffered from post-natal depression after many of her pregnancies . letters from albert to victoria intermittently complain of her loss of self-control . for example , about a month after leopold 's birth albert complained in a letter to victoria about her " continuance of hysterics " over a " miserable trifle . "
the migrations and invasions of the 4th and 5th centuries disrupted trade networks around the mediterranean . african goods stopped being imported into europe , first disappearing from the interior and by the 7th century found only in a few cities such as rome or naples . by the end of the 7th century , under the impact of the muslim conquests , african products were no longer found in western europe . the replacement of goods from long-range trade with local products was a trend throughout the old roman lands that happened in the early middle ages . this was especially marked in the lands that did not lie on the mediterranean , such as northern gaul or britain . non-local goods appearing in the archaeological record are usually luxury goods . in the northern parts of europe , not only were the trade networks local , but the goods carried were simple , with little pottery or other complex products . around the mediterranean , pottery remained prevalent and appears to have been traded over medium-range networks , not just produced locally .
in november 2008 , economist dean baker observed : " there is a really good reason for tighter credit . tens of millions of homeowners who had substantial equity in their homes two years ago have little or nothing today . businesses are facing the worst downturn since the great depression . this matters for credit decisions . a homeowner with equity in her home is very unlikely to default on a car loan or credit card debt . they will draw on this equity rather than lose their car and / or have a default placed on their credit record . on the other hand , a homeowner who has no equity is a serious default risk . in the case of businesses , their creditworthiness depends on their future profits . profit prospects look much worse in november 2008 than they did in november 2007 ... while many banks are obviously at the brink , consumers and businesses would be facing a much harder time getting credit right now even if the financial system were rock solid . the problem with the economy is the loss of close to $ 6 trillion in housing wealth and an even larger amount of stock wealth .
guinea-bissau 's gdp per capita is one of the lowest in the world , and its human development index is one of the lowest on earth . more than two-thirds of the population lives below the poverty line . the economy depends mainly on agriculture ; fish , cashew nuts and ground nuts are its major exports .
union station is further served by four amtrak lines : the northeast regional and the high-speed acela express provide service to new york , washington , d.c. and boston , and rank as the first and second busiest routes in the country ; the new haven-springfield line provides service to hartford and springfield , massachusetts ; and the vermonter provides service to both washington , d.c. , and vermont , 15 miles ( 24 km ) from the canadian border . amtrak also codeshares with united airlines for travel to any airport serviced by united airlines , via newark airport ( ewr ) originating from or terminating at union station , ( iata : zve ) .
an alloy of aluminium and gallium in pellet form added to water can be used to generate hydrogen . the process also produces alumina , but the expensive gallium , which prevents the formation of an oxide skin on the pellets , can be re-used . this has important potential implications for a hydrogen economy , as hydrogen can be produced on-site and does not need to be transported .
the first written account of a game played was on october 15 , 1862 , on the montreal cricket grounds . it was between the first battalion grenadier guards and the second battalion scots fusilier guards resulting in a win by the grenadier guards 3 goals , 2 rouges to nothing . [ citation needed ] in 1864 , at trinity college , toronto , f. barlow cumberland , frederick a. bethune , and christopher gwynn , one of the founders of milton , massachusetts , devised rules based on rugby football . the game gradually gained a following , with the hamilton football club formed on november 3 , 1869 , ( the oldest football club in canada ) . montreal formed a team april 8 , 1872 , toronto was formed on october 4 , 1873 , and the ottawa fbc on september 20 , 1876 .
application of the term " indian " originated with christopher columbus , who , in his search for asia , thought that he had arrived in the east indies . the americas came to be known as the " west indies , " a name still used to refer to the islands of the caribbean sea . this led to the names " indies " and " indian , " which implied some kind of racial or cultural unity among the aboriginal peoples of the americas . this unifying concept , codified in law , religion , and politics , was not originally accepted by indigenous peoples but has been embraced by many over the last two centuries . [ citation needed ] even though the term " indian " does not include the aleuts , inuit , or yupik peoples , these groups are considered indigenous peoples of the americas .
the emergence of antibiotic resistance has prompted restrictions on their use in the uk in 1970 ( swann report 1969 ) , and the eu has banned the use of antibiotics as growth-promotional agents since 2003 . moreover , several organizations ( e.g. , the american society for microbiology ( asm ) , american public health association ( apha ) and the american medical association ( ama ) ) have called for restrictions on antibiotic use in food animal production and an end to all nontherapeutic uses . [ citation needed ] however , commonly there are delays in regulatory and legislative actions to limit the use of antibiotics , attributable partly to resistance against such regulation by industries using or selling antibiotics , and to the time required for research to test causal links between their use and resistance to them . two federal bills ( s.742 and h.r. 2562 ) aimed at phasing out nontherapeutic use of antibiotics in us food animals were proposed , but have not passed . these bills were endorsed by public health and medical organizations , including the american holistic nurses ' association , the american medical association , and the american public health association ( apha ) .
in 1854 president antonio lopez de santa anna enlarged the area of the federal district almost eightfold from the original 220 to 1,700 km2 ( 80 to 660 sq mi ) , annexing the rural and mountainous areas to secure the strategic mountain passes to the south and southwest to protect the city in event of a foreign invasion . ( the mexican-american war had just been fought . ) the last changes to the limits of the federal district were made between 1898 and 1902 , reducing the area to the current 1,479 km2 ( 571 sq mi ) by adjusting the southern border with the state of morelos . by that time , the total number of municipalities within the federal district was twenty-two .
some rock musicians today use mandolins , often single-stringed electric models rather than double-stringed acoustic mandolins . one example is tim brennan of the irish-american punk rock band dropkick murphys . in addition to electric guitar , bass , and drums , the band uses several instruments associated with traditional celtic music , including mandolin , tin whistle , and great highland bagpipes . the band explains that these instruments accentuate the growling sound they favor . the 1991 r.e.m. hit " losing my religion " was driven by a few simple mandolin licks played by guitarist peter buck , who also played the mandolin in nearly a dozen other songs . the single peaked at no. 4 on the billboard hot 100 chart ( # 1 on the rock and alternative charts ) , luther dickinson of north mississippi allstars and the black crowes has made frequent use of the mandolin , most notably on the black crowes song " locust street . " armenian american rock group system of a down makes extensive use of the mandolin on their 2005 double album mezmerize / hypnotize . pop punk band green day has used a mandolin in several occasions , especially on their 2000 album , warning . boyd tinsley , violin player of the dave matthews band has been using an electric mandolin since 2005 . frontman colin meloy and guitarist chris funk of the decemberists regularly employ the mandolin in the band 's music . nancy wilson , rhythm guitarist of heart , uses a mandolin in heart 's song " dream of the archer " from the album little queen , as well as in heart 's cover of led zeppelin 's song " the battle of evermore . " " show me heaven " by maria mckee , the theme song to the film days of thunder , prominently features a mandolin .

northwestern was elected to the association of american universities in 1917 and remains a research university with " very high " research activity . northwestern 's schools of management , engineering , and communication are among the most academically productive in the nation . northwestern received $ 550 million in research funding in 2014 . northwestern supports nearly 1,500 research laboratories across two campuses , predominately in the medical and biological sciences . through the innovation and new ventures office ( invo ) , northwestern researchers disclosed 247 inventions , filed 270 patents applications , received 81 foreign and us patents , started 12 companies , and generated $ 79.8 million in licensing revenue in 2013 . the bulk of revenue has come from a patent on pregabalin , a synthesized organic molecule discovered by chemistry professor richard silverman , which ultimately was marketed as lyrica , a drug sold by pfizer , to combat epilepsy , neuropathic pain , and fibromyalgia . invo has been involved in creating a number of centers , including the center for developmental therapeutics ( cdt ) and the center for device development ( cd2 ) . it has also helped form over 50 northwestern startup companies based on northwestern technologies .
in many societies , beer is the most popular alcoholic drink . various social traditions and activities are associated with beer drinking , such as playing cards , darts , or other pub games ; attending beer festivals ; engaging in zythology ( the study of beer ) ; visiting a series of pubs in one evening ; visiting breweries ; beer-oriented tourism ; or rating beer . drinking games , such as beer pong , are also popular . a relatively new profession is that of the beer sommelier , who informs restaurant patrons about beers and food pairings .
devotion is an important part of the practice of most buddhists . devotional practices include bowing , offerings , pilgrimage , and chanting . in pure land buddhism , devotion to the buddha amitabha is the main practice . in nichiren buddhism , devotion to the lotus sutra is the main practice .
beer ranges from less than 3 % alcohol by volume ( abv ) to around 14 % abv , though this strength can be increased to around 20 % by re-pitching with champagne yeast , and to 55 % abv by the freeze-distilling process . the alcohol content of beer varies by local practice or beer style . the pale lagers that most consumers are familiar with fall in the range of 4-6 % , with a typical abv of 5 % . the customary strength of british ales is quite low , with many session beers being around 4 % abv . some beers , such as table beer are of such low alcohol content ( 1 % -4 % ) that they are served instead of soft drinks in some schools .
in australia , a technical issue arose with the royal assent in both 1976 and 2001 . in 1976 , a bill originating in the house of representatives was mistakenly submitted to the governor-general and assented to . however , it was later discovered that it had not been passed by each house . the error arose because two bills of the same title had originated from the house . the governor-general revoked the first assent , before assenting to the bill which had actually passed . the same procedure was followed to correct a similar error which arose in 2001 .
a. tom grunfeld says that tsongkhapa claimed ill health in his refusal to appear at the ming court , while rossabi adds that tsongkhapa cited the " length and arduousness of the journey " to china as another reason not to make an appearance . this first request by the ming was made in 1407 , but the ming court sent another embassy in 1413 , this one led by the eunuch hou xian ( 候顯 ; fl . 1403-1427 ) , which was again refused by tsongkhapa . rossabi writes that tsongkhapa did not want to entirely alienate the ming court , so he sent his disciple chosrje shakya yeshes to nanjing in 1414 on his behalf , and upon his arrival in 1415 the yongle emperor bestowed upon him the title of " state teacher " - the same title earlier awarded the phagmodrupa ruler of tibet . the xuande emperor ( r . 1425-1435 ) even granted this disciple chosrje shakya yeshes the title of a " king " ( 王 ) . this title does not appear to have held any practical meaning , or to have given its holder any power , at tsongkhapa 's ganden monastery . wylie notes that this - like the karma kargyu - cannot be seen as a reappointment of mongol yuan offices , since the gelug school was created after the fall of the yuan dynasty .
hindu philosophy also includes several sub-schools of theistic philosophies that integrate ideas from two or more of the six orthodox philosophies , such as the realism of the nyaya , the naturalism of the vaisesika , the dualism of the sankhya , the monism and knowledge of self as essential to liberation of advaita , the self-discipline of yoga and the asceticism and elements of theistic ideas . examples of such schools include pasupata saiva , saiva siddhanta , pratyabhijna , rasesvara and vaisnava . some sub-schools share tantric ideas with those found in some buddhist traditions . the ideas of these sub-schools are found in the puranas and agamas .
forests cover 24 percent of oklahoma and prairie grasslands composed of shortgrass , mixed-grass , and tallgrass prairie , harbor expansive ecosystems in the state 's central and western portions , although cropland has largely replaced native grasses . where rainfall is sparse in the western regions of the state , shortgrass prairie and shrublands are the most prominent ecosystems , though pinyon pines , red cedar ( junipers ) , and ponderosa pines grow near rivers and creek beds in the far western reaches of the panhandle . southwestern oklahoma contains many rare , disjunct species including sugar maple , bigtooth maple , nolina and southern live oak .
during the risorgimento , proponents of italian republicanism and italian nationalism , such as alessandro manzoni , stressed the importance of establishing a uniform national language in order to better create an italian national identity . with the unification of italy in the 1860s , standard italian became the official national language of the new italian state , while the various unofficial regional languages of italy gradually became regarded as subordinate " dialects " to italian , increasingly associated negatively with lack of education or provincialism . however , at the time of the italian unification , standard italian still existed mainly as a literary language , and only 2.5 % of italy 's population could speak standard italian .
like most other regions of central and southern germany , thuringia has a significant industrial sector reaching back to the mid-19th-century industrialisation . the economic transition after the german reunification in 1990 led to the closure of most large-scale factories and companies , leaving small and medium-sized ones to dominate the manufacturing sector . well-known industrial centres are jena ( a world centre for optical instruments with companies like carl zeiss , schott and jenoptik ) and eisenach , where bmw started its car production in the 1920s and an opel factory is based today . the most important industrial branches today are engineering and metalworking , vehicle production and food industries . especially the small and mid-sized towns in central and southwestern thuringia ( e.g. arnstadt , schmalkalden and ohrdruf ) are highly industrialised , whereas there are fewer industrial companies in the northern and eastern parts of the land . traditional industries like production of glass , porcelain and toys collapsed during the economic crises between 1930 and 1990 .
the trans-alaska pipeline can transport and pump up to 2.1 million barrels ( 330,000 m3 ) of crude oil per day , more than any other crude oil pipeline in the united states . additionally , substantial coal deposits are found in alaska 's bituminous , sub-bituminous , and lignite coal basins . the united states geological survey estimates that there are 85.4 trillion cubic feet ( 2,420 km3 ) of undiscovered , technically recoverable gas from natural gas hydrates on the alaskan north slope . alaska also offers some of the highest hydroelectric power potential in the country from its numerous rivers . large swaths of the alaskan coastline offer wind and geothermal energy potential as well .
the movement was pioneered by georges braque and pablo picasso , joined by jean metzinger , albert gleizes , robert delaunay , henri le fauconnier , fernand leger and juan gris . a primary influence that led to cubism was the representation of three-dimensional form in the late works of paul cezanne . a retrospective of cezanne 's paintings had been held at the salon d 'automne of 1904 , current works were displayed at the 1905 and 1906 salon d 'automne , followed by two commemorative retrospectives after his death in 1907 .
the house which forms the architectural core of the palace was built for the first duke of buckingham and normanby in 1703 to the design of william winde . the style chosen was of a large , three-floored central block with two smaller flanking service wings . buckingham house was eventually sold by buckingham 's descendant , sir charles sheffield , in 1761 to george iii for £ 21,000 . sheffield 's leasehold on the mulberry garden site , the freehold of which was still owned by the royal family , was due to expire in 1774 .
the serbian revolution ( 1804-1815 ) marked the beginning of an era of national awakening in the balkans during the eastern question . suzerainty of serbia as a hereditary monarchy under its own dynasty was acknowledged de jure in 1830 . in 1821 , the greeks declared war on the sultan . a rebellion that originated in moldavia as a diversion was followed by the main revolution in the peloponnese , which , along with the northern part of the gulf of corinth , became the first parts of the ottoman empire to achieve independence ( in 1829 ) . by the mid-19th century , the ottoman empire was called the " sick man " by europeans . the suzerain states - the principality of serbia , wallachia , moldavia and montenegro - moved towards de jure independence during the 1860s and 1870s .
the permian-triassic extinction event , which was a prolonged event due to the accumulation of several extinction pulses , ended the dominance of the carnivores among the therapsids . in the early triassic , all the medium to large land carnivore niches were taken over by archosaurs which , over an extended period of time ( 35 million years ) , came to include the crocodylomorphs , the pterosaurs , and the dinosaurs . by the jurassic , the dinosaurs had come to dominate the large terrestrial herbivore niches as well .
the estonian academy of arts ( estonian : eesti kunstiakadeemia , eka ) is providing higher education in art , design , architecture , media , art history and conservation while viljandi culture academy of university of tartu has an approach to popularise native culture through such curricula as native construction , native blacksmithing , native textile design , traditional handicraft and traditional music , but also jazz and church music . in 2010 , there were 245 museums in estonia whose combined collections contain more than 10 million objects .
official figures ( as of july 21 , 2008 12 : 00 cst ) stated that 69,197 were confirmed dead , including 68,636 in sichuan province , and 374,176 injured , with 18,222 listed as missing . the earthquake left about 4.8 million people homeless , though the number could be as high as 11 million . approximately 15 million people lived in the affected area . it was the deadliest earthquake to hit china since the 1976 tangshan earthquake , which killed at least 240,000 people , and the strongest in the country since the 1950 chayu earthquake , which registered at 8.5 on the richter magnitude scale . it is the 21st deadliest earthquake of all time . on november 6 , 2008 , the central government announced that it would spend 1 trillion rmb ( about us $ 146.5 billion ) over the next three years to rebuild areas ravaged by the earthquake , as part of the chinese economic stimulus program .
aburish asserts that nasser was not distressed by his frequent relocations , which broadened his horizons and showed him egyptian society 's class divisions . his own social status was well below the wealthy egyptian elite , and his discontent with those born into wealth and power grew throughout his lifetime . nasser spent most of his spare time reading , particularly in 1933 when he lived near the national library of egypt . he read the qur 'an , the sayings of muhammad , the lives of the sahaba ( muhammad 's companions ) , and the biographies of nationalist leaders napoleon , ataturk , otto von bismarck , and garibaldi and the autobiography of winston churchill .
thailand : the april 18 relay through bangkok was the olympic flame 's first visit to thailand . the relay covered just over 10 km , and included bangkok 's chinatown . the torch was carried past democracy monument , chitralada palace and a number of other city landmarks . m.r. narisa chakrabongse , green world foundation ( gwf ) chairwoman , withdrew from the torch-running ceremony , protesting against china 's actions in tibet . several hundred protesters were present , along with olympic supporters . thai authorities threatened to arrest foreign protesters and ban them from future entry into thailand . a coalition of thai human rights groups announced that it would organise a " small demonstration " during the relay , and several hundred people did indeed take part in protests , facing beijing supporters . intended torchbearer mom rajawongse narissara chakrabongse boycotted the relay , to protest against china 's actions in tibet . in bangkok , students told the media that the chinese embassy provided them with transportation and gave them shirts to wear .
beyonce embarked on the mrs. carter show world tour on april 15 in belgrade , serbia ; the tour included 132 dates that ran through to march 2014 . it became the most successful tour of her career and one of the most-successful tours of all time . in may , beyonce 's cover of amy winehouse 's " back to black " with andre 3000 on the great gatsby soundtrack was released . she was also honorary chair of the 2013 met gala . beyonce voiced queen tara in the 3d cgi animated film , epic , released by 20th century fox on may 24 , and recorded an original song for the film , " rise up , " co-written with sia .
the region is serviced by 4,200 km ( 2,600 mi ) of roads used by 6 million vehicles . train travel is well established in the alps , with , for instance 120 km ( 75 mi ) of track for every 1,000 km2 ( 390 sq mi ) in a country such as switzerland . most of europe 's highest railways are located there . moreover , plans are underway to build a 57 km ( 35 mi ) -long sub-alpine tunnel connecting the older lotschberg and gotthard tunnels built in the 19th century .
the main representatives of the new style , often referred to as ars nova as opposed to the ars antiqua , were the composers philippe de vitry and guillaume de machaut . in italy , where the provencal troubadours had also found refuge , the corresponding period goes under the name of trecento , and the leading composers were giovanni da cascia , jacopo da bologna and francesco landini . prominent reformer of orthodox church music from the first half of 14th century was john kukuzelis ; he also introduced a system of notation widely used in the balkans in the following centuries .
through victoria 's reign , the gradual establishment of a modern constitutional monarchy in britain continued . reforms of the voting system increased the power of the house of commons at the expense of the house of lords and the monarch . in 1867 , walter bagehot wrote that the monarch only retained " the right to be consulted , the right to encourage , and the right to warn . " as victoria 's monarchy became more symbolic than political , it placed a strong emphasis on morality and family values , in contrast to the sexual , financial and personal scandals that had been associated with previous members of the house of hanover and which had discredited the monarchy . the concept of the " family monarchy , " with which the burgeoning middle classes could identify , was solidified .
in the hindgut ( element 16 in numbered diagram ) , or proctodaeum , undigested food particles are joined by uric acid to form fecal pellets . the rectum absorbs 90 % of the water in these fecal pellets , and the dry pellet is then eliminated through the anus ( element 17 ) , completing the process of digestion . the uric acid is formed using hemolymph waste products diffused from the malpighian tubules ( element 20 ) . it is then emptied directly into the alimentary canal , at the junction between the midgut and hindgut . the number of malpighian tubules possessed by a given insect varies between species , ranging from only two tubules in some insects to over 100 tubules in others . : 71-72 , 78-80
the heavy infantry of the maniples were supported by a number of light infantry and cavalry troops , typically 300 horsemen per manipular legion . the cavalry was drawn primarily from the richest class of equestrians . there was an additional class of troops who followed the army without specific martial roles and were deployed to the rear of the third line . their role in accompanying the army was primarily to supply any vacancies that might occur in the maniples . the light infantry consisted of 1,200 unarmoured skirmishing troops drawn from the youngest and lower social classes . they were armed with a sword and a small shield , as well as several light javelins .
about 30 people have been indicted for participating in genocide or complicity in genocide during the early 1990s in bosnia . to date , after several plea bargains and some convictions that were successfully challenged on appeal two men , vujadin popovic and ljubisa beara , have been found guilty of committing genocide , zdravko tolimir has been found guilty of committing genocide and conspiracy to commit genocide , and two others , radislav krstic and drago nikolic , have been found guilty of aiding and abetting genocide . three others have been found guilty of participating in genocides in bosnia by german courts , one of whom nikola jorgic lost an appeal against his conviction in the european court of human rights . a further eight men , former members of the bosnian serb security forces were found guilty of genocide by the state court of bosnia and herzegovina ( see list of bosnian genocide prosecutions ) .
in 2011 , spielberg launched falling skies , a science fiction television series , on the tnt network . he developed the series with robert rodat and is credited as an executive producer . spielberg is also producing the fox tv series terra nova . terra nova begins in the year 2149 when all life on the planet earth is threatened with extinction resulting in scientists opening a door that allows people to travel back 85 million years to prehistoric times . spielberg also produced the river , smash , under the dome , extant and the whispers , as well as a tv adaptation of minority report .
genes are regulated so that they are expressed only when the product is needed , since expression draws on limited resources . : 7 a cell regulates its gene expression depending on its external environment ( e.g. available nutrients , temperature and other stresses ) , its internal environment ( e.g. cell division cycle , metabolism , infection status ) , and its specific role if in a multicellular organism . gene expression can be regulated at any step : from transcriptional initiation , to rna processing , to post-translational modification of the protein . the regulation of lactose metabolism genes in e. coli ( lac operon ) was the first such mechanism to be described in 1961 .
the 21 nocturnes are more structured , and of greater emotional depth , than those of field ( whom chopin met in 1833 ) . many of the chopin nocturnes have middle sections marked by agitated expression ( and often making very difficult demands on the performer ) which heightens their dramatic character .
americans of english descent and americans of scots-irish descent began moving into northern florida from the backwoods of georgia and south carolina . though technically not allowed by the spanish authorities , the spanish were never able to effectively police the border region and the backwoods settlers from the united states would continue to migrate into florida unchecked . these migrants , mixing with the already present british settlers who had remained in florida since the british period , would be the progenitors of the population known as florida crackers .
four boarders at his parents ' apartments became chopin 's intimates : tytus woyciechowski , jan nepomucen białobłocki , jan matuszynski and julian fontana ; the latter two would become part of his paris milieu . he was friendly with members of warsaw 's young artistic and intellectual world , including fontana , jozef bohdan zaleski and stefan witwicki . he was also attracted to the singing student konstancja gładkowska . in letters to woyciechowski , he indicated which of his works , and even which of their passages , were influenced by his fascination with her ; his letter of 15 may 1830 revealed that the slow movement ( larghetto ) of his piano concerto no. 1 ( in e minor ) was secretly dedicated to her - " it should be like dreaming in beautiful springtime - by moonlight . " his final conservatory report ( july 1829 ) read : " chopin f. , third-year student , exceptional talent , musical genius . "
despite efforts to revive hebrew as the national language of the jewish people , knowledge of the language is not commonly possessed by jews worldwide and english has emerged as the lingua franca of the jewish diaspora . although many jews once had sufficient knowledge of hebrew to study the classic literature , and jewish languages like yiddish and ladino were commonly used as recently as the early 20th century , most jews lack such knowledge today and english has by and large superseded most jewish vernaculars . the three most commonly spoken languages among jews today are hebrew , english , and russian . some romance languages , particularly french and spanish , are also widely used . yiddish has been spoken by more jews in history than any other language , but it is far less used today following the holocaust and the adoption of modern hebrew by the zionist movement and the state of israel . in some places , the mother language of the jewish community differs from that of the general population or the dominant group . for example , in quebec , the ashkenazic majority has adopted english , while the sephardic minority uses french as its primary language . similarly , south african jews adopted english rather than afrikaans . due to both czarist and soviet policies , russian has superseded yiddish as the language of russian jews , but these policies have also affected neighboring communities . today , russian is the first language for many jewish communities in a number of post-soviet states , such as ukraine and uzbekistan , as well as for ashkenazic jews in azerbaijan , georgia , and tajikistan . although communities in north africa today are small and dwindling , jews there had shifted from a multilingual group to a monolingual one ( or nearly so ) , speaking french in algeria , morocco , and the city of tunis , while most north africans continue to use arabic as their mother tongue .

due to its large size and wide range of geographic features , the united states contains examples of nearly every global climate . the climate is temperate in most areas , subtropical in the southern united states , tropical in hawaii and southern florida , polar in alaska , semiarid in the great plains west of the 100th meridian , mediterranean in coastal california and arid in the great basin . its comparatively favorable agricultural climate contributed ( in part ) to the country 's rise as a world power , with infrequent severe drought in the major agricultural regions , a general lack of widespread flooding , and a mainly temperate climate that receives adequate precipitation .
after the death of the replacement bishop gregory in 345 , constans used his influence to allow athanasius to return to alexandria in october 345 , amidst the enthusiastic demonstrations of the populace . this began a " golden decade " of peace and prosperity , during which time athanasius assembled several documents relating to his exiles and returns from exile in the apology against the arians . however , upon constans 's death in 350 , another civil war broke out , which left pro-arian constantius as sole emperor . an alexandria local council in 350 replaced ( or reaffirmed ) athanasius in his see .
the figure of the " tragic octoroon " was a stock character of abolitionist literature : a mixed-race woman raised as if a white woman in her white father 's household , until his bankruptcy or death has her reduced to a menial position she may even be unaware of her status before being reduced to victimization . the first character of this type was the heroine of lydia maria child 's " the quadroons " ( 1842 ) , a short story . this character allowed abolitionists to draw attention to the sexual exploitation in slavery and , unlike portrayals of the suffering of the field hands , did not allow slaveholders to retort that the sufferings of northern mill hands were no easier . the northern mill owner would not sell his own children into slavery .
187th street intersects with , from east to west , laurel hill terrace , amsterdam avenue , audubon avenue , st. nicholas avenue , wadsworth avenue , broadway , bennett avenue , overlook terrace , fort washington avenue , pinehurst avenue , cabrini boulevard and chittenden avenue .
the relative reactivity of zinc and its ability to attract oxidation to itself makes it an efficient sacrificial anode in cathodic protection ( cp ) . for example , cathodic protection of a buried pipeline can be achieved by connecting anodes made from zinc to the pipe . zinc acts as the anode ( negative terminus ) by slowly corroding away as it passes electric current to the steel pipeline . [ note 2 ] zinc is also used to cathodically protect metals that are exposed to sea water from corrosion . a zinc disc attached to a ship 's iron rudder will slowly corrode , whereas the rudder stays unattacked . other similar uses include a plug of zinc attached to a propeller or the metal protective guard for the keel of the ship .
another body established under the good friday agreement , the british-irish council , is made up of all of the states and territories of the british isles . the british-irish parliamentary assembly ( irish : tionol pharlaiminteach na breataine agus na heireann ) predates the british-irish council and was established in 1990 . originally it comprised 25 members of the oireachtas , the irish parliament , and 25 members of the parliament of the united kingdom , with the purpose of building mutual understanding between members of both legislatures . since then the role and scope of the body has been expanded to include representatives from the scottish parliament , the national assembly for wales , the northern ireland assembly , the states of jersey , the states of guernsey and the high court of tynwald ( isle of man ) .
between 1925 and 1940 , philanthropic foundations , especially ones connected with the rockefellers , contributed about $ 7 million to support the yale institute of human relations and the affiliated yerkes laboratories of primate biology . the money went toward behavioral science research , which was supported by foundation officers who aimed to " improve mankind " under an informal , loosely defined human engineering effort . the behavioral scientists at yale , led by president james r. angell and psychobiologist robert m. yerkes , tapped into foundation largesse by crafting research programs aimed to investigate , then suggest , ways to control , sexual and social behavior . for example , yerkes analyzed chimpanzee sexual behavior in hopes of illuminating the evolutionary underpinnings of human development and providing information that could ameliorate dysfunction . ultimately , the behavioral-science results disappointed foundation officers , who shifted their human-engineering funds toward biological sciences .
as briefly discussed in unicode technical note # 26 , " in terms of implementation issues , any attempt at a unification of latin , greek , and cyrillic would wreak havoc [ and ] make casing operations an unholy mess , in effect making all casing operations context sensitive [ ... ] . " in other words , while the shapes of letters like a , b , e , h , k , m , o , p , t , x , y and so on are shared between the latin , greek , and cyrillic alphabets ( and small differences in their canonical forms may be considered to be of a merely typographical nature ) , it would still be problematic for a multilingual character set or a font to provide only a single codepoint for , say , uppercase letter b , as this would make it quite difficult for a wordprocessor to change that single uppercase letter to one of the three different choices for the lower-case letter , b ( latin ) , β ( greek ) , or в ( cyrillic ) . without letter case , a " unified european alphabet " - such as abбcгdδεzєзfφghiиj ... z , with an appropriate subset for each language - is feasible ; but considering letter case , it becomes very clear that these alphabets are rather distinct sets of symbols .
in 1966 , yale began discussions with its sister school vassar college about merging to foster coeducation at the undergraduate level . vassar , then all-female and part of the seven sisters - elite higher education schools that historically served as sister institutions to the ivy league when the ivy league still only admitted men - tentatively accepted , but then declined the invitation . both schools introduced coeducation independently in 1969 . amy solomon was the first woman to register as a yale undergraduate ; she was also the first woman at yale to join an undergraduate society , st. anthony hall . the undergraduate class of 1973 was the first class to have women starting from freshman year ; at the time , all undergraduate women were housed in vanderbilt hall at the south end of old campus .

most of the subcontinent was conquered by the maurya empire during the 4th and 3rd centuries bce . from the 3rd century bc onwards prakrit and pali literature in the north and the sangam literature in southern india started to flourish . wootz steel originated in south india in the 3rd century bc and was exported to foreign countries . various parts of india were ruled by numerous dynasties for the next 1,500 years , among which the gupta empire stands out . this period , witnessing a hindu religious and intellectual resurgence , is known as the classical or " golden age of india . " during this period , aspects of indian civilization , administration , culture , and religion ( hinduism and buddhism ) spread to much of asia , while kingdoms in southern india had maritime business links with the roman empire from around 77 ce . indian cultural influence spread over many parts of southeast asia which led to the establishment of indianized kingdoms in southeast asia ( greater india ) .
most feature movies shown during the prime time and early overnight hours ( 8 : 00 p.m. to 2 : 30 a.m. eastern time ) are presented by film historian robert osborne ( who has been with the network since its 1994 launch , except for a five-month medical leave from july to december 2011 , when guest hosts presented each night 's films ) on sunday through wednesday evenings - with osborne only presenting primetime films on weekends - and ben mankiewicz presenting only late evening films on thursdays , and the " silent sunday nights " and " tcm imports " blocks on sundays .
the term biological diversity was used first by wildlife scientist and conservationist raymond f. dasmann in the year 1968 lay book a different kind of country advocating conservation . the term was widely adopted only after more than a decade , when in the 1980s it came into common usage in science and environmental policy . thomas lovejoy , in the foreword to the book conservation biology , introduced the term to the scientific community . until then the term " natural diversity " was common , introduced by the science division of the nature conservancy in an important 1975 study , " the preservation of natural diversity . " by the early 1980s tnc 's science program and its head , robert e. jenkins , lovejoy and other leading conservation scientists at the time in america advocated the use of the term " biological diversity .

perhaps the most prominent , controversial and far-reaching theory in all of science has been the theory of evolution by natural selection put forward by the british naturalist charles darwin in his book on the origin of species in 1859 . darwin proposed that the features of all living things , including humans , were shaped by natural processes over long periods of time . the theory of evolution in its current form affects almost all areas of biology . implications of evolution on fields outside of pure science have led to both opposition and support from different parts of society , and profoundly influenced the popular understanding of " man 's place in the universe . " in the early 20th century , the study of heredity became a major investigation after the rediscovery in 1900 of the laws of inheritance developed by the moravian monk gregor mendel in 1866 . mendel 's laws provided the beginnings of the study of genetics , which became a major field of research for both scientific and industrial research . by 1953 , james d. watson , francis crick and maurice wilkins clarified the basic structure of dna , the genetic material for expressing life in all its forms . in the late 20th century , the possibilities of genetic engineering became practical for the first time , and a massive international effort began in 1990 to map out an entire human genome ( the human genome project ) .
during a deposition filed for the 1887 trial , italian inventor antonio meucci also claimed to have created the first working model of a telephone in italy in 1834 . in 1886 , in the first of three cases in which he was involved , meucci took the stand as a witness in the hopes of establishing his invention 's priority . meucci 's evidence in this case was disputed due to a lack of material evidence for his inventions as his working models were purportedly lost at the laboratory of american district telegraph ( adt ) of new york , which was later incorporated as a subsidiary of western union in 1901 . meucci 's work , like many other inventors of the period , was based on earlier acoustic principles and despite evidence of earlier experiments , the final case involving meucci was eventually dropped upon meucci 's death . however , due to the efforts of congressman vito fossella , the u.s. house of representatives on june 11 , 2002 stated that meucci 's " work in the invention of the telephone should be acknowledged , " even though this did not put an end to a still contentious issue . [ n 17 ] some modern scholars do not agree with the claims that bell 's work on the telephone was influenced by meucci 's inventions . [ n 18 ]
ongoing political tensions between great britain and the thirteen colonies reached a crisis in 1774 when the british placed the province of massachusetts under martial law after the patriots protested taxes they regarded as a violation of their constitutional rights as englishmen . when shooting began at lexington and concord in april 1775 , militia units from across new england rushed to boston and bottled up the british in the city . the continental congress appointed george washington as commander-in-chief of the newly created continental army , which was augmented throughout the war by colonial militia . he drove the british out of boston but in late summer 1776 they returned to new york and nearly captured washington 's army . meanwhile , the revolutionaries expelled british officials from the 13 states , and declared themselves an independent nation on july 4 , 1776 .
conventional bleaching of wood pulp using elemental chlorine produces and releases into the environment large amounts of chlorinated organic compounds , including chlorinated dioxins . dioxins are recognized as a persistent environmental pollutant , regulated internationally by the stockholm convention on persistent organic pollutants . dioxins are highly toxic , and health effects on humans include reproductive , developmental , immune and hormonal problems . they are known to be carcinogenic . over 90 % of human exposure is through food , primarily meat , dairy , fish and shellfish , as dioxins accumulate in the food chain in the fatty tissue of animals .
the 1973 oil embargo and 1979 energy crisis caused a reorganization of energy policies around the world and brought renewed attention to developing solar technologies . deployment strategies focused on incentive programs such as the federal photovoltaic utilization program in the us and the sunshine program in japan . other efforts included the formation of research facilities in the us ( seri , now nrel ) , japan ( nedo ) , and germany ( fraunhofer institute for solar energy systems ise ) .
in the early 20th century , carl von voit and max rubner independently measured caloric energy expenditure in different species of animals , applying principles of physics in nutrition . in 1906 , edith g. willcock and frederick hopkins showed that the amino acid tryptophan aids the well-being of mice but it did not assure their growth . in the middle of twelve years of attempts to isolate them , hopkins said in a 1906 lecture that " unsuspected dietetic factors , " other than calories , protein , and minerals , are needed to prevent deficiency diseases . in 1907 , stephen m. babcock and edwin b. hart conducted the single-grain experiment , which took nearly four years to complete .
in developing countries , with high poverty and poor schooling opportunities , child labour is still prevalent . in 2010 , sub-saharan africa had the highest incidence rates of child labour , with several african nations witnessing over 50 percent of children aged 5-14 working . worldwide agriculture is the largest employer of child labour . vast majority of child labour is found in rural settings and informal urban economy ; children are predominantly employed by their parents , rather than factories . poverty and lack of schools are considered as the primary cause of child labour .
the flower may consist only of these parts , as in willow , where each flower comprises only a few stamens or two carpels . usually , other structures are present and serve to protect the sporophylls and to form an envelope attractive to pollinators . the individual members of these surrounding structures are known as sepals and petals ( or tepals in flowers such as magnolia where sepals and petals are not distinguishable from each other ) . the outer series ( calyx of sepals ) is usually green and leaf-like , and functions to protect the rest of the flower , especially the bud . the inner series ( corolla of petals ) is , in general , white or brightly colored , and is more delicate in structure . it functions to attract insect or bird pollinators . attraction is effected by color , scent , and nectar , which may be secreted in some part of the flower . the characteristics that attract pollinators account for the popularity of flowers and flowering plants among humans .
another common application is the control of the throttle of an internal combustion engine in conjunction with an electronic governor . in this usage , the motor works against a return spring to move the throttle in accordance with the output of the governor . the latter monitors engine speed by counting electrical pulses from the ignition system or from a magnetic pickup and , depending on the speed , makes small adjustments to the amount of current applied to the motor . if the engine starts to slow down relative to the desired speed , the current will be increased , the motor will develop more torque , pulling against the return spring and opening the throttle . should the engine run too fast , the governor will reduce the current being applied to the motor , causing the return spring to pull back and close the throttle .
the lutherans were the first protestant church offering a dialogue to the catholic church in september 1964 in reykjavik , iceland . it resulted in joint study groups of several issues . the dialogue with the methodist church began october 1965 , after its representatives officially applauded remarkable changes , friendship and cooperation of the past five years . the reformed churches entered four years later into a dialogue with the catholic church . the president of the lutheran world federation and member of the central committee of the world council of churches fredrik a. schiotz stated during the 450th anniversary of the reformation , that earlier commemorations were viewed almost as a triumph . reformation should be celebrated as a thanksgiving to god , his truth and his renewed life . he welcomed the announcement of pope paul vi to celebrate the 1900th anniversary of the death of the apostle peter and apostle paul , and promised the participation and cooperation in the festivities .
from 1820 to 1848 sicily was shaken by upheavals , which culminated on 12 january 1848 , with a popular insurrection , the first one in europe that year , led by giuseppe la masa . a parliament and constitution were proclaimed . the first president was ruggero settimo . the bourbons reconquered palermo in 1849 , and remained under their rule until the time of giuseppe garibaldi . the famous general entered palermo with his troops ( the " thousands " ) on 27 may 1860 . after the plebiscite later that year palermo , along with the rest of sicily , became part of the new kingdom of italy ( 1861 ) .
saint helena produces what is said to be the most expensive coffee in the world . it also produces and exports tungi spirit , made from the fruit of the prickly or cactus pears , opuntia ficus-indica ( " tungi " is the local st helenian name for the plant ) . ascension island , tristan da cunha and saint helena all issue their own postage stamps which provide a significant income .
season ten is the first to include online auditions where contestants could submit a 40-second video audition via myspace . karen rodriguez was one such auditioner and reached the final rounds .
marvin gardens , the leading yellow property on the board shown , is actually a misspelling of the original location name , " marven gardens . " the misspelling was said to have been introduced by charles todd and passed on when his home-made monopoly board was copied by charles darrow and thence parker brothers . it was not until 1995 that parker brothers acknowledged this mistake and formally apologized to the residents of marven gardens for the misspelling although the spelling error was not corrected .
during the summers at nohant , particularly in the years 1839-43 , chopin found quiet , productive days during which he composed many works , including his polonaise in a-flat major , op. 53 . among the visitors to nohant were delacroix and the mezzo-soprano pauline viardot , whom chopin had advised on piano technique and composition . delacroix gives an account of staying at nohant in a letter of 7 june 1842 :
near new haven there is the static inverter plant of the hvdc cross sound cable . there are three purecell model 400 fuel cells placed in the city of new haven - one at the new haven public schools and newly constructed roberto clemente school , one at the mixed-use 360 state street building , and one at city hall . according to giovanni zinn of the city 's office of sustainability , each fuel cell may save the city up to $ 1 million in energy costs over a decade . the fuel cells were provided by clearedge power , formerly utc power .
typically the sub-tropical high pressure belt , with frequent clear skies , provides more than 300 days of sunshine per year . it is situated at the southern edge of the tropics ; the tropic of capricorn cuts the country about in half . the winter ( june - august ) is generally dry , both rainy seasons occur in summer , the small rainy season between september and november , the big one between february and april . humidity is low , and average rainfall varies from almost zero in the coastal desert to more than 600 mm in the caprivi strip . rainfall is however highly variable , and droughts are common . the last [ update ] bad rainy season with rainfall far below the annual average occurred in summer 2006 / 07 .
renewable energy technologies are getting cheaper , through technological change and through the benefits of mass production and market competition . a 2011 iea report said : " a portfolio of renewable energy technologies is becoming cost-competitive in an increasingly broad range of circumstances , in some cases providing investment opportunities without the need for specific economic support , " and added that " cost reductions in critical technologies , such as wind and solar , are set to continue . " as of 2011 [ update ] , there have been substantial reductions in the cost of solar and wind technologies :
there are several major exceptions on tuition fees . in many european countries , it is possible to study without tuition fees . public universities in nordic countries were entirely without tuition fees until around 2005 . denmark , sweden and finland then moved to put in place tuition fees for foreign students . citizens of eu and eea member states and citizens from switzerland remain exempted from tuition fees , and the amounts of public grants granted to promising foreign students were increased to offset some of the impact .
the thuringian realm existed until 531 and later , the landgraviate of thuringia was the largest state in the region , persisting between 1131 and 1247 . afterwards there was no state named thuringia , nevertheless the term commonly described the region between the harz mountains in the north , the weiße elster river in the east , the franconian forest in the south and the werra river in the west . after the treaty of leipzig , thuringia had its own dynasty again , the ernestine wettins . their various lands formed the free state of thuringia , founded in 1920 , together with some other small principalities . the prussian territories around erfurt , muhlhausen and nordhausen joined thuringia in 1945 .
the international association for the study of pain advocates that the relief of pain should be recognized as a human right , that chronic pain should be considered a disease in its own right , and that pain medicine should have the full status of a specialty . it is a specialty only in china and australia at this time . elsewhere , pain medicine is a subspecialty under disciplines such as anesthesiology , physiatry , neurology , palliative medicine and psychiatry . in 2011 , human rights watch alerted that tens of millions of people worldwide are still denied access to inexpensive medications for severe pain .
plumage is regularly moulted ; the standard plumage of a bird that has moulted after breeding is known as the " non-breeding " plumage , or - in the humphrey-parkes terminology - " basic " plumage ; breeding plumages or variations of the basic plumage are known under the humphrey-parkes system as " alternate " plumages . moulting is annual in most species , although some may have two moults a year , and large birds of prey may moult only once every few years . moulting patterns vary across species . in passerines , flight feathers are replaced one at a time with the innermost primary being the first . when the fifth of sixth primary is replaced , the outermost tertiaries begin to drop . after the innermost tertiaries are moulted , the secondaries starting from the innermost begin to drop and this proceeds to the outer feathers ( centrifugal moult ) . the greater primary coverts are moulted in synchrony with the primary that they overlap . a small number of species , such as ducks and geese , lose all of their flight feathers at once , temporarily becoming flightless . as a general rule , the tail feathers are moulted and replaced starting with the innermost pair . centripetal moults of tail feathers are however seen in the phasianidae . the centrifugal moult is modified in the tail feathers of woodpeckers and treecreepers , in that it begins with the second innermost pair of feathers and finishes with the central pair of feathers so that the bird maintains a functional climbing tail . the general pattern seen in passerines is that the primaries are replaced outward , secondaries inward , and the tail from center outward . before nesting , the females of most bird species gain a bare brood patch by losing feathers close to the belly . the skin there is well supplied with blood vessels and helps the bird in incubation .
nanjing borders yangzhou to the northeast , one town downstream when following the north bank of the yangtze , zhenjiang to the east , one town downstream when following the south bank of the yangtze , and changzhou to the southeast . on its western boundary is anhui province , where nanjing borders five prefecture-level cities , chuzhou to the northwest , wuhu , chaohu and maanshan to the west and xuancheng to the southwest .
the dominance of american idol in the ratings had made it the most profitable show in u.s. tv for many years . the show was estimated to generate $ 900 million for the year 2004 through sales of tv ads , albums , merchandise and concert tickets . by season seven , the show was estimated to earn around $ 900 million from its ad revenue alone , not including ancillary sponsorship deals and other income . one estimate puts the total tv revenue for the first eight seasons of american at $ 6.4 billion . sponsors that bought fully integrated packages can expect a variety of promotions of their products on the show , such as product placement , adverts and product promotion integrated into the show , and various promotional opportunities . other off-air promotional partners pay for the rights to feature " idol " branding on their packaging , products and marketing programs . american idol also partnered with disney in its theme park attraction the american idol experience .
shortly after the end of the war in may 1945 , germans who had fled in early 1945 tried to return to their homes in east prussia . an estimated number of 800,000 germans were living in east prussia during the summer of 1945 . many more were prevented from returning , [ citation needed ] and the german population of east prussia was almost completely expelled by the communist regimes . during the war and for some time thereafter 45 camps were established for about 200,000-250,000 forced labourers , the vast majority of whom were deported to the soviet union , including the gulag camp system . the largest camp with about 48,000 inmates was established at deutsch eylau ( iława ) . orphaned children who were left behind in the zone occupied by the soviet union were referred to as wolf children .
on 26 july 2012 , to coincide with the official start of the london 2012 olympics and the issuing of a series of souvenir front covers , the times added the suffix " of london " to its masthead .
the australian government controls the exclusive economic zone ( eez ) and revenue from it extending 200 nautical miles ( 370 km ) around norfolk island ( roughly 428,000km2 ) and territorial sea claims to three nautical miles ( 6 km ) from the island . there is a strong belief on the island that some of the revenue generated from norfolk 's eez should be available to providing services such as health and infrastructure on the island , which the island has been responsible for , similar to how the northern territory is able to access revenue from their mineral resources . the exclusive economic zone provides the islanders with fish , its only major natural resource . norfolk island has no direct control over any marine areas but has an agreement with the commonwealth through the australian fisheries management authority ( afma ) to fish " recreationally " in a small section of the eez known locally as " the box . " while there is speculation that the zone may include oil and gas deposits , this is not proven . there are no major arable lands or permanent farmlands , though about 25 per cent of the island is a permanent pasture . there is no irrigated land . the island uses the australian dollar as its currency .
the church of the holy apostles in thessaloniki was built in 1310-14 . although some vandal systematically removed the gold tesserae of the background it can be seen that the pantokrator and the prophets in the dome follow the traditional byzantine pattern . many details are similar to the pammakaristos mosaics so it is supposed that the same team of mosaicists worked in both buildings . another building with a related mosaic decoration is the theotokos paregoritissa church in arta . the church was established by the despot of epirus in 1294-96 . in the dome is the traditional stern pantokrator , with prophets and cherubim below .
genocide has become an official term used in international relations . the word genocide was not in use before 1944 . before this , in 1941 , winston churchill described the mass killing of russian prisoners of war and civilians as " a crime without a name . " in that year , a polish-jewish lawyer named raphael lemkin , described the policies of systematic murder founded by the nazis as genocide . the word genocide is the combination of the greek prefix geno- ( meaning tribe or race ) and caedere ( the latin word for to kill ) . the word is defined as a specific set of violent crimes that are committed against a certain group with the attempt to remove the entire group from existence or to destroy them .
albert einstein proposed that the laws of physics should be based on the principle of relativity . this principle holds that the rules of physics must be the same for all observers , regardless of the frame of reference that is used , and that light propagates at the same speed in all reference frames . this theory was motivated by maxwell 's equations , which show that electromagnetic waves propagate in a vacuum at the speed of light . however , maxwell 's equations give no indication of what this speed is relative to . prior to einstein , it was thought that this speed was relative to a fixed medium , called the luminiferous ether . in contrast , the theory of special relativity postulates that light propagates at the speed of light in all inertial frames , and examines the implications of this postulate .
note that the polish landed gentry ( ziemianie or ziemianstwo ) was composed of any nobility that owned lands : thus of course the magnates , the middle nobility and that lesser nobility that had at least part of the village . as manorial lordships were also opened to burgesses of certain privileged royal cities , not all landed gentry had a hereditary title of nobility .
due to geographical proximity of the central american countries to the u.s. which has powerful military , economic , and political influences , there were several movements and proposals by the united states during the 19th and 20th centuries to annex some or all of the central american republics ( costa rica , el salvador , guatemala , honduras with the formerly british-ruled bay islands , nicaragua , panama which had the u.s.-ruled canal zone territory from 1903 to 1979 , and formerly british honduras or belize since 1981 ) . however , the u.s. never acted on these proposals from some u.s. politicians ; some of which were never delivered or considered seriously . in 2001 , el salvador adopted the u.s. dollar as its currency , while panama has used it for decades due to its ties to the canal zone .
the area now known as tennessee was first inhabited by paleo-indians nearly 12,000 years ago . the names of the cultural groups that inhabited the area between first settlement and the time of european contact are unknown , but several distinct cultural phases have been named by archaeologists , including archaic ( 8000-1000 bc ) , woodland ( 1000 bc-1000 ad ) , and mississippian ( 1000-1600 ad ) , whose chiefdoms were the cultural predecessors of the muscogee people who inhabited the tennessee river valley before cherokee migration into the river 's headwaters .
in 121 bc , han forces expelled the xiongnu from a vast territory spanning the hexi corridor to lop nur . they repelled a joint xiongnu-qiang invasion of this northwestern territory in 111 bc . in that year , the han court established four new frontier commanderies in this region : jiuquan , zhangyi , dunhuang , and wuwei . the majority of people on the frontier were soldiers . on occasion , the court forcibly moved peasant farmers to new frontier settlements , along with government-owned slaves and convicts who performed hard labor . the court also encouraged commoners , such as farmers , merchants , landowners , and hired laborers , to voluntarily migrate to the frontier .
one of albert 's greatest contributions was his study of dionysus the areopagite , a mystical theologian whose words left an indelible imprint in the medieval period . magnus ' writings made a significant contribution to german mysticism , which became vibrant in the minds of the beguines and women such as hildegard of bingen and mechthild of magdeburg . mysticism , for the purposes of this study , refers to the conviction that all believers have the capability to experience god 's love . this love may manifest itself through brief ecstatic experiences , such that one may be engulfed by god and gain an immediate knowledge of him , which is unknowable through the intellect alone .
antarctica , on average , is the coldest , driest , and windiest continent , and has the highest average elevation of all the continents . antarctica is considered a desert , with annual precipitation of only 200 mm ( 8 in ) along the coast and far less inland . the temperature in antarctica has reached − 89.2 ° c ( − 128.6 ° f ) , though the average for the third quarter ( the coldest part of the year ) is − 63 ° c ( − 81 ° f ) . there are no permanent human residents , but anywhere from 1,000 to 5,000 people reside throughout the year at the research stations scattered across the continent . organisms native to antarctica include many types of algae , bacteria , fungi , plants , protista , and certain animals , such as mites , nematodes , penguins , seals and tardigrades . vegetation , where it occurs , is tundra .
the royal college of chemistry was established by private subscription in 1845 as there was a growing awareness that practical aspects of the experimental sciences were not well taught and that in the united kingdom the teaching of chemistry in particular had fallen behind that in germany . as a result of a movement earlier in the decade , many politicians donated funds to establish the college , including benjamin disraeli , william gladstone and robert peel . it was also supported by prince albert , who persuaded august wilhelm von hofmann to be the first professor .
a police force is a constituted body of persons empowered by the state to enforce the law , protect property , and limit civil disorder . their powers include the legitimized use of force . the term is most commonly associated with police services of a sovereign state that are authorized to exercise the police power of that state within a defined legal or territorial area of responsibility . police forces are often defined as being separate from military or other organizations involved in the defense of the state against foreign aggressors ; however , gendarmerie are military units charged with civil policing .
in the early hours of 7 december ( hawaiian time ) , japan launched a major surprise carrier-based air strike on pearl harbor without explicit warning , which crippled the u.s. pacific fleet , leaving eight american battleships out of action , 188 american aircraft destroyed , and 2,403 american citizens dead . at the time of the attack , the u.s. was not officially at war anywhere in the world , which means that the people killed or property destroyed at pearl harbor by the japanese attack had a non-combatant status . [ nb 11 ] the japanese had gambled that the united states , when faced with such a sudden and massive blow , would agree to a negotiated settlement and allow japan free rein in asia . this gamble did not pay off . american losses were less serious than initially thought : the american aircraft carriers , which would prove to be more important than battleships , were at sea , and vital naval infrastructure ( fuel oil tanks , shipyard facilities , and a power station ) , submarine base , and signals intelligence units were unscathed . japan 's fallback strategy , relying on a war of attrition to make the u.s. come to terms , was beyond the ijn 's capabilities .
in international law and international relations , a protocol is generally a treaty or international agreement that supplements a previous treaty or international agreement . a protocol can amend the previous treaty , or add additional provisions . parties to the earlier agreement are not required to adopt the protocol . sometimes this is made clearer by calling it an " optional protocol , " especially where many parties to the first agreement do not support the protocol .
the 19th-century liberal prime minister william ewart gladstone considered burke " a magazine of wisdom on ireland and america " and in his diary recorded : " made many extracts from burke - sometimes almost divine . " the radical mp and anti-corn law activist richard cobden often praised burke 's thoughts and details on scarcity . the liberal historian lord acton considered burke one of the three greatest liberals , along with william gladstone and thomas babington macaulay . lord macaulay recorded in his diary : " i have now finished reading again most of burke 's works . admirable ! the greatest man since milton . " the gladstonian liberal mp john morley published two books on burke ( including a biography ) and was influenced by burke , including his views on prejudice . the cobdenite radical francis hirst thought burke deserved " a place among english libertarians , even though of all lovers of liberty and of all reformers he was the most conservative , the least abstract , always anxious to preserve and renovate rather than to innovate . in politics he resembled the modern architect who would restore an old house instead of pulling it down to construct a new one on the site . " burke 's reflections on the revolution in france was controversial at the time of its publication , but after his death , it was to become his best known and most influential work , and a manifesto for conservative thinking .
a key component of the arousal system is the suprachiasmatic nucleus ( scn ) , a tiny part of the hypothalamus located directly above the point at which the optic nerves from the two eyes cross . the scn contains the body 's central biological clock . neurons there show activity levels that rise and fall with a period of about 24 hours , circadian rhythms : these activity fluctuations are driven by rhythmic changes in expression of a set of " clock genes . " the scn continues to keep time even if it is excised from the brain and placed in a dish of warm nutrient solution , but it ordinarily receives input from the optic nerves , through the retinohypothalamic tract ( rht ) , that allows daily light-dark cycles to calibrate the clock .
the major roles of construction and of services ( government , communications , banking and finance , food production , entertainment , and legal services ) in brasilia 's economy reflect the city 's status as a governmental rather than an industrial center . industries connected with construction , food processing , and furnishings are important , as are those associated with publishing , printing , and computer software . gdp is divided in public administration 54.8 % , services 28.7 % , industry 10.2 % , commerce 6.1 % , agribusiness 0.2 % .
times of personal significance have included the births and marriages of her children , grandchildren and great grandchildren , her coronation in 1953 , and the celebration of milestones such as her silver , golden and diamond jubilees in 1977 , 2002 , and 2012 , respectively . moments of sadness for her include the death of her father , aged 56 ; the assassination of prince philip 's uncle , lord mountbatten ; the breakdown of her children 's marriages in 1992 ( her annus horribilis ) ; the death in 1997 of her son 's former wife , diana , princess of wales ; and the deaths of her mother and sister in 2002 . elizabeth has occasionally faced republican sentiments and severe press criticism of the royal family , but support for the monarchy and her personal popularity remain high .
in 2010 , 6.9 % of the population ( 1,269,765 ) considered themselves to be of only american ancestry ( regardless of race or ethnicity ) . many of these were of english or scotch-irish descent ; however , their families have lived in the state for so long , that they choose to identify as having " american " ancestry or do not know their ancestry . in the 1980 united states census the largest ancestry group reported in florida was english with 2,232,514 floridians claiming that they were of english or mostly english american ancestry . some of their ancestry went back to the original thirteen colonies .
virgil is traditionally ranked as one of rome 's greatest poets . his aeneid has been considered the national epic of ancient rome from the time of its composition to the present day . modeled after homer 's iliad and odyssey , the aeneid follows the trojan refugee aeneas as he struggles to fulfill his destiny and arrive on the shores of italy - in roman mythology the founding act of rome . virgil 's work has had wide and deep influence on western literature , most notably dante 's divine comedy , in which virgil appears as dante 's guide through hell and purgatory .
in october 2009 , the mod was heavily criticized for withdrawing the bi-annual non-operational training £ 20m budget for the volunteer territorial army ( ta ) , ending all non-operational training for 6 months until april 2010 . the government eventually backed down and restored the funding . the ta provides a small percentage of the uk 's operational troops . its members train on weekly evenings and monthly weekends , as well as two-week exercises generally annually and occasionally bi-annually for troops doing other courses . the cuts would have meant a significant loss of personnel and would have had adverse effects on recruitment .
while the housing and credit bubbles were building , a series of factors caused the financial system to both expand and become increasingly fragile , a process called financialization . u.s. government policy from the 1970s onward has emphasized deregulation to encourage business , which resulted in less oversight of activities and less disclosure of information about new activities undertaken by banks and other evolving financial institutions . thus , policymakers did not immediately recognize the increasingly important role played by financial institutions such as investment banks and hedge funds , also known as the shadow banking system . some experts believe these institutions had become as important as commercial ( depository ) banks in providing credit to the u.s. economy , but they were not subject to the same regulations .
as of the census of 2010 , there were 520,116 people , 229,762 households , and 112,455 families residing in the city . the population density was 2,500.1 inhabitants per square mile ( 965.3 / km ² ) . there were 209,609 housing units at an average density of 1,076.7 per square mile ( 415.7 / km ² ) . the racial makeup of the city was 69.7 % white ( down from 94.8 % in 1970 ) , 5.0 % black or african-american , 2.7 % native american , 2.9 % asian , 0.2 % pacific islander , 16.9 % from other races , and 3.8 % from two or more races . hispanic or latino of any race were 41.6 % of the population . non-hispanic whites were 47.2 % of the population in 2010 , down from 72.8 % in 1970 .
the liberal political forces maintained strong control over the state government until shortly after the french intervention which turned the tables in favor to the conservative forces once again . the intervention had serious repercussions for the state of chihuahua . president juarez , in an effort to organize a strong defense against the french , decreed a list of national guard units that every state had to contribute to the ministry of war and the navy ; chihuahua was responsible for inducting 2,000 men . regaining power , governor luis terrazas assigned the first battalion of chihuahua for integration into the national army led by general jesus gonzalez ortega ; the battalion was deployed to puebla . after the defeat of the army in puebla , the juarez administration was forced to abandon mexico city ; the president retreated further north seeking refuge in the state of chihuahua .
on june 21 , 1880 , bell 's assistant transmitted a wireless voice telephone message a considerable distance , from the roof of the franklin school in washington , d.c. , to bell at the window of his laboratory , some 213 metres ( 700 ft ) away , 19 years before the first voice radio transmissions .
on 1 february 1908 , the king dom carlos i of portugal and his heir apparent , prince royal dom luis filipe , duke of braganza , were murdered in lisbon . under his rule , portugal had twice been declared bankrupt - on 14 june 1892 , and again on 10 may 1902 - causing social turmoil , economic disturbances , protests , revolts and criticism of the monarchy . manuel ii of portugal became the new king , but was eventually overthrown by the 5 october 1910 revolution , which abolished the regime and instated republicanism in portugal . political instability and economic weaknesses were fertile ground for chaos and unrest during the portuguese first republic . these conditions would lead to the failed monarchy of the north , 28 may 1926 coup d 'etat , and the creation of the national dictatorship ( ditadura nacional ) .
in april 2009 , the united states supreme court agreed to hear a suit over reverse discrimination brought by 20 white and hispanic firefighters against the city . the suit involved the 2003 promotion test for the new haven fire department . after the tests were scored , no blacks scored high enough to qualify for consideration for promotion , so the city announced that no one would be promoted . on 29 june 2009 , the united states supreme court ruled in favor of the firefighters , agreeing that they were improperly denied promotion because of their race . the case , ricci v. destefano , became highly publicized and brought national attention to new haven politics due to the involvement of then-supreme court nominee ( and yale law school graduate ) sonia sotomayor in a lower court decision .
archaeologist louis binford criticised the idea that early hominids and early humans were hunters . on the basis of the analysis of the skeletal remains of the consumed animals , he concluded that hominids and early humans were mostly scavengers , not hunters , and this idea is popular among some archaeologists and paleoanthropologists . robert blumenschine proposed the idea of confrontational scavenging , which involves challenging and scaring off other predators after they have made a kill , which he suggests could have been the leading method of obtaining protein-rich meat by early humans .
on may 16 china stated it had also received $ 457 million in donated money and goods for rescue efforts so far , including $ 83 million from 19 countries and four international organizations . saudi arabia was the largest aid donor to china , providing close to € 40,000,000 in financial assistance , and an additional € 8,000,000 worth of relief materials .
until the 19th century , religion played a significant role in university curriculum ; however , the role of religion in research universities decreased in the 19th century , and by the end of the 19th century , the german university model had spread around the world . universities concentrated on science in the 19th and 20th centuries and became increasingly accessible to the masses . in britain , the move from industrial revolution to modernity saw the arrival of new civic universities with an emphasis on science and engineering , a movement initiated in 1960 by sir keith murray ( chairman of the university grants committee ) and sir samuel curran , with the formation of the university of strathclyde . the british also established universities worldwide , and higher education became available to the masses not only in europe .
richmond is also fast-becoming known for its food scene , with several restaurants in the fan , church hill , jackson ward and elsewhere around the city generating regional and national attention for their fare . departures magazine named richmond " the next great american food city " in august 2014 . also in 2014 , southern living magazine named three richmond restaurants - comfort , heritage and the roosevelt - among its " 100 best restaurants in the south , " while metzger bar & butchery made its " best new restaurants : 12 to watch " list . craft beer and liquor production is also growing in the river city , with twelve micro-breweries in city proper ; the oldest is legend brewery , founded in 1994 . three distilleries , reservoir distillery , belle isle craft spirits and james river distillery , were established in 2010 , 2013 and 2014 , respectively .
in 2004 , worldwide sales of audio cds , cd-roms and cd-rs reached about 30 billion discs . by 2007 , 200 billion cds had been sold worldwide . cds are increasingly being replaced by other forms of digital storage and distribution , with the result that audio cd sales rates in the u.s. have dropped about 50 % from their peak ; however , they remain one of the primary distribution methods for the music industry . in 2014 , revenues from digital music services matched those from physical format sales for the first time .
shiraz , with a population of around 1.4 million ( 2011 census ) , is the sixth major city of iran . it is the capital of fars province , and was also a former capital of iran . the area was greatly influenced by the babylonian civilization , and after the emergence of the ancient persians , soon came to be known as persis . persians were present in the region since the 9th century bc , and became rulers of a large empire under the reign of the achaemenid dynasty in the 6th century bc . the ruins of persepolis and pasargadae , two of the four capitals of the achaemenid empire , are located around the modern-day city of shiraz .
philadelphia 's an annualized unemployment rate was 7.8 % in 2014 , down from 10.0 % the previous year . this is higher than the national average of 6.2 % . similarly , the rate of new jobs added to the city 's economy lagged behind the national job growth . in 2014 , about 8,800 jobs were added to the city 's economy . sectors with the largest number of jobs added were in education and health services , leisure and hospitality , and professional and business services . declines were seen in the city 's manufacturing and government sectors .
in the 1950s after prc was established by cpc , the government invested heavily in the city to build a series of state-owned heavy industries , as part of the national plan of rapid industrialization , converting it into a heavy industry production centre of east china . overenthusiastic in building a " world-class " industrial city , the government also made many disastrous mistakes during development , such as spending hundreds of millions of yuan to mine for non-existent coal , resulting in negative economic growth in the late 1960s . from 1960s to 1980s there were five pillar industries , namely , electronics , cars , petrochemical , iron and steel , and power , each with big state-owned firms . after the reform and opening recovering market economy , the state-owned enterprises found themselves incapable of competing with efficient multinational firms and local private firms , hence were either mired in heavy debt or forced into bankruptcy or privatization and this resulted in large numbers of layoff workers who were technically not unemployed but effectively jobless .
the bbc 's highlights package on saturday and sunday nights , as well as other evenings when fixtures justify , will run until 2016 . television rights alone for the period 2010 to 2013 have been purchased for £ 1.782 billion . on 22 june 2009 , due to troubles encountered by setanta sports after it failed to meet a final deadline over a £ 30 million payment to the premier league , espn was awarded two packages of uk rights containing a total of 46 matches that were available for the 2009-10 season as well as a package of 23 matches per season from 2010-11 to 2012-13 . on 13 june 2012 , the premier league announced that bt had been awarded 38 games a season for the 2013-14 through 2015-16 seasons at £ 246 million-a-year . the remaining 116 games were retained by sky who paid £ 760 million-a-year . the total domestic rights have raised £ 3.018 billion , an increase of 70.2 % over the 2010-11 to 2012-13 rights . the value of the licensing deal rose by another 70.2 % in 2015 , when sky and bt paid a total of £ 5.136 billion to renew their contracts with the premier league for another three years up to the 2018-19 season .
roofing shingles account for most of the remaining asphalt / bitumen consumption . other uses include cattle sprays , fence-post treatments , and waterproofing for fabrics . asphalt / bitumen is used to make japan black , a lacquer known especially for its use on iron and steel , and it is also used in paint and marker inks by some graffiti supply companies to increase the weather resistance and permanence of the paint or ink , and to make the color much darker . [ citation needed ] asphalt / bitumen is also used to seal some alkaline batteries during the manufacturing process .
war work again brought local prosperity during world war ii , this time centered on boeing aircraft . the war dispersed the city 's numerous japanese-american businessmen due to the japanese american internment . after the war , the local economy dipped . it rose again with boeing 's growing dominance in the commercial airliner market . seattle celebrated its restored prosperity and made a bid for world recognition with the century 21 exposition , the 1962 world 's fair . another major local economic downturn was in the late 1960s and early 1970s , at a time when boeing was heavily affected by the oil crises , loss of government contracts , and costs and delays associated with the boeing 747 . many people left the area to look for work elsewhere , and two local real estate agents put up a billboard reading " will the last person leaving seattle - turn out the lights . "

[ citation needed ] rajasthan 's jaipur jantar mantar , mehrangarh fort and stepwell of jodhpur , dilwara temples , chittorgarh fort , lake palace , miniature paintings in bundi , and numerous city palaces and haveli 's are part of the architectural heritage of india . jaipur , the pink city , is noted for the ancient houses made of a type of sandstone dominated by a pink hue . in jodhpur , maximum houses are painted blue . at ajmer , there is white marble bara-dari on the anasagar lake . jain temples dot rajasthan from north to south and east to west . dilwara temples of mount abu , ranakpur temple dedicated to lord adinath in pali district , jain temples in the fort complexes of chittor , jaisalmer and kumbhalgarh , lodurva jain temples , mirpur jain temple , sarun mata temple kotputli , bhandasar and karni mata temple of bikaner and mandore of jodhpur are some of the best examples .
when a historic document survives only in translation , the original having been lost , researchers sometimes undertake back-translation in an effort to reconstruct the original text . an example involves the novel the saragossa manuscript by the polish aristocrat jan potocki ( 1761-1815 ) , who wrote the novel in french and anonymously published fragments in 1804 and 1813-14 . portions of the original french-language manuscript were subsequently lost ; however , the missing fragments survived in a polish translation that was made by edmund chojecki in 1847 from a complete french copy , now lost . french-language versions of the complete saragossa manuscript have since been produced , based on extant french-language fragments and on french-language versions that have been back-translated from chojecki 's polish version .
many historical linguists view any speech form as a dialect of the older medium of communication from which it developed . [ citation needed ] this point of view sees the modern romance languages as dialects of latin , modern greek as a dialect of ancient greek , tok pisin as a dialect of english , and north germanic as dialects of old norse . this paradigm is not entirely problem-free . it sees genetic relationships as paramount : the " dialects " of a " language " ( which itself may be a " dialect " of a yet older language ) may or may not be mutually intelligible . moreover , a parent language may spawn several " dialects " which themselves subdivide any number of times , with some " branches " of the tree changing more rapidly than others .
during the reign of mithridates i of parthia , arsacid control expanded to include herat ( in 167 bc ) , babylonia ( in 144 bc ) , media ( in 141 bc ) , persia ( in 139 bc ) , and large parts of syria ( in the 110s bc ) . the seleucid-parthian wars continued as the seleucids invaded mesopotamia under antiochus vii sidetes ( r . 138-129 bc ) , but he was eventually killed by a parthian counterattack . after the fall of the seleucid dynasty , the parthians fought frequently against neighbouring rome in the roman-parthian wars ( 66 bc - 217 ad ) . abundant traces of hellenism continued under the parthian empire . the parthians used greek as well as their own parthian language ( though lesser than greek ) as languages of administration and also used greek drachmas as coinage . they enjoyed greek theater and greek art influenced parthian art . the parthians continued worhipping greek gods syncretized together with iranian deities . their rulers established ruler cults in the manner of hellenistic kings and often used hellenistic royal epithets .
most of the alsatian population is roman catholic , but , largely because of the region 's german heritage , a significant protestant community also exists : today , the epcaal ( a lutheran church ) is france 's second largest protestant church , also forming an administrative union ( uepal ) with the much smaller calvinist epral . unlike the rest of france , the local law in alsace-moselle still provides for to the napoleonic concordat of 1801 and the organic articles , which provides public subsidies to the roman catholic , lutheran , and calvinist churches , as well as to jewish synagogues ; religion classes in one of these faiths is compulsory in public schools . this divergence in policy from the french majority is due to the region having been part of imperial germany when the 1905 law separating the french church and state was instituted ( for a more comprehensive history , see : alsace-lorraine ) . controversy erupts periodically on the appropriateness of this legal disposition , as well as on the exclusion of other religions from this arrangement .
burmese resentment was strong and was vented in violent riots that paralysed yangon ( rangoon ) on occasion all the way until the 1930s . some of the discontent was caused by a disrespect for burmese culture and traditions such as the british refusal to remove shoes when they entered pagodas . buddhist monks became the vanguards of the independence movement . u wisara , an activist monk , died in prison after a 166-day hunger strike to protest against a rule that forbade him from wearing his buddhist robes while imprisoned .
prior to king henry 's departure for the battle of agincourt in 1415 , the ringleaders of the " southampton plot " - richard , earl of cambridge , henry scrope , 3rd baron scrope of masham , and sir thomas grey of heton - were accused of high treason and tried at what is now the red lion public house in the high street . they were found guilty and summarily executed outside the bargate .
wary of protests , the indian authorities have decided to shorten the route of the relay in new delhi , and have given it the security normally associated with republic day celebrations , which are considered terrorist targets . chinese intelligence 's expectations of points on the relay route that would be particularly ' vulnerable ' to protesters were presented to the indian ambassador to beijing , nirupama sen. the indian media responded angrily to the news that the ambassador , a distinguished lady diplomat , was summoned to the foreign ministry at 2 am local time ; the news was later denied by anonymous sources in delhi . the indian media reported that india 's commerce minister , kamal nath , cancelled an official trip to beijing in protest , though both nath and chinese sources have denied it .
with the mixture of radio friendly ac tunes with some rock and pop fare also landing on the pop charts , mainstream songs won over many critics in the need to define ac , and appeared to change the tolerance and acceptance of ac music into mainstream day to day radio play . part of the reason why more and more hot ac stations are forced to change is that less and less new music fits their bill ; most new rock is too alternative for mainstream radio and most new pop is now influenced heavily by dance-pop and electronic dance music .
red was also a badge of rank . during the song dynasty ( 906-1279 ) , officials of the top three ranks wore purple clothes ; those of the fourth and fifth wore bright red ; those of the sixth and seventh wore green ; and the eighth and ninth wore blue . red was the color worn by the royal guards of honor , and the color of the carriages of the imperial family . when the imperial family traveled , their servants and accompanying officials carried red and purple umbrellas . of an official who had talent and ambition , it was said " he is so red he becomes purple . "
the antarctic fur seal was very heavily hunted in the 18th and 19th centuries for its pelt by sealers from the united states and the united kingdom . the weddell seal , a " true seal , " is named after sir james weddell , commander of british sealing expeditions in the weddell sea . antarctic krill , which congregate in large schools , is the keystone species of the ecosystem of the southern ocean , and is an important food organism for whales , seals , leopard seals , fur seals , squid , icefish , penguins , albatrosses and many other birds .
a dispute during the lausanne congress of supreme councils of 1875 prompted the grand orient de france to commission a report by a protestant pastor which concluded that , as freemasonry was not a religion , it should not require a religious belief . the new constitutions read , " its principles are absolute liberty of conscience and human solidarity , " the existence of god and the immortality of the soul being struck out . it is possible that the immediate objections of the united grand lodge of england were at least partly motivated by the political tension between france and britain at the time . the result was the withdrawal of recognition of the grand orient of france by the united grand lodge of england , a situation that continues today .
the earthquake left at least 5 million people without housing , although the number could be as high as 11 million . millions of livestock and a significant amount of agriculture were also destroyed , including 12.5 million animals , mainly birds . in the sichuan province a million pigs died out of 60 million total . catastrophe modeling firm air worldwide reported official estimates of insurers ' losses at us $ 1 billion from the earthquake ; estimated total damages exceed us $ 20 billion . it values chengdu , at the time having an urban population of 4.5 million people , at around us $ 115 billion , with only a small portion covered by insurance .
in october 2014 , it was announced that beyonce with her management company parkwood entertainment would be partnering with london-based fashion retailer topshop , in a new 50 / 50 split subsidiary business named parkwood topshop athletic ltd . the new division was created for topshop to break into the activewear market , with an athletic , street wear brand being produced .

thermal conductivity gauges rely on the fact that the ability of a gas to conduct heat decreases with pressure . in this type of gauge , a wire filament is heated by running current through it . a thermocouple or resistance temperature detector ( rtd ) can then be used to measure the temperature of the filament . this temperature is dependent on the rate at which the filament loses heat to the surrounding gas , and therefore on the thermal conductivity . a common variant is the pirani gauge which uses a single platinum filament as both the heated element and rtd . these gauges are accurate from 10 torr to 10 − 3 torr , but they are sensitive to the chemical composition of the gases being measured .
von neumann introduced the study of rings of operators , through the von neumann algebras . a von neumann algebra is a * -algebra of bounded operators on a hilbert space that is closed in the weak operator topology and contains the identity operator . the von neumann bicommutant theorem shows that the analytic definition is equivalent to a purely algebraic definition as an algebra of symmetries . the direct integral was introduced in 1949 by john von neumann . one of von neumann 's analyses was to reduce the classification of von neumann algebras on separable hilbert spaces to the classification of factors .
more radical reformists were increasingly convinced that a rapid transition to a market economy was required , even if the eventual outcome meant the disintegration of the soviet union into several independent states . independence also accorded with yeltsin 's desires as president of the russian federation , as well as those of regional and local authorities to get rid of moscow 's pervasive control . in contrast to the reformers ' lukewarm response to the treaty , the conservatives , " patriots , " and russian nationalists of the ussr - still strong within the cpsu and the military - were opposed to weakening the soviet state and its centralized power structure .
eisenhower told district of columbia officials to make washington a model for the rest of the country in integrating black and white public school children . he proposed to congress the civil rights act of 1957 and of 1960 and signed those acts into law . the 1957 act for the first time established a permanent civil rights office inside the justice department and a civil rights commission to hear testimony about abuses of voting rights . although both acts were much weaker than subsequent civil rights legislation , they constituted the first significant civil rights acts since 1875 .
since life began on earth , five major mass extinctions and several minor events have led to large and sudden drops in biodiversity . the phanerozoic eon ( the last 540 million years ) marked a rapid growth in biodiversity via the cambrian explosion - a period during which the majority of multicellular phyla first appeared . the next 400 million years included repeated , massive biodiversity losses classified as mass extinction events . in the carboniferous , rainforest collapse led to a great loss of plant and animal life . the permian-triassic extinction event , 251 million years ago , was the worst ; vertebrate recovery took 30 million years . the most recent , the cretaceous-paleogene extinction event , occurred 65 million years ago and has often attracted more attention than others because it resulted in the extinction of the dinosaurs .
since annelids are soft-bodied , their fossils are rare - mostly jaws and the mineralized tubes that some of the species secreted . although some late ediacaran fossils may represent annelids , the oldest known fossil that is identified with confidence comes from about 518 million years ago in the early cambrian period . fossils of most modern mobile polychaete groups appeared by the end of the carboniferous , about 299 million years ago . palaeontologists disagree about whether some body fossils from the mid ordovician , about 472 to 461 million years ago , are the remains of oligochaetes , and the earliest indisputable fossils of the group appear in the tertiary period , which began 65 million years ago .
an earthworm 's digestive system consists of a mouth , pharynx , esophagus , crop , gizzard , and intestine . the mouth is surrounded by strong lips , which act like a hand to grab pieces of dead grass , leaves , and weeds , with bits of soil to help chew . the lips break the food down into smaller pieces . in the pharynx , the food is lubricated by mucus secretions for easier passage . the esophagus adds calcium carbonate to neutralize the acids formed by food matter decay . temporary storage occurs in the crop where food and calcium carbonate are mixed . the powerful muscles of the gizzard churn and mix the mass of food and dirt . when the churning is complete , the glands in the walls of the gizzard add enzymes to the thick paste , which helps chemically breakdown the organic matter . by peristalsis , the mixture is sent to the intestine where friendly bacteria continue chemical breakdown . this releases carbohydrates , protein , fat , and various vitamins and minerals for absorption into the body .
in 2006 , the animal rights organization people for the ethical treatment of animals ( peta ) , criticized beyonce for wearing and using fur in her clothing line house of dereon . in 2011 , she appeared on the cover of french fashion magazine l 'officiel , in blackface and tribal makeup that drew criticism from the media . a statement released from a spokesperson for the magazine said that beyonce 's look was " far from the glamorous sasha fierce " and that it was " a return to her african roots . "
in october 2004 , sarah forsyth claimed that she had been dismissed unfairly by eton college and had been bullied by senior staff . she also claimed she was instructed to do some of prince harry 's coursework to enable him to pass as art . as evidence , forsyth provided secretly recorded conversations with both prince harry and her head of department , ian burke . an employment tribunal in july 2005 found that she had been unfairly dismissed and criticised burke for bullying her and for repeatedly changing his story . it also criticised the school for failing to produce its capability procedures and criticised the head master for not reviewing the case independently .
fossilized spores suggest that higher plants ( embryophytes ) have lived on land for at least 475 million years . early land plants reproduced sexually with flagellated , swimming sperm , like the green algae from which they evolved . an adaptation to terrestrialization was the development of upright meiosporangia for dispersal by spores to new habitats . this feature is lacking in the descendants of their nearest algal relatives , the charophycean green algae . a later terrestrial adaptation took place with retention of the delicate , avascular sexual stage , the gametophyte , within the tissues of the vascular sporophyte . this occurred by spore germination within sporangia rather than spore release , as in non-seed plants . a current example of how this might have happened can be seen in the precocious spore germination in selaginella , the spike-moss . the result for the ancestors of angiosperms was enclosing them in a case , the seed . the first seed bearing plants , like the ginkgo , and conifers ( such as pines and firs ) , did not produce flowers . the pollen grains ( males ) of ginkgo and cycads produce a pair of flagellated , mobile sperm cells that " swim " down the developing pollen tube to the female and her eggs .
a police force is a constituted body of persons empowered by the state to enforce the law , protect property , and limit civil disorder . their powers include the legitimized use of force . the term is most commonly associated with police services of a sovereign state that are authorized to exercise the police power of that state within a defined legal or territorial area of responsibility . police forces are often defined as being separate from military or other organizations involved in the defense of the state against foreign aggressors ; however , gendarmerie are military units charged with civil policing .
the old swiss confederacy had acquired a reputation of invincibility during these earlier wars , but expansion of the federation suffered a setback in 1515 with the swiss defeat in the battle of marignano . this ended the so-called " heroic " epoch of swiss history . the success of zwingli 's reformation in some cantons led to inter-cantonal religious conflicts in 1529 and 1531 ( wars of kappel ) . it was not until more than one hundred years after these internal wars that , in 1648 , under the peace of westphalia , european countries recognized switzerland 's independence from the holy roman empire and its neutrality .
at the time of her accession , the government was led by the whig prime minister lord melbourne , who at once became a powerful influence on the politically inexperienced queen , who relied on him for advice . charles greville supposed that the widowed and childless melbourne was " passionately fond of her as he might be of his daughter if he had one , " and victoria probably saw him as a father figure . her coronation took place on 28 june 1838 at westminster abbey . over 400,000 visitors came to london for the celebrations . she became the first sovereign to take up residence at buckingham palace and inherited the revenues of the duchies of lancaster and cornwall as well as being granted a civil list allowance of £ 385,000 per year . financially prudent , she paid off her father 's debts .
architectural classicism is heavily represented in all districts of the city , particularly in downtown , the fan , and the museum district . several notable classical architects have designed buildings in richmond . the virginia state capitol was designed by thomas jefferson and charles-louis clerisseau in 1785 . it is the second-oldest us statehouse in continuous use ( after maryland 's ) and was the first us government building built in the neo-classical style of architecture , setting the trend for other state houses and the federal government buildings ( including the white house and the capitol ) in washington , d.c. robert mills designed monumental church on broad street . adjoining it is the 1845 egyptian building , one of the few egyptian revival buildings in the united states .
in the high villages people live in homes built according to medieval designs that withstand cold winters . the kitchen is separated from the living area ( called the stube , the area of the home heated by a stove ) , and second-floor bedrooms benefit from rising heat . the typical swiss chalet originated in the bernese oberland . chalets often face south or downhill , and are built of solid wood , with a steeply gabled roof to allow accumulated snow to slide off easily . stairs leading to upper levels are sometimes built on the outside , and balconies are sometimes enclosed .
as noted above , there are 55 tinkhundla in swaziland and each elects one representative to the house of assembly of swaziland . each inkhundla has a development committee ( bucopho ) elected from the various constituency chiefdoms in its area for a five-year term . bucopho bring to the inkhundla all matters of interest and concern to their various chiefdoms , and take back to the chiefdoms the decisions of the inkhundla . the chairman of the bucopho is elected at the inkhundla and is called indvuna ye nkhundla .
the strategy behind the formation of the warsaw pact was driven by the desire of the soviet union to dominate central and eastern europe . this policy was driven by ideological and geostrategic reasons . ideologically , the soviet union arrogated the right to define socialism and communism and act as the leader of the global socialist movement . a corollary to this idea was the necessity of intervention if a country appeared to be violating core socialist ideas and communist party functions , which was explicitly stated in the brezhnev doctrine . geostrategic principles also drove the soviet union to prevent invasion of its territory by western european powers .
native americans in the united states make up 0.97 % to 2 % of the population . in the 2010 census , 2.9 million people self-identified as native american , native hawaiian , and alaska native alone , and 5.2 million people identified as u.s. native americans , either alone or in combination with one or more ethnicity or other races . 1.8 million are recognized as enrolled tribal members . [ citation needed ] tribes have established their own criteria for membership , which are often based on blood quantum , lineal descent , or residency . a minority of us native americans live in land units called indian reservations . some california and southwestern tribes , such as the kumeyaay , cocopa , pascua yaqui and apache span both sides of the us-mexican border . haudenosaunee people have the legal right to freely cross the us-canadian border . athabascan , tlingit , haida , tsimshian , inupiat , blackfeet , nakota , cree , anishinaabe , huron , lenape , mi 'kmaq , penobscot , and haudenosaunee , among others live in both canada and the us .
in the latter half of his career hayek made a number of contributions to social and political philosophy , which he based on his views on the limits of human knowledge , and the idea of spontaneous order in social institutions . he argues in favour of a society organised around a market order , in which the apparatus of state is employed almost ( though not entirely ) exclusively to enforce the legal order ( consisting of abstract rules , and not particular commands ) necessary for a market of free individuals to function . these ideas were informed by a moral philosophy derived from epistemological concerns regarding the inherent limits of human knowledge . hayek argued that his ideal individualistic , free-market polity would be self-regulating to such a degree that it would be ' a society which does not depend for its functioning on our finding good men for running it ' .
the saturday edition of the times contains a variety of supplements . these supplements were relaunched in january 2009 as : sport , weekend ( including travel and lifestyle features ) , saturday review ( arts , books , and ideas ) , the times magazine ( columns on various topics ) , and playlist ( an entertainment listings guide ) .
the 2nd edition ( 1787 ) contained a refutation of idealism to distinguish his transcendental idealism from descartes 's sceptical idealism and berkeley 's anti-realist strain of subjective idealism . the section paralogisms of pure reason is an implicit critique of descartes ' idealism . kant says that it is not possible to infer the ' i ' as an object ( descartes ' cogito ergo sum ) purely from " the spontaneity of thought . " kant focused on ideas drawn from british philosophers such as locke , berkeley and hume but distinguished his transcendental or critical idealism from previous varieties ;
the aravalli range runs across the state from the southwest peak guru shikhar ( mount abu ) , which is 1,722 m in height , to khetri in the northeast . this range divides the state into 60 % in the northwest of the range and 40 % in the southeast . the northwest tract is sandy and unproductive with little water but improves gradually from desert land in the far west and northwest to comparatively fertile and habitable land towards the east . the area includes the thar desert . the south-eastern area , higher in elevation ( 100 to 350 m above sea level ) and more fertile , has a very diversified topography. in the south lies the hilly tract of mewar . in the southeast , a large area within the districts of kota and bundi forms a tableland . to the northeast of these districts is a rugged region ( badlands ) following the line of the chambal river . farther north the country levels out ; the flat plains of the northeastern bharatpur district are part of an alluvial basin . merta city lies in the geographical center of rajasthan .
other local colleges and universities include concordia university ann arbor , a lutheran liberal-arts institution ; a campus of the university of phoenix ; and cleary university , a private business school . washtenaw community college is located in neighboring ann arbor township . in 2000 , the ave maria school of law , a roman catholic law school established by domino 's pizza founder tom monaghan , opened in northeastern ann arbor , but the school moved to ave maria , florida in 2009 , and the thomas m. cooley law school acquired the former ave maria buildings for use as a branch campus .
under the supervision of may and taylor , numerous restoration projects have been under way involving queen 's lengthy audio and video catalogue . dvd releases of their 1986 wembley concert ( titled live at wembley stadium ) , 1982 milton keynes concert ( queen on fire - live at the bowl ) , and two greatest video hits ( volumes 1 and 2 , spanning the 1970s and 1980s ) have seen the band 's music remixed into 5.1 and dts surround sound . so far , only two of the band 's albums , a night at the opera and the game , have been fully remixed into high-resolution multichannel surround on dvd-audio . a night at the opera was re-released with some revised 5.1 mixes and accompanying videos in 2005 for the 30th anniversary of the album 's original release ( cd + dvd-video set ) . in 2007 , a blu-ray edition of queen 's previously released concerts , queen rock montreal & live aid , was released , marking their first project in 1080p hd .
the world bank has sponsored a project to curb air pollution through public transport improvements and the mexican government has started shutting down polluting factories . they have phased out diesel buses and mandated new emission controls on new cars ; since 1993 all new cars must be fitted with a catalytic converter , which reduces the emissions released . trucks must use only liquefied petroleum gas ( lpg ) . also construction of an underground rail system was begun in 1968 in order to help curb air pollution problems and alleviate traffic congestion . today it has over 201 km ( 125 mi ) of track and carries over 5 million people every day . fees are kept low to encourage use of the system and during rush hours the crush is so great , that authorities have reserved a special carriage specifically for women . due to these initiatives and others , the air quality in mexico city has begun to improve , with the air becoming cleaner since 1991 , when the air quality was declared to be a public health risk for 355 days of the year .

in some countries , such as britain and germany during the second world war , the soviet union and nato 's allied command europe , ground based air defence and air defence aircraft have been under integrated command and control . however , while overall air defence may be for homeland defence including military facilities , forces in the field , wherever they are , invariably deploy their own air defence capability if there is an air threat . a surface-based air defence capability can also be deployed offensively to deny the use of airspace to an opponent .
the doctrines of the assumption or dormition of mary relate to her death and bodily assumption to heaven . the roman catholic church has dogmaically defined the doctrine of the assumption , which was done in 1950 by pope pius xii in munificentissimus deus . whether the virgin mary died or not is not defined dogmatically , however , although a reference to the death of mary are made in munificentissimus deus . in the eastern orthodox church , the assumption of the virgin mary is believed , and celebrated with her dormition , where they believe she died .

the men 's basketball team has over 1,600 wins , one of only 12 schools who have reached that mark , and have appeared in 28 ncaa tournaments . former player austin carr holds the record for most points scored in a single game of the tournament with 61 . although the team has never won the ncaa tournament , they were named by the helms athletic foundation as national champions twice . the team has orchestrated a number of upsets of number one ranked teams , the most notable of which was ending ucla 's record 88-game winning streak in 1974 . the team has beaten an additional eight number-one teams , and those nine wins rank second , to ucla 's 10 , all-time in wins against the top team . the team plays in newly renovated purcell pavilion ( within the edmund p. joyce center ) , which reopened for the beginning of the 2009-2010 season . the team is coached by mike brey , who , as of the 2014-15 season , his fifteenth at notre dame , has achieved a 332-165 record . in 2009 they were invited to the nit , where they advanced to the semifinals but were beaten by penn state who went on and beat baylor in the championship . the 2010-11 team concluded its regular season ranked number seven in the country , with a record of 25-5 , brey 's fifth straight 20-win season , and a second-place finish in the big east . during the 2014-15 season , the team went 32-6 and won the acc conference tournament , later advancing to the elite 8 , where the fighting irish lost on a missed buzzer-beater against then undefeated kentucky . led by nba draft picks jerian grant and pat connaughton , the fighting irish beat the eventual national champion duke blue devils twice during the season . the 32 wins were the most by the fighting irish team since 1908-09 .
through the use of multidimensional scaling , psychologists can map out similar emotional experiences , which allows a visual depiction of the " emotional distance " between experiences . a further step can be taken by looking at the map 's dimensions of the emotional experiences . the emotional experiences are divided into two dimensions known as valence ( how negative or positive the experience feels ) and arousal ( how energized or enervated the experience feels ) . these two dimensions can be depicted on a 2d coordinate map . this two-dimensional map was theorized to capture one important component of emotion called core affect . core affect is not the only component to emotion , but gives the emotion its hedonic and felt energy .
in ancient indian philosophy , materialism developed around 600 bc with the works of ajita kesakambali , payasi , kanada , and the proponents of the carvaka school of philosophy . kanada became one of the early proponents of atomism . the nyaya-vaisesika school ( 600 bc - 100 bc ) developed one of the earliest forms of atomism , though their proofs of god and their positing that the consciousness was not material precludes labelling them as materialists . buddhist atomism and the jaina school continued the atomic tradition .

a few days before the fall of the city , the national government of china was relocated to the southwestern city chungking ( chongqing ) and resumed chinese resistance . in 1940 , a japanese-collaborationist government known as the " nanjing regime " or " reorganized national government of china " led by wang jingwei was established in nanjing as a rival to chiang kai-shek 's government in chongqing . in 1946 , after the surrender of japan , the kmt relocated its central government back to nanjing .
ibm has been a leading proponent of the open source initiative , and began supporting linux in 1998 . the company invests billions of dollars in services and software based on linux through the ibm linux technology center , which includes over 300 linux kernel developers . ibm has also released code under different open source licenses , such as the platform-independent software framework eclipse ( worth approximately us $ 40 million at the time of the donation ) , the three-sentence international components for unicode ( icu ) license , and the java-based relational database management system ( rdbms ) apache derby . ibm 's open source involvement has not been trouble-free , however ( see sco v. ibm ) .
melbourne is experiencing high population growth , generating high demand for housing . this housing boom has increased house prices and rents , as well as the availability of all types of housing . subdivision regularly occurs in the outer areas of melbourne , with numerous developers offering house and land packages . however , after 10 years [ when ? ] of planning policies to encourage medium-density and high-density development in existing areas with greater access to public transport and other services , melbourne 's middle and outer-ring suburbs have seen significant brownfields redevelopment .
cuba , like many spanish territories , wanted to break free from spain . a pro-independence movement in cuba was supported by the u.s. , and cuban guerrilla leaders wanted annexation to the united states , but cuban revolutionary leader jose marti called for cuban nationhood . when the u.s. battleship maine sank in havana harbor , the u.s. blamed spain and the spanish-american war broke out in 1898 . after the u.s. won , spain relinquished claim of sovereignty over territories , including cuba . the u.s. administered cuba as a protectorate until 1902 . several decades later in 1959 , the corrupt cuban government of u.s.-backed fulgencio batista was overthrown by fidel castro . castro installed a marxist-leninist government allied with the soviet union , which has been in power ever since .
in western europe , some of the older roman elite families died out while others became more involved with church than secular affairs . values attached to latin scholarship and education mostly disappeared , and while literacy remained important , it became a practical skill rather than a sign of elite status . in the 4th century , jerome ( d . 420 ) dreamed that god rebuked him for spending more time reading cicero than the bible . by the 6th century , gregory of tours ( d . 594 ) had a similar dream , but instead of being chastised for reading cicero , he was chastised for learning shorthand . by the late 6th century , the principal means of religious instruction in the church had become music and art rather than the book . most intellectual efforts went towards imitating classical scholarship , but some original works were created , along with now-lost oral compositions . the writings of sidonius apollinaris ( d . 489 ) , cassiodorus ( d. c . 585 ) , and boethius ( d. c . 525 ) were typical of the age .

in pennsylvania , there are over sixty summits that rise over 2,500 ft ( 800 m ) ; the summits of mount davis and blue knob rise over 3,000 ft ( 900 m ) . in maryland , eagle rock and dans mountain are conspicuous points reaching 3,162 ft ( 964 m ) and 2,882 ft ( 878 m ) respectively . on the same side of the great valley , south of the potomac , are the pinnacle 3,007 feet ( 917 m ) and pidgeon roost 3,400 ft ( 1,000 m ) . in west virginia , more than 150 peaks rise above 4,000 ft ( 1,200 m ) , including spruce knob 4,863 ft ( 1,482 m ) , the highest point in the allegheny mountains . a number of other points in the state rise above 4,800 ft ( 1,500 m ) . snowshoe mountain at thorny flat 4,848 ft ( 1,478 m ) and bald knob 4,842 ft ( 1,476 m ) are among the more notable peaks in west virginia .
pollination is the process by which pollen is transferred in the reproduction of plants , thereby enabling fertilisation and sexual reproduction . most flowering plants require an animal to do the transportation . while other animals are included as pollinators , the majority of pollination is done by insects . because insects usually receive benefit for the pollination in the form of energy rich nectar it is a grand example of mutualism . the various flower traits ( and combinations thereof ) that differentially attract one type of pollinator or another are known as pollination syndromes . these arose through complex plant-animal adaptations . pollinators find flowers through bright colorations , including ultraviolet , and attractant pheromones . the study of pollination by insects is known as anthecology .
western europe 's largest jewish community , and the third-largest jewish community in the world , can be found in france , home to between 483,000 and 500,000 jews , the majority of whom are immigrants or refugees from north african arab countries such as algeria , morocco , and tunisia ( or their descendants ) . the united kingdom has a jewish community of 292,000 . in eastern europe , there are anywhere from 350,000 to one million jews living in the former soviet union , but exact figures are difficult to establish . in germany , the 102,000 jews registered with the jewish community are a slowly declining population , despite the immigration of tens of thousands of jews from the former soviet union since the fall of the berlin wall . thousands of israelis also live in germany , either permanently or temporarily , for economic reasons .
the pulp papermaking process is said to have been developed in china during the early 2nd century ad , possibly as early as the year 105 a.d. , by the han court eunuch cai lun , although the earliest archaeological fragments of paper derive from the 2nd century bc in china . the modern pulp and paper industry is global , with china leading its production and the united states right behind it .
at the end of the war , the victorious powers sought to divide up the ottoman empire . signed between the allied and associated powers and ottoman empire at sevres on 10 august 1920 , the treaty of sevres promised to maintain the existence of the armenian republic and to attach the former territories of ottoman armenia to it . because the new borders of armenia were to be drawn by united states president woodrow wilson , ottoman armenia was also referred to as " wilsonian armenia . " in addition , just days prior , on 5 august 1920 , mihran damadian of the armenian national union , the de facto armenian administration in cilicia , declared the independence of cilicia as an armenian autonomous republic under french protectorate .
white light can be formed by mixing differently colored lights ; the most common method is to use red , green , and blue ( rgb ) . hence the method is called multi-color white leds ( sometimes referred to as rgb leds ) . because these need electronic circuits to control the blending and diffusion of different colors , and because the individual color leds typically have slightly different emission patterns ( leading to variation of the color depending on direction ) even if they are made as a single unit , these are seldom used to produce white lighting . nonetheless , this method has many applications because of the flexibility of mixing different colors , and in principle , this mechanism also has higher quantum efficiency in producing white light .

although many of fbi 's functions are unique , its activities in support of national security are comparable to those of the british mi5 and the russian fsb . unlike the central intelligence agency ( cia ) , which has no law enforcement authority and is focused on intelligence collection overseas , fbi is primarily a domestic agency , maintaining 56 field offices in major cities throughout the united states , and more than 400 resident agencies in lesser cities and areas across the nation . at an fbi field office , a senior-level fbi officer concurrently serves as the representative of the director of national intelligence .
with the gold rush largely over by 1860 , melbourne continued to grow on the back of continuing gold mining , as the major port for exporting the agricultural products of victoria , especially wool , and a developing manufacturing sector protected by high tariffs . an extensive radial railway network centred on melbourne and spreading out across the suburbs and into the countryside was established from the late 1850s . further major public buildings were begun in the 1860s and 1870s such as the supreme court , government house , and the queen victoria market . the central city filled up with shops and offices , workshops , and warehouses . large banks and hotels faced the main streets , with fine townhouses in the east end of collins street , contrasting with tiny cottages down laneways within the blocks . the aboriginal population continued to decline with an estimated 80 % total decrease by 1863 , due primarily to introduced diseases , particularly smallpox , frontier violence and dispossession from their lands .
the 2012-2013 cypriot financial crisis led to an agreement with the eurogroup in march 2013 to split the country 's second largest bank , the cyprus popular bank ( also known as laiki bank ) , into a " bad " bank which would be wound down over time and a " good " bank which would be absorbed by the bank of cyprus . in return for a € 10 billion bailout from the european commission , the european central bank and the international monetary fund , often referred to as the " troika , " the cypriot government was required to impose a significant haircut on uninsured deposits , a large proportion of which were held by wealthy russians who used cyprus as a tax haven . insured deposits of € 100,000 or less were not affected .
in september 1828 chopin , while still a student , visited berlin with a family friend , zoologist feliks jarocki , enjoying operas directed by gaspare spontini and attending concerts by carl friedrich zelter , felix mendelssohn and other celebrities . on an 1829 return trip to berlin , he was a guest of prince antoni radziwiłł , governor of the grand duchy of posen - himself an accomplished composer and aspiring cellist . for the prince and his pianist daughter wanda , he composed his introduction and polonaise brillante in c major for cello and piano , op. 3 .
there are several major exceptions on tuition fees . in many european countries , it is possible to study without tuition fees . public universities in nordic countries were entirely without tuition fees until around 2005 . denmark , sweden and finland then moved to put in place tuition fees for foreign students . citizens of eu and eea member states and citizens from switzerland remain exempted from tuition fees , and the amounts of public grants granted to promising foreign students were increased to offset some of the impact .
the punjabis followed a diverse plethora of faiths , mainly comprising hinduism [ citation needed ] , when the muslim umayyad army led by muhammad bin qasim conquered sindh and southern punjab in 712 , by defeating raja dahir . the umayyad caliphate was the second islamic caliphate established after the death of muhammad . it was ruled by the umayyad dynasty , whose name derives from umayya ibn abd shams , the great-grandfather of the first umayyad caliph . although the umayyad family originally came from the city of mecca , their capital was damascus . muhammad bin qasim was the first to bring message of islam to the population of punjab . [ citation needed ] punjab was part of different muslim empires consisting of afghans and turkic peoples in co-operation with local punjabi tribes and others . [ citation needed ] in the 11th century , during the reign of mahmud of ghazni , the province became an important centre with lahore as its second capital [ citation needed ] of the ghaznavid empire based out of afghanistan . the punjab region became predominantly muslim due to missionary sufi saints whose dargahs dot the landscape of punjab region .
the agglomeration of kathmandu has not yet been officially defined . the urban area of the kathmandu valley is split among three different districts ( collections of local government units within a zone ) which extend very little beyond the valley fringe , except towards the southern ranges , which have comparatively small population . they have the three highest population densities in the country . within the districts lie vdcs ( villages ) , 3 municipalities ( bhaktapur , kirtipur , madhyapur thimi ) , 1 sub-metropolitan city ( lalitpur ) , and 1 metropolitan city ( kathmandu ) . some district subdivisions remain legally villages yet are densely populated , gonggabu vdc notably recorded a density over 20,000 people / km2 . ( 2011 census ) . the following data table describes the districts considered part of the agglomeration :
the pagan slavic populations were christianized between the 6th and 10th centuries . orthodox christianity is predominant in the east and south slavs , while roman catholicism is predominant in west slavs and the western south slavs . the religious borders are largely comparable to the east-west schism which began in the 11th century . the majority of contemporary slavic populations who profess a religion are orthodox , followed by catholic , while a small minority are protestant . there are minor slavic muslim groups . religious delineations by nationality can be very sharp ; usually in the slavic ethnic groups the vast majority of religious people share the same religion . some slavs are atheist or agnostic : only 19 % of czechs professed belief in god / s in the 2005 eurobarometer survey .

the printed circuit board industry defines heavy copper as layers exceeding three ounces of copper , or approximately 0.0042 inches ( 4.2 mils , 105 μm ) thick . pcb designers and fabricators often use heavy copper when design and manufacturing circuit boards in order to increase current-carrying capacity as well as resistance to thermal strains . heavy copper plated vias transfer heat to external heat sinks . ipc 2152 is a standard for determining current-carrying capacity of printed circuit board traces .
some samoans are spiritual and religious , and have subtly adapted the dominant religion of christianity to ' fit in ' with fa 'a samoa and vice versa . as such , ancient beliefs continue to co-exist side-by-side with christianity , particularly in regard to the traditional customs and rituals of fa 'a samoa . the samoan culture is centred around the principle of vafealoa 'i , the relationships between people . these relationships are based on respect , or fa 'aaloalo . when christianity was introduced in samoa , most samoan people converted . currently 98 % of the population identify themselves as christian .
the vast majority of muslims in nigeria are sunni belonging to maliki school of jurisprudence ; however , a sizeable minority also belongs to shafi madhhab . a large number of sunni muslims are members of sufi brotherhoods . most sufis follow the qadiriyya , tijaniyyah and / or the mouride movements . a significant shia minority exists ( see shia in nigeria ) . some northern states have incorporated sharia law into their previously secular legal systems , which has brought about some controversy . kano state has sought to incorporate sharia law into its constitution . the majority of quranists follow the kalo kato or quraniyyun movement . there are also ahmadiyya and mahdiyya minorities .
ann arbor 's residential neighborhoods contain architectural styles ranging from classic 19th-century and early-20th-century designs to ranch-style houses . among these homes are a number of kit houses built in the early 20th century . contemporary-style houses are farther from the downtown district . surrounding the university of michigan campus are houses and apartment complexes occupied primarily by student renters . tower plaza , a 26-story condominium building located between the university of michigan campus and downtown , is the tallest building in ann arbor . the 19th-century buildings and streetscape of the old west side neighborhood have been preserved virtually intact ; in 1972 , the district was listed on the national register of historic places , and it is further protected by city ordinances and a nonprofit preservation group .
however , excessive hunting and poachers have also contributed heavily to the endangerment , extirpation and extinction of many animals , such as the quagga , the great auk , steller 's sea cow , the thylacine , the bluebuck , the arabian oryx , the caspian and javan tigers , the markhor , the sumatran rhinoceros , the bison , the north american cougar , the altai argali sheep , the asian elephant and many more , primarily for commercial sale or sport . all these animals have been hunted to endangerment or extinction .
the somali telecommunication association ( sta ) , a watchdog organization that oversees the policy development and regulatory framework of somalia 's ict sector , reported in 2006 that there were over half a million users of internet services within the territory . there were also 22 established isps and 234 cyber cafes , with an annual growth rate of 15.6 % .
victoria 's father was prince edward , duke of kent and strathearn , the fourth son of the reigning king of the united kingdom , george iii . until 1817 , edward 's niece , princess charlotte of wales , was the only legitimate grandchild of george iii . her death in 1817 precipitated a succession crisis that brought pressure on the duke of kent and his unmarried brothers to marry and have children . in 1818 he married princess victoria of saxe-coburg-saalfeld , a widowed german princess with two children - carl ( 1804-1856 ) and feodora ( 1807-1872 ) - by her first marriage to the prince of leiningen . her brother leopold was princess charlotte 's widower . the duke and duchess of kent 's only child , victoria , was born at 4.15 a.m. on 24 may 1819 at kensington palace in london .
jidaigeki ( literally historical drama ) has always been a staple program on japanese movies and television . the programs typically feature a samurai . samurai films and westerns share a number of similarities and the two have influenced each other over the years . one of japan 's most renowned directors , akira kurosawa , greatly influenced the samurai aspect in western film-making . [ citation needed ] george lucas ' star wars series incorporated many aspects from the seven samurai film . one example is that in the japanese film , seven samurai warriors are hired by local farmers to protect their land from being overrun by bandits ; in george lucas ' star wars : a new hope , a similar situation arises . kurosawa was inspired by the works of director john ford and in turn kurosawa 's works have been remade into westerns such as the seven samurai into the magnificent seven and yojimbo into a fistful of dollars . there is also a 26 episode anime adaptation ( samurai 7 ) of the seven samurai . along with film , literature containing samurai influences are seen as well .
mechanically controlled variable capacitors allow the plate spacing to be adjusted , for example by rotating or sliding a set of movable plates into alignment with a set of stationary plates . low cost variable capacitors squeeze together alternating layers of aluminum and plastic with a screw . electrical control of capacitance is achievable with varactors ( or varicaps ) , which are reverse-biased semiconductor diodes whose depletion region width varies with applied voltage . they are used in phase-locked loops , amongst other applications .
john ( 24 december 1166 - 19 october 1216 ) , also known as john lackland ( norman french : johan sanz terre ) , was king of england from 6 april 1199 until his death in 1216 . john lost the duchy of normandy to king philip ii of france , which resulted in the collapse of most of the angevin empire and contributed to the subsequent growth in power of the capetian dynasty during the 13th century . the baronial revolt at the end of john 's reign led to the sealing of the magna carta , a document sometimes considered to be an early step in the evolution of the constitution of the united kingdom .
in 1847 , hungarian physician ignac fulop semmelweis dramatically reduced the occurrency of puerperal fever by simply requiring physicians to wash their hands before attending to women in childbirth . this discovery predated the germ theory of disease . however , semmelweis ' findings were not appreciated by his contemporaries and came into use only with discoveries by british surgeon joseph lister , who in 1865 proved the principles of antisepsis . lister 's work was based on the important findings by french biologist louis pasteur . pasteur was able to link microorganisms with disease , revolutionizing medicine . he also devised one of the most important methods in preventive medicine , when in 1880 he produced a vaccine against rabies . pasteur invented the process of pasteurization , to help prevent the spread of disease through milk and other foods .
by 59 bc an unofficial political alliance known as the first triumvirate was formed between gaius julius caesar , marcus licinius crassus , and gnaeus pompeius magnus ( " pompey the great " ) to share power and influence . in 53 bc , crassus launched a roman invasion of the parthian empire ( modern iraq and iran ) . after initial successes , he marched his army deep into the desert ; but here his army was cut off deep in enemy territory , surrounded and slaughtered at the battle of carrhae in which crassus himself perished . the death of crassus removed some of the balance in the triumvirate and , consequently , caesar and pompey began to move apart . while caesar was fighting in gaul , pompey proceeded with a legislative agenda for rome that revealed that he was at best ambivalent towards caesar and perhaps now covertly allied with caesar 's political enemies . in 51 bc , some roman senators demanded that caesar not be permitted to stand for consul unless he turned over control of his armies to the state , which would have left caesar defenceless before his enemies . caesar chose civil war over laying down his command and facing trial .
this technique was very expensive , though , and could not be used for applications such as telemedicine , distance education , and business meetings . attempts at using normal telephony networks to transmit slow-scan video , such as the first systems developed by at & t corporation , first researched in the 1950s , failed mostly due to the poor picture quality and the lack of efficient video compression techniques . the greater 1 mhz bandwidth and 6 mbit / s bit rate of the picturephone in the 1970s also did not achieve commercial success , mostly due to its high cost , but also due to a lack of network effect - with only a few hundred picturephones in the world , users had extremely few contacts they could actually call to , and interoperability with other videophone systems would not exist for decades .
the british high-definition tv service started trials in august 1936 and a regular service on 2 november 1936 using both the ( mechanical ) baird 240 line sequential scan ( later to be inaccurately rechristened ' progressive ' ) and the ( electronic ) marconi-emi 405 line interlaced systems . the baird system was discontinued in february 1937 . in 1938 france followed with their own 441-line system , variants of which were also used by a number of other countries . the us ntsc 525-line system joined in 1941 . in 1949 france introduced an even higher-resolution standard at 819 lines , a system that should have been high definition even by today 's standards , but was monochrome only and the technical limitations of the time prevented it from achieving the definition of which it should have been capable . all of these systems used interlacing and a 4 : 3 aspect ratio except the 240-line system which was progressive ( actually described at the time by the technically correct term " sequential " ) and the 405-line system which started as 5 : 4 and later changed to 4 : 3 . the 405-line system adopted the ( at that time ) revolutionary idea of interlaced scanning to overcome the flicker problem of the 240-line with its 25 hz frame rate . the 240-line system could have doubled its frame rate but this would have meant that the transmitted signal would have doubled in bandwidth , an unacceptable option as the video baseband bandwidth was required to be not more than 3 mhz .
boston 's colleges and universities have a significant effect on the regional economy . boston attracts more than 350,000 college students from around the world , who contribute more than $ 4.8 billion annually to the city 's economy . the area 's schools are major employers and attract industries to the city and surrounding region . the city is home to a number of technology companies and is a hub for biotechnology , with the milken institute rating boston as the top life sciences cluster in the country . boston receives the highest absolute amount of annual funding from the national institutes of health of all cities in the united states .
aside from the lignocellulose , wood consists of a variety of low molecular weight organic compounds , called extractives . the wood extractives are fatty acids , resin acids , waxes and terpenes . for example , rosin is exuded by conifers as protection from insects . the extraction of these organic materials from wood provides tall oil , turpentine , and rosin .
the government exerts greater control over broadcast media than print media , especially due to finance and licensing . the swiss broadcasting corporation , whose name was recently changed to srg ssr , is charged with the production and broadcast of radio and television programs . srg ssr studios are distributed throughout the various language regions . radio content is produced in six central and four regional studios while the television programs are produced in geneva , zurich and lugano . an extensive cable network also allows most swiss to access the programs from neighboring countries .
tito 's estrangement from the ussr enabled yugoslavia to obtain us aid via the economic cooperation administration ( eca ) , the same us aid institution which administered the marshall plan . still , he did not agree to align with the west , which was a common consequence of accepting american aid at the time . after stalin 's death in 1953 , relations with the ussr were relaxed and he began to receive aid as well from the comecon . in this way , tito played east-west antagonism to his advantage . instead of choosing sides , he was instrumental in kick-starting the non-aligned movement , which would function as a ' third way ' for countries interested in staying outside of the east-west divide .
charles " wag " bennett , one of the judges at the 1966 competition , was impressed with schwarzenegger and he offered to coach him . as schwarzenegger had little money , bennett invited him to stay in his crowded family home above one of his two gyms in forest gate , london , england . yorton 's leg definition had been judged superior , and schwarzenegger , under a training program devised by bennett , concentrated on improving the muscle definition and power in his legs . staying in the east end of london helped schwarzenegger improve his rudimentary grasp of the english language . also in 1966 , schwarzenegger had the opportunity to meet childhood idol reg park , who became his friend and mentor . the training paid off and , in 1967 , schwarzenegger won the title for the first time , becoming the youngest ever mr. universe at the age of 20 . he would go on to win the title a further three times . schwarzenegger then flew back to munich , training for four to six hours daily , attending business school and working in a health club ( rolf putziger 's gym where he worked and trained from 1966-1968 ) , returning in 1968 to london to win his next mr. universe title . he frequently told roger c. field , his english coach and friend in munich at that time , " i 'm going to become the greatest actor ! "
the emperor diocletian ( r . 284-305 ) split the empire into separately administered eastern and western halves in 286 ; the empire was not considered divided by its inhabitants or rulers , as legal and administrative promulgations in one division were considered valid in the other . [ c ] in 330 , after a period of civil war , constantine the great ( r . 306-337 ) refounded the city of byzantium as the newly renamed eastern capital , constantinople . diocletian 's reforms strengthened the governmental bureaucracy , reformed taxation , and strengthened the army , which bought the empire time but did not resolve the problems it was facing : excessive taxation , a declining birthrate , and pressures on its frontiers , among others . civil war between rival emperors became common in the middle of the 4th century , diverting soldiers from the empire 's frontier forces and allowing invaders to encroach . for much of the 4th century , roman society stabilised in a new form that differed from the earlier classical period , with a widening gulf between the rich and poor , and a decline in the vitality of the smaller towns . another change was the christianisation , or conversion of the empire to christianity , a gradual process that lasted from the 2nd to the 5th centuries .
the conceptual view provides a level of indirection between internal and external . on one hand it provides a common view of the database , independent of different external view structures , and on the other hand it abstracts away details of how the data are stored or managed ( internal level ) . in principle every level , and even every external view , can be presented by a different data model . in practice usually a given dbms uses the same data model for both the external and the conceptual levels ( e.g. , relational model ) . the internal level , which is hidden inside the dbms and depends on its implementation , requires a different level of detail and uses its own types of data structure types .
the majority of the province 's population is han chinese , who are found scattered throughout the region with the exception of the far western areas . thus , significant minorities of tibetan , yi , qiang and nakhi people reside in the western portion that are impacted by inclement weather and natural disasters , environmentally fragile , and impoverished . sichuan 's capital of chengdu is home to a large community of tibetans , with 30,000 permanent tibetan residents and up to 200,000 tibetan floating population . the eastern lipo , included with either the yi or the lisu people , as well as the a-hmao , also are among the ethnic groups of the provinces .
encoder / decoder overall delay is not defined , which means there is no official provision for gapless playback . however , some encoders such as lame can attach additional metadata that will allow players that can handle it to deliver seamless playback .
while the federal district was ruled by the federal government through an appointed governor , the municipalities within it were autonomous , and this duality of powers created tension between the municipalities and the federal government for more than a century . in 1903 , porfirio diaz largely reduced the powers of the municipalities within the federal district . eventually , in december 1928 , the federal government decided to abolish all the municipalities of the federal district . in place of the municipalities , the federal district was divided into one " central department " and 13 delegaciones ( boroughs ) administered directly by the government of the federal district . the central department was integrated by the former municipalities of mexico city , tacuba , tacubaya and mixcoac .
the jordan rift valley is the result of tectonic movements within the dead sea transform ( dsf ) fault system . the dsf forms the transform boundary between the african plate to the west and the arabian plate to the east . the golan heights and all of jordan are part of the arabian plate , while the galilee , west bank , coastal plain , and negev along with the sinai peninsula are on the african plate . this tectonic disposition leads to a relatively high seismic activity in the region . the entire jordan valley segment is thought to have ruptured repeatedly , for instance during the last two major earthquakes along this structure in 749 and 1033 . the deficit in slip that has built up since the 1033 event is sufficient to cause an earthquake of mw ~ 7.4 .
china 's network security and information technology leadership team was established february 27 , 2014 . the leadership team is tasked with national security and long-term development and co-ordination of major issues related to network security and information technology . economic , political , cultural , social and military fields as related to network security and information technology strategy , planning and major macroeconomic policy are being researched . the promotion of national network security and information technology law are constantly under study for enhanced national security capabilities .
in the prussian province of posen , with a large polish population , there was strong support for the french and angry demonstrations at news of prussian-german victories - a clear manifestation of polish nationalist feeling . calls were also made for polish recruits to desert from the prussian army - though these went mainly unheeded . an alarming report on the posen situation , sent to bismarck on 16 august 1870 , led to the quartering of reserve troop contingents in the restive province . the franco-prussian war thus turned out to be a significant event also in german-polish relations , marking the beginning of a prolonged period of repressive measures by the authorities and efforts at germanisation .
the almost constant wars among the sumerian city-states for 2000 years helped to develop the military technology and techniques of sumer to a high level . the first war recorded in any detail was between lagash and umma in c . 2525 bc on a stele called the stele of the vultures . it shows the king of lagash leading a sumerian army consisting mostly of infantry . the infantrymen carried spears , wore copper helmets , and carried rectangular shields . the spearmen are shown arranged in what resembles the phalanx formation , which requires training and discipline ; this implies that the sumerians may have made use of professional soldiers .
the instrument was primarily used in an ensemble setting well into the 1930s , and although the fad died out at the beginning of the 1930s , the instruments that were developed for the orchestra found a new home in bluegrass . the famous lloyd loar master model from gibson ( 1923 ) was designed to boost the flagging interest in mandolin ensembles , with little success . however , the " loar " became the defining instrument of bluegrass music when bill monroe purchased f-5 s / n 73987 in a florida barbershop in 1943 and popularized it as his main instrument .
the term mainly refers to a mix of lithium and aluminosilicates that yields an array of materials with interesting thermomechanical properties . the most commercially important of these have the distinction of being impervious to thermal shock . thus , glass-ceramics have become extremely useful for countertop cooking . the negative thermal expansion coefficient ( cte ) of the crystalline ceramic phase can be balanced with the positive cte of the glassy phase . at a certain point ( ~ 70 % crystalline ) the glass-ceramic has a net cte near zero . this type of glass-ceramic exhibits excellent mechanical properties and can sustain repeated and quick temperature changes up to 1000 ° c .
voiced consonants are seldom actually aspirated . symbols for voiced consonants followed by ⟨ ◌ ʰ ⟩ , such as ⟨ bʰ ⟩ , typically represent consonants with breathy voiced release ( see below ) . in the grammatical tradition of sanskrit , aspirated consonants are called voiceless aspirated , and breathy-voiced consonants are called voiced aspirated .
comcast has also earned a reputation for being anti-union . according to one of the company 's training manuals , " comcast does not feel union representation is in the best interest of its employees , customers , or shareholders . " a dispute in 2004 with cwa , a labor union that represented many employees at comcast 's offices in beaverton , oregon , led to allegations of management intimidating workers , requiring them to attend anti-union meetings and unwarranted disciplinary action for union members . in 2011 , comcast received criticism from writers guild of america for its policies in regards to unions .
the egyptians were one of the first major civilisations to codify design elements in art and architecture . egyptian blue , also known as calcium copper silicate is a pigment used by egyptians for thousands of years . it is considered to be the first synthetic pigment . the wall paintings done in the service of the pharaohs followed a rigid code of visual rules and meanings . egyptian civilisation is renowned for its colossal pyramids , temples and monumental tombs . well-known examples are the pyramid of djoser designed by ancient architect and engineer imhotep , the sphinx , and the temple of abu simbel . modern and contemporary egyptian art can be as diverse as any works in the world art scene , from the vernacular architecture of hassan fathy and ramses wissa wassef , to mahmoud mokhtar 's sculptures , to the distinctive coptic iconography of isaac fanous . the cairo opera house serves as the main performing arts venue in the egyptian capital .
the un ultimately created a treaty on principles governing the activities of states in the exploration and use of outer space , including the moon and other celestial bodies , which was signed by the united states , ussr , and the united kingdom on january 27 , 1967 and went into force the following october 10 .
greece is a developed country with an economy based on the service ( 82.8 % ) and industrial sectors ( 13.3 % ) . the agricultural sector contributed 3.9 % of national economic output in 2015 . important greek industries include tourism and shipping . with 18 million international tourists in 2013 , greece was the 7th most visited country in the european union and 16th in the world . the greek merchant navy is the largest in the world , with greek-owned vessels accounting for 15 % of global deadweight tonnage as of 2013 . the increased demand for international maritime transportation between greece and asia has resulted in unprecedented investment in the shipping industry .
chopin took the new salon genre of the nocturne , invented by the irish composer john field , to a deeper level of sophistication . he was the first to write ballades and scherzi as individual concert pieces . he essentially established a new genre with his own set of free-standing preludes ( op. 28 , published 1839 ) . he exploited the poetic potential of the concept of the concert etude , already being developed in the 1820s and 1830s by liszt , clementi and moscheles , in his two sets of studies ( op. 10 published in 1833 , op. 25 in 1837 ) .
the macintosh se was released at the same time as the macintosh ii for $ 2900 ( or $ 3900 with hard drive ) , as the first compact mac with a 20 mb internal hard drive and an expansion slot . the se 's expansion slot was located inside the case along with the crt , potentially exposing an upgrader to high voltage . for this reason , apple recommended users bring their se to an authorized apple dealer to have upgrades performed . the se also updated jerry manock and terry oyama 's original design and shared the macintosh ii 's snow white design language , as well as the new apple desktop bus ( adb ) mouse and keyboard that had first appeared on the apple iigs some months earlier .
the economy relies heavily on investment and support from armenians abroad . before independence , armenia 's economy was largely industry-based - chemicals , electronics , machinery , processed food , synthetic rubber , and textile - and highly dependent on outside resources . the republic had developed a modern industrial sector , supplying machine tools , textiles , and other manufactured goods to sister republics in exchange for raw materials and energy . recently , the intel corporation agreed to open a research center in armenia , in addition to other technology companies , signalling the growth of the technology industry in armenia .
in addition to limiting the total average power used by the device , the usb specification limits the inrush current ( i.e. , that used to charge decoupling and filter capacitors ) when the device is first connected . otherwise , connecting a device could cause problems with the host 's internal power . usb devices are also required to automatically enter ultra low-power suspend mode when the usb host is suspended . nevertheless , many usb host interfaces do not cut off the power supply to usb devices when they are suspended .
some estonians , unwilling to side directly with the nazis , joined the finnish army ( which was allied with the nazis ) to fight against the soviet union . the finnish infantry regiment 200 ( estonian : soomepoisid ) was formed out of estonian volunteers in finland . although many estonians were recruited into the german armed forces ( including estonian waffen-ss ) , the majority of them did so only in 1944 when the threat of a new invasion of estonia by the red army had become imminent . in january 1944 estonia was again facing the prospect of invasion from the red army and the last legitimate prime minister of the republic of estonia ( according to the constitution of the republic of estonia ) delivered a radio address asking all able-bodied men born from 1904 through 1923 to report for military service . the call resulted in around 38,000 new enlistments and several thousand estonians who had joined the finnish army came back to join the newly formed territorial defense force , assigned to defend estonia against the soviet advance . it was hoped [ by whom ? ] that by engaging in such a war estonia would be able to attract western support for estonian independence .
according to a study by the china earthquake administration ( cea ) , the earthquake occurred along the longmenshan fault , a thrust structure along the border of the indo-australian plate and eurasian plate . seismic activities concentrated on its mid-fracture ( known as yingxiu-beichuan fracture ) . the rupture lasted close to 120 sec , with the majority of energy released in the first 80 sec . starting from wenchuan , the rupture propagated at an average speed of 3.1 kilometers per second 49 ° toward north east , rupturing a total of about 300 km . maximum displacement amounted to 9 meters . the focus was deeper than 10 km .
new features and functionality in windows 8 include a faster startup through uefi integration and the new " hybrid boot " mode ( which hibernates the windows kernel on shutdown to speed up the subsequent boot ) , a new lock screen with a clock and notifications , and the ability for enterprise users to create live usb versions of windows ( known as windows to go ) . windows 8 also adds native support for usb 3.0 devices , which allow for faster data transfers and improved power management with compatible devices , and hard disk 4kb advanced format support , as well as support for near field communication to facilitate sharing and communication between devices .
with the majority of nigeria 's populace in the rural areas , the major languages of communication in the country remain indigenous languages . some of the largest of these , notably yoruba and igbo , have derived standardised languages from a number of different dialects and are widely spoken by those ethnic groups . nigerian pidgin english , often known simply as ' pidgin ' or ' broken ' ( broken english ) , is also a popular lingua franca , though with varying regional influences on dialect and slang . the pidgin english or nigerian english is widely spoken within the niger delta regions , predominately in warri , sapele , port harcourt , agenebode , ewu , and benin city .
the second main principle , sola fide ( by faith alone ) , states that faith in christ is sufficient alone for eternal salvation . though argued from scripture , and hence logically consequent to sola scriptura , this is the guiding principle of the work of luther and the later reformers . because sola scriptura placed the bible as the only source of teaching , sola fide epitomises the main thrust of the teaching the reformers wanted to get back to , namely the direct , close , personal connection between christ and the believer , hence the reformers ' contention that their work was christocentric .
in 2006 , a study by behar et al . , based on what was at that time high-resolution analysis of haplogroup k ( mtdna ) , suggested that about 40 % of the current ashkenazi population is descended matrilineally from just four women , or " founder lineages , " that were " likely from a hebrew / levantine mtdna pool " originating in the middle east in the 1st and 2nd centuries ce . additionally , behar et al. suggested that the rest of ashkenazi mtdna is originated from ~ 150 women , and that most of those were also likely of middle eastern origin . in reference specifically to haplogroup k , they suggested that although it is common throughout western eurasia , " the observed global pattern of distribution renders very unlikely the possibility that the four aforementioned founder lineages entered the ashkenazi mtdna pool via gene flow from a european host population . "
wood , in the strict sense , is yielded by trees , which increase in diameter by the formation , between the existing wood and the inner bark , of new woody layers which envelop the entire stem , living branches , and roots . this process is known as secondary growth ; it is the result of cell division in the vascular cambium , a lateral meristem , and subsequent expansion of the new cells . where there are clear seasons , growth can occur in a discrete annual or seasonal pattern , leading to growth rings ; these can usually be most clearly seen on the end of a log , but are also visible on the other surfaces . if these seasons are annual these growth rings are referred to as annual rings . where there is no seasonal difference growth rings are likely to be indistinct or absent .
the order has six officials : the prelate ; the dean ; the secretary ; the registrar ; the king of arms ; and the usher . the bishop of london , a senior bishop in the church of england , serves as the order 's prelate . the dean of st paul 's is ex officio the dean of the order . the order 's king of arms is not a member of the college of arms , as are many other heraldic officers . the usher of the order is known as the gentleman usher of the purple rod ; he does not - unlike his order of the garter equivalent , the gentleman usher of the black rod - perform any duties related to the house of lords .
yet another influential philosopher who had an influence on modern philosophy was ibn tufail . his philosophical novel , hayy ibn yaqdha , translated into latin as philosophus autodidactus in 1671 , developed the themes of empiricism , tabula rasa , nature versus nurture , condition of possibility , materialism , and molyneux 's problem . european scholars and writers influenced by this novel include john locke , gottfried leibniz , melchisedech thevenot , john wallis , christiaan huygens , george keith , robert barclay , the quakers , and samuel hartlib .
beginning in the late 1950s and 1960s , architectural phenomenology emerged as an important movement in the early reaction against modernism , with architects like charles moore in the usa , christian norberg-schulz in norway , and ernesto nathan rogers and vittorio gregotti in italy , who collectively popularized an interest in a new contemporary architecture aimed at expanding human experience using historical buildings as models and precedents . postmodernism produced a style that combined contemporary building technology and cheap materials , with the aesthetics of older pre-modern and non-modern styles , from high classical architecture to popular or vernacular regional building styles . robert venturi famously defined postmodern architecture as a " decorated shed " ( an ordinary building which is functionally designed inside and embellished on the outside ) , and upheld it against modernist and brutalist " ducks " ( buildings with unnecessarily expressive tectonic forms ) .
an exception to the usual european qualification system happened in 2005 , after liverpool won the champions league the year before , but did not finish in a champions league qualification place in the premier league that season . uefa gave special dispensation for liverpool to enter the champions league , giving england five qualifiers . uefa subsequently ruled that the defending champions qualify for the competition the following year regardless of their domestic league placing . however , for those leagues with four entrants in the champions league , this meant that if the champions league winner finished outside the top four in its domestic league , it would qualify at the expense of the fourth-placed team in the league . no association can have more than four entrants in the champions league . this occurred in 2012 , when chelsea - who had won the champions league the previous year , but finished sixth in the league - qualified for the champions league in place of tottenham hotspur , who went into the europa league .
the ministry of health is responsible for developing health policy as well as managing the sns . five regional health administrations are in charge of implementing the national health policy objectives , developing guidelines and protocols and supervising health care delivery . decentralization efforts have aimed at shifting financial and management responsibility to the regional level . in practice , however , the autonomy of regional health administrations over budget setting and spending has been limited to primary care .
according to hampshire constabulary figures , southampton is currently safer than it has ever been before , with dramatic reductions in violent crime year on year for the last three years . data from the southampton safer city partnership shows there has been a reduction in all crimes in recent years and an increase in crime detection rates . according to government figures southampton has a higher crime rate than the national average . there is some controversy regarding comparative crime statisitics due to inconsistencies between different police forces recording methodologies . for example , in hampshire all reported incidents are recorded and all records then retained . however , in neighbouring dorset crimes reports withdrawn or shown to be false are not recorded , reducing apparent crime figures . in the violence against the person category , the national average is 16.7 per 1000 population while southampton is 42.4 per 1000 population . in the theft from a vehicle category , the national average is 7.6 per 1000 compared to southampton 's 28.4 per 1000 . overall , for every 1,000 people in the city , 202 crimes are recorded . hampshire constabulary 's figures for 2009 / 10 show fewer incidents of recorded crime in southampton than the previous year .

tanzania : dar es salaam was the torch 's only stop in africa , on april 13 . the relay began at the grand terminal of the tazara railway , which was china 's largest foreign aid project of the 1970s , and continued for 5 km through the old city to the benjamin mkapa national stadium in temeke , which was built with chinese aid in 2005 . the torch was lit by vice-president ali mohamed shein . about a thousand people followed the relay , waving the olympic flag . the only noted instance of protest was nobel peace prize laureate wangari maathai 's withdrawal from the list of torchbearers , in protest against human rights abuses in tibet .
the second and most dramatic boom and bust resulted from the klondike gold rush , which ended the depression that had begun with the panic of 1893 ; in a short time , seattle became a major transportation center . on july 14 , 1897 , the s.s. portland docked with its famed " ton of gold , " and seattle became the main transport and supply point for the miners in alaska and the yukon . few of those working men found lasting wealth , however ; it was seattle 's business of clothing the miners and feeding them salmon that panned out in the long run . along with seattle , other cities like everett , tacoma , port townsend , bremerton , and olympia , all in the puget sound region , became competitors for exchange , rather than mother lodes for extraction , of precious metals . the boom lasted well into the early part of the 20th century and funded many new seattle companies and products . in 1907 , 19-year-old james e. casey borrowed $ 100 from a friend and founded the american messenger company ( later ups ) . other seattle companies founded during this period include nordstrom and eddie bauer . seattle brought in the olmsted brothers landscape architecture firm to design a system of parks and boulevards .
on the indian subcontinent , the mughal empire ruled most of india in the early 18th century . the " classic period " ended with the death and defeat of emperor aurangzeb in 1707 by the rising hindu maratha empire , although the dynasty continued for another 150 years . during this period , the empire was marked by a highly centralized administration connecting the different regions . all the significant monuments of the mughals , their most visible legacy , date to this period which was characterised by the expansion of persian cultural influence in the indian subcontinent , with brilliant literary , artistic , and architectural results . the maratha empire was located in the south west of present-day india and expanded greatly under the rule of the peshwas , the prime ministers of the maratha empire . in 1761 , the maratha army lost the third battle of panipat which halted imperial expansion and the empire was then divided into a confederacy of maratha states .
kanye west began his early production career in the mid-1990s , making beats primarily for burgeoning local artists , eventually developing a style that involved speeding up vocal samples from classic soul records . his first official production credits came at the age of nineteen when he produced eight tracks on down to earth , the 1996 debut album of a chicago rapper named grav . for a time , west acted as a ghost producer for deric " d-dot " angelettie . because of his association with d-dot , west wasn 't able to release a solo album , so he formed and became a member and producer of the go-getters , a late-1990s chicago rap group composed of him , glc , timmy g , really doe , and arrowstar . his group was managed by john " monopoly " johnson , don crowley , and happy lewis under the management firm hustle period . after attending a series of promotional photo shoots and making some radio appearances , the go-getters released their first and only studio album world record holders in 1999 . the album featured other chicago-based rappers such as rhymefest , mikkey halsted , miss criss , and shayla g. meanwhile , the production was handled by west , arrowstar , boogz , and brian " all day " miller .
no evidence has yet been found of a jewish presence in antiquity in germany beyond its roman border , nor in eastern europe . in gaul and germany itself , with the possible exception of trier and cologne , the archeological evidence suggests at most a fleeting presence of very few jews , primarily itinerant traders or artisans . a substantial jewish population emerged in northern gaul by the middle ages , but jewish communities existed in 465 ce in brittany , in 524 ce in valence , and in 533 ce in orleans . throughout this period and into the early middle ages , some jews assimilated into the dominant greek and latin cultures , mostly through conversion to christianity . [ better source needed ] king dagobert i of the franks expelled the jews from his merovingian kingdom in 629 . jews in former roman territories faced new challenges as harsher anti-jewish church rulings were enforced .
eric p. hamp in his 2012 indo-european family tree , groups the armenian language along with greek and ancient macedonian ( " helleno-macedonian " ) in the pontic indo-european ( also called helleno-armenian ) subgroup . in hamp 's view the homeland of this subgroup is the northeast coast of the black sea and its hinterlands . he assumes that they migrated from there southeast through the caucasus with the armenians remaining after batumi while the pre-greeks proceeded westwards along the southern coast of the black sea .
being identified as either " black " or " white " in australia during the 19th and early 20th centuries was critical in one 's employment and social prospects . various state-based aboriginal protection boards were established which had virtually complete control over the lives of indigenous australians - where they lived , their employment , marriage , education and included the power to separate children from their parents . aborigines were not allowed to vote and were often confined to reserves and forced into low paid or effectively slave labour . the social position of mixed-race or " half-caste " individuals varied over time . a 1913 report by sir baldwin spencer states that :
in the 1990s rhino records issued a series of boxed sets of 78 rpm reissues of early rock and roll hits , intended for owners of vintage jukeboxes . this was a disaster because rhino did not warn customers that their records were made of vinyl , and that the vintage 78 rpm juke boxes were designed with heavy tone arms and steel needles to play the hard shellac records of their time . this failure to warn customers gave the rhino 78 records a bad reputation , [ citation needed ] as they were destroyed by old juke boxes and old record players but played very well on newer 78-capable turntables with modern lightweight tone arms and jewel needles .
kuaiji commandery was the initial power base for xiang liang and xiang yu 's rebellion against the qin empire which initially succeeded in restoring the kingdom of chu but eventually fell to the han . under the later han , control of the area returned to the settlement below mount kuaiji but authority over the minyue hinterland was nominal at best and its yue inhabitants largely retained their own political and social structures .
capitalisation in english , in terms of the general orthographic rules independent of context ( e.g. title vs. heading vs. text ) , is universally standardized for formal writing . ( informal communication , such as texting , instant messaging or a handwritten sticky note , may not bother , but that is because its users usually do not expect it to be formal . ) in english , capital letters are used as the first letter of a sentence , a proper noun , or a proper adjective . there are a few pairs of words of different meanings whose only difference is capitalisation of the first letter . the names of the days of the week and the names of the months are also capitalised , as are the first-person pronoun " i " and the interjection " o " ( although the latter is uncommon in modern usage , with " oh " being preferred ) . other words normally start with a lower-case letter . there are , however , situations where further capitalisation may be used to give added emphasis , for example in headings and titles ( see below ) . in some traditional forms of poetry , capitalisation has conventionally been used as a marker to indicate the beginning of a line of verse independent of any grammatical feature .
darwin continued to research and extensively revise his theory while focusing on his main work of publishing the scientific results of the beagle voyage . he tentatively wrote of his ideas to lyell in january 1842 ; then in june he roughed out a 35-page " pencil sketch " of his theory . darwin began correspondence about his theorising with the botanist joseph dalton hooker in january 1844 , and by july had rounded out his " sketch " into a 230-page " essay , " to be expanded with his research results and published if he died prematurely .
the alaska native language center at the university of alaska fairbanks claims that at least 20 alaskan native languages exist and there are also some languages with different dialects . most of alaska 's native languages belong to either the eskimo-aleut or na-dene language families however some languages are thought to be isolates ( e.g. haida ) or have not yet been classified ( e.g. tsimshianic ) . as of 2014 [ update ] nearly all of alaska 's native languages were classified as either threatened , shifting , moribund , nearly extinct , or dormant languages .

like most germanic languages , dutch forms noun compounds , where the first noun modifies the category given by the second ( hondenhok = doghouse ) . unlike english , where newer compounds or combinations of longer nouns are often written in open form with separating spaces , dutch ( like the other germanic languages ) either uses the closed form without spaces ( boomhuis = tree house ) or inserts a hyphen ( vvd-coryfee = outstanding member of the vvd , a political party ) . like german , dutch allows arbitrarily long compounds , but the longer they get , the less frequent they tend to be .
the brain is an organ that serves as the center of the nervous system in all vertebrate and most invertebrate animals . only a few invertebrates such as sponges , jellyfish , adult sea squirts and starfish do not have a brain ; diffuse or localised nerve nets are present instead . the brain is located in the head , usually close to the primary sensory organs for such senses as vision , hearing , balance , taste , and smell . the brain is the most complex organ in a vertebrate 's body . in a typical human , the cerebral cortex ( the largest part ) is estimated to contain 15-33 billion neurons , each connected by synapses to several thousand other neurons . these neurons communicate with one another by means of long protoplasmic fibers called axons , which carry trains of signal pulses called action potentials to distant parts of the brain or body targeting specific recipient cells .

during the rule of the succeeding hanoverian dynasty , power was gradually exercised more by parliament and the government . the first hanoverian monarch , george i , relied on his ministers to a greater extent than did previous monarchs . later hanoverian monarchs attempted to restore royal control over legislation : george iii and george iv both openly opposed catholic emancipation and asserted that to grant assent to a catholic emancipation bill would violate the coronation oath , which required the sovereign to preserve and protect the established church of england from papal domination and would grant rights to individuals who were in league with a foreign power which did not recognise their legitimacy . however , george iv reluctantly granted his assent upon the advice of his ministers . thus , as the concept of ministerial responsibility has evolved , the power to withhold royal assent has fallen into disuse , both in the united kingdom and in the other commonwealth realms .

unicode was designed to provide code-point-by-code-point round-trip format conversion to and from any preexisting character encodings , so that text files in older character sets can be naively converted to unicode , and then back and get back the same file . that has meant that inconsistent legacy architectures , such as combining diacritics and precomposed characters , both exist in unicode , giving more than one method of representing some text . this is most pronounced in the three different encoding forms for korean hangul . since version 3.0 , any precomposed characters that can be represented by a combining sequence of already existing characters can no longer be added to the standard in order to preserve interoperability between software using different versions of unicode .

jehovah 's witnesses have been accused of having policies and culture that help to conceal cases of sexual abuse within the organization . the religion has been criticized for its " two witness rule " for church discipline , based on its application of scriptures at deuteronomy 19 : 15 and matthew 18 : 15-17 , which requires sexual abuse to be substantiated by secondary evidence if the accused person denies any wrongdoing . in cases where corroboration is lacking , the watch tower society 's instruction is that " the elders will leave the matter in jehovah 's hands . " a former member of the church 's headquarters staff , barbara anderson , says the policy effectively requires that there be another witness to an act of molestation , " which is an impossibility . " anderson says the policies " protect pedophiles rather than protect the children . " jehovah 's witnesses maintain that they have a strong policy to protect children , adding that the best way to protect children is by educating parents ; they also state that they do not sponsor activities that separate children from parents .

capacitors may catastrophically fail when subjected to voltages or currents beyond their rating , or as they reach their normal end of life . dielectric or metal interconnection failures may create arcing that vaporizes the dielectric fluid , resulting in case bulging , rupture , or even an explosion . capacitors used in rf or sustained high-current applications can overheat , especially in the center of the capacitor rolls . capacitors used within high-energy capacitor banks can violently explode when a short in one capacitor causes sudden dumping of energy stored in the rest of the bank into the failing unit . high voltage vacuum capacitors can generate soft x-rays even during normal operation . proper containment , fusing , and preventive maintenance can help to minimize these hazards .
because it was designated as the national capital , many structures were built around that time . even today , some of them still remain which are open to tourists .
since the early days of rail transport in the united states , philadelphia has served as hub for several major rail companies , particularly the pennsylvania railroad and the reading railroad . the pennsylvania railroad first operated broad street station , then 30th street station and suburban station , and the reading railroad operated out of reading terminal , now part of the pennsylvania convention center . the two companies also operated competing commuter rail systems in the area , known collectively as the regional rail system . the two systems today , for the most part still intact but now connected , operate as a single system under the control of the septa , the regional transit authority . additionally , the patco speedline subway system and nj transit 's atlantic city line operate successor services to southern new jersey .
a wrestler can win by knockout ( sometimes referred to as a referee stoppage ) if they do not resort to submission holds , but stills pummels their opponent to the point that they are unconscious or are unable to intelligently defend themselves . to check for a knockout in this manner , a referee will wave their hand in front of the wrestler 's face ; if the wrestler does not react in any way , the referee will award the victory to the other wrestler . if all the active wrestlers in a match are down inside the ring at the same time , the referee will begin a count ( usually ten seconds , twenty in japan ) . if nobody rises to their feet by the end of the count , the match is ruled a draw . any participant who stands up in time will end the count for everyone else . in a last man standing match , this form of a knockout is the only way that the match can end , so the referee will count when one or more wrestlers are down , and one wrestler standing up before the 10-count doesn 't stop the count for another wrestler who is still down .
at the outset of the franco-prussian war , 462,000 german soldiers concentrated on the french frontier while only 270,000 french soldiers could be moved to face them , the french army having lost 100,000 stragglers before a shot was fired through poor planning and administration . this was partly due to the peacetime organisations of the armies . each prussian corps was based within a kreis ( literally " circle " ) around the chief city in an area . reservists rarely lived more than a day 's travel from their regiment 's depot . by contrast , french regiments generally served far from their depots , which in turn were not in the areas of france from which their soldiers were drawn . reservists often faced several days ' journey to report to their depots , and then another long journey to join their regiments . large numbers of reservists choked railway stations , vainly seeking rations and orders .
in march 2013 it was announced that russian is now the second-most used language on the internet after english . people use the russian language on 5.9 % of all websites , slightly ahead of german and far behind english ( 54.7 % ) . russian is used not only on 89.8 % of .ru sites , but also on 88.7 % of sites with the former soviet union domain .su. the websites of former soviet union nations also use high levels of russian : 79.0 % in ukraine , 86.9 % in belarus , 84.0 % in kazakhstan , 79.6 % in uzbekistan , 75.9 % in kyrgyzstan and 81.8 % in tajikistan . however , russian is the sixth-most used language on the top 1,000 sites , behind english , chinese , french , german and japanese .
groove recordings , first designed in the final quarter of the 19th century , held a predominant position for nearly a century - withstanding competition from reel-to-reel tape , the 8-track cartridge , and the compact cassette . in 1988 , the compact disc surpassed the gramophone record in unit sales . vinyl records experienced a sudden decline in popularity between 1988 and 1991 , when the major label distributors restricted their return policies , which retailers had been relying on to maintain and swap out stocks of relatively unpopular titles . first the distributors began charging retailers more for new product if they returned unsold vinyl , and then they stopped providing any credit at all for returns . retailers , fearing they would be stuck with anything they ordered , only ordered proven , popular titles that they knew would sell , and devoted more shelf space to cds and cassettes . record companies also deleted many vinyl titles from production and distribution , further undermining the availability of the format and leading to the closure of pressing plants . this rapid decline in the availability of records accelerated the format 's decline in popularity , and is seen by some as a deliberate ploy to make consumers switch to cds , which were more profitable for the record companies .
as the ottoman empire gradually shrank in size , some 7-9 million turkish-muslims from its former territories in the caucasus , crimea , balkans , and the mediterranean islands migrated to anatolia and eastern thrace . after the empire lost the balkan wars ( 1912-13 ) , it lost all its balkan territories except east thrace ( european turkey ) . this resulted in around 400,000 muslims fleeing with the retreating ottoman armies ( with many dying from cholera brought by the soldiers ) , and with some 400,000 non-muslims fleeing territory still under ottoman rule . justin mccarthy estimates that during the period 1821 to 1922 several million muslims died in the balkans , with the expulsion of a similar number .
a typical pommel horse exercise involves both single leg and double leg work . single leg skills are generally found in the form of scissors , an element often done on the pommels . double leg work however , is the main staple of this event . the gymnast swings both legs in a circular motion ( clockwise or counterclockwise depending on preference ) and performs such skills on all parts of the apparatus . to make the exercise more challenging , gymnasts will often include variations on a typical circling skill by turning ( moores and spindles ) or by straddling their legs ( flares ) . routines end when the gymnast performs a dismount , either by swinging his body over the horse , or landing after a handstand . this requires back muscles to do any sort of skill . from handstands being easy to back or front flips being a little difficult .
from 1842 onwards , chopin showed signs of serious illness . after a solo recital in paris on 21 february 1842 , he wrote to grzymała : " i have to lie in bed all day long , my mouth and tonsils are aching so much . " he was forced by illness to decline a written invitation from alkan to participate in a repeat performance of the beethoven seventh symphony arrangement at erard 's on 1 march 1843 . late in 1844 , charles halle visited chopin and found him " hardly able to move , bent like a half-opened penknife and evidently in great pain , " although his spirits returned when he started to play the piano for his visitor . chopin 's health continued to deteriorate , particularly from this time onwards . modern research suggests that apart from any other illnesses , he may also have suffered from temporal lobe epilepsy .
just as lee explores jem 's development in coming to grips with a racist and unjust society , scout realizes what being female means , and several female characters influence her development . scout 's primary identification with her father and older brother allows her to describe the variety and depth of female characters in the novel both as one of them and as an outsider . scout 's primary female models are calpurnia and her neighbor miss maudie , both of whom are strong willed , independent , and protective . mayella ewell also has an influence ; scout watches her destroy an innocent man in order to hide her desire for him . the female characters who comment the most on scout 's lack of willingness to adhere to a more feminine role are also those who promote the most racist and classist points of view . for example , mrs. dubose chastises scout for not wearing a dress and camisole , and indicates she is ruining the family name by not doing so , in addition to insulting atticus ' intentions to defend tom robinson . by balancing the masculine influences of atticus and jem with the feminine influences of calpurnia and miss maudie , one scholar writes , " lee gradually demonstrates that scout is becoming a feminist in the south , for with the use of first-person narration , she indicates that scout / jean louise still maintains the ambivalence about being a southern lady she possessed as a child . "
in february 1939 , he received news from his sisters that his mother was dying . on 10 february 1939 , pope pius xi died . roncalli was unable to see his mother for the end as the death of a pontiff meant that he would have to stay at his post until the election of a new pontiff . unfortunately , she died on 20 february 1939 , during the nine days of mourning for the late pius xi . he was sent a letter by cardinal eugenio pacelli , and roncalli later recalled that it was probably the last letter pacelli sent until his election as pope pius xii on 2 march 1939 . roncalli expressed happiness that pacelli was elected , and , on radio , listened to the coronation of the new pontiff .
in the first centuries ad , political and administrative subdivisions began to emerge in estonia . two larger subdivisions appeared : the province ( estonian : kihelkond ) and the land ( estonian : maakond ) . several elderships or villages made up a province . nearly all provinces had at least one fortress . the king or other highest administrative official elder directed the defense of the local area . by the thirteenth century estonia consisted of the following provinces : revala , harjumaa , saaremaa , hiiumaa , laanemaa , alempois , sakala , ugandi , jogentagana , soopoolitse , vaiga , mohu , nurmekund , jarvamaa and virumaa .
by 1916 , when millions of europeans were becoming casualties of imperial war in the trenches of eastern and western europe over " the eastern question , " arnold j. toynbee , hegelesque historian of civilization at large , was becoming metaphysical about the near east . geography alone was not a sufficient explanation of the terms , he believed . if the ottoman empire had been a sick man , then :
hellenistic poets now sought patronage from kings , and wrote works in their honor . the scholars at the libraries in alexandria and pergamon focused on the collection , cataloging , and literary criticism of classical athenian works and ancient greek myths . the poet-critic callimachus , a staunch elitist , wrote hymns equating ptolemy ii to zeus and apollo . he promoted short poetic forms such as the epigram , epyllion and the iambic and attacked epic as base and common ( " big book , big evil " was his doctrine ) . he also wrote a massive catalog of the holdings of the library of alexandria , the famous pinakes . callimachus was extremely influential in his time and also for the development of augustan poetry . another poet , apollonius of rhodes , attempted to revive the epic for the hellenistic world with his argonautica . he had been a student of callimachus and later became chief librarian ( prostates ) of the library of alexandria , apollonius and callimachus spent much of their careers feuding with each other . pastoral poetry also thrived during the hellenistic era , theocritus was a major poet who popularized the genre .
olin has a network of more than 16,000 alumni worldwide . over the last several years , the school 's endowment has increased to $ 213 million ( 2004 ) and annual gifts average $ 12 million per year . [ citation needed ] simon hall was opened in 1986 after a donation from john e. simon . on may 2 , 2014 , the $ 90 million conjoined knight and bauer halls were dedicated , following a $ 15 million gift from charles f. knight and joanne knight and a $ 10 million gift from george and carol bauer through the bauer foundation .
much of the great plains became open range , or rangeland where cattle roamed free , hosting ranching operations where anyone was theoretically free to run cattle . in the spring and fall , ranchers held roundups where their cowboys branded new calves , treated animals and sorted the cattle for sale . such ranching began in texas and gradually moved northward . in 1866-95 , cowboys herded 10 million cattle north to rail heads such as dodge city , kansas and ogallala , nebraska ; from there , cattle were shipped eastward .
in 1849 , horne 's began operations and soon became a leading pittsburgh department store . in 1879 , it opened a seven-story landmark which was the first department store in the city 's downtown . in 1972 , associated dry goods acquired horne 's , and adg expanded operations of horne 's to several stores in suburban malls throughout the pittsburgh region as well as in erie , pennsylvania and northeast ohio . in december 1986 , horne 's was acquired by a local investor group following adg 's acquisition by may department stores . by 1994 , federated department stores acquired the remaining ten horne 's stores and merged them with its lazarus division , completely ceasing all operations of any store under the horne 's name .
to the west , settlements in the zagros basin experience lower temperatures , severe winters with below zero average daily temperatures and heavy snowfall . the eastern and central basins are arid , with less than 200 mm ( 7.9 in ) of rain , and have occasional deserts . average summer temperatures rarely exceed 38 ° c ( 100.4 ° f ) . the coastal plains of the persian gulf and gulf of oman in southern iran have mild winters , and very humid and hot summers . the annual precipitation ranges from 135 to 355 mm ( 5.3 to 14.0 in ) .
brass , which is an alloy of copper and zinc , has been used since at least the 10th century bc in judea and by the 7th century bc in ancient greece . zinc metal was not produced on a large scale until the 12th century in india and was unknown to europe until the end of the 16th century . the mines of rajasthan have given definite evidence of zinc production going back to the 6th century bc . to date , the oldest evidence of pure zinc comes from zawar , in rajasthan , as early as the 9th century ad when a distillation process was employed to make pure zinc . alchemists burned zinc in air to form what they called " philosopher 's wool " or " white snow . "
a second new haven gastronomical claim to fame is louis ' lunch , which is located in a small brick building on crown street and has been serving fast food since 1895 . though fiercely debated , the restaurant 's founder louis lassen is credited by the library of congress with inventing the hamburger and steak sandwich . louis ' lunch broils hamburgers , steak sandwiches and hot dogs vertically in original antique 1898 cast iron stoves using gridirons , patented by local resident luigi pieragostini in 1939 , that hold the meat in place while it cooks .
in greece carnival is also known as the apokries ( greek : αποκριες , " saying goodbye to meat " ) , or the season of the " opening of the triodion , " so named after the liturgical book used by the church from then until holy week . one of the season 's high points is tsiknopempti , when celebrants enjoy roast beef dinners ; the ritual is repeated the following sunday . the following week , the last before lent , is called tyrine ( greek : τυρινη , " cheese [ week ] " ) because meat is forbidden , although dairy products are not . lent begins on " clean monday , " the day after " cheese sunday . " throughout the carnival season , people disguise themselves as maskarades ( " masqueraders " ) and engage in pranks and revelry .
with high cost of labor in developed countries , production automation has become increasingly popular . rather than being assembled by hand , mosaics designed using computer aided design ( cad ) software can be assembled by a robot . production can be greater than 10 times faster with higher accuracy . but these " computer " mosaics have a different look than hand-made " artisanal " mosaics . with robotic production , colored tiles are loaded into buffers , and then the robot picks and places tiles individually according to a command file from the design software .
the sociology of culture grew from the intersection between sociology ( as shaped by early theorists like marx , durkheim , and weber ) with the growing discipline of anthropology , where in researchers pioneered ethnographic strategies for describing and analyzing a variety of cultures around the world . part of the legacy of the early development of the field lingers in the methods ( much of cultural sociological research is qualitative ) , in the theories ( a variety of critical approaches to sociology are central to current research communities ) , and in the substantive focus of the field . for instance , relationships between popular culture , political control , and social class were early and lasting concerns in the field .
the dipole component of the magnetic field at the magnetic equator of neptune is about 14 microteslas ( 0.14 g ) . the dipole magnetic moment of neptune is about 2.2 × 1017 t · m3 ( 14 μt · rn3 , where rn is the radius of neptune ) . neptune 's magnetic field has a complex geometry that includes relatively large contributions from non-dipolar components , including a strong quadrupole moment that may exceed the dipole moment in strength . by contrast , earth , jupiter and saturn have only relatively small quadrupole moments , and their fields are less tilted from the polar axis . the large quadrupole moment of neptune may be the result of offset from the planet 's centre and geometrical constraints of the field 's dynamo generator .
to the southwest , the principality of halych had developed trade relations with its polish , hungarian and lithuanian neighbours and emerged as the local successor to kievan rus ' . in 1199 , prince roman mstislavich united the two previously separate principalities . in 1202 he conquered kiev , and assumed the title of grand duke of kievan rus ' , which was held by the rulers of vladimir-suzdal since 1169 . his son , prince daniil ( r . 1238-1264 ) looked for support from the west . he accepted a crown as a " rex rusiae " ( " king of russia " ) from the roman papacy , apparently doing so without breaking with constantinople . in 1370 , the patriarch of the eastern orthodox church in constantinople granted the king of poland a metropolitan for his russian subjects . lithuanian rulers also requested and received a metropolitan for novagrudok shortly afterwards . cyprian , a candidate pushed by the lithuanian rulers , became metropolitan of kiev in 1375 and metropolitan of moscow in 1382 ; this way the church in the russian countries was reunited for some time . in 1439 , kiev became the seat of a separate " metropolitan of kiev , galich and all rus ' " for all greek orthodox christians under polish-lithuanian rule .
british post-punk entered the 1980s with support from members of the critical community - american critic greil marcus characterised " britain 's postpunk pop avant-garde " in a 1980 rolling stone article as " sparked by a tension , humour and sense of paradox plainly unique in present day pop music " - as well as media figures such as bbc dj john peel , while several groups , such as pil and joy division , achieved some success in the popular charts . the network of supportive record labels that included industrial , fast , e.g. , mute , axis / 4ad and glass continued to facilitate a large output of music , by artists such as the raincoats , essential logic , killing joke , the teardrop explodes , and the psychedelic furs .
the early settlement was often subject to attack from sea and land , including periodic assaults from spain and france ( both of whom contested england 's claims to the region ) , and pirates . these were combined with raids by native americans , who tried to protect themselves from so-called european " settlers , " who in turn wanted to expand the settlement . the heart of the city was fortified according to a 1704 plan by governor johnson . except those fronting cooper river , the walls were largely removed during the 1720s .
in the early 1980s , downtown manhattan 's no wave scene transitioned from its abrasive origins into a more dance-oriented sound , with compilations such as ze 's mutant disco ( 1981 ) highlighting a newly playful sensibility borne out of the city 's clash of hip hop , disco and punk styles , as well as dub reggae and world music influences . artists such as liquid liquid , the b-52s , cristina , arthur russell , james white and the blacks and lizzy mercier descloux pursued a formula described by luc sante as " anything at all + disco bottom . " the decadent parties and art installations of venues such as club 57 and the mudd club became cultural hubs for musicians and visual artists alike , with figures such as jean-michel basquiat , keith haring and michael holman frequenting the scene . other no wave-indebted groups such as swans , glenn branca , the lounge lizards , bush tetras and sonic youth instead continued exploring the early scene 's forays into noise and more abrasive territory .
several americans , especially benjamin franklin and thomas jefferson , played a major role in bringing enlightenment ideas to the new world and in influencing british and french thinkers . franklin was influential for his political activism and for his advances in physics . the cultural exchange during the age of enlightenment ran in both directions across the atlantic . thinkers such as paine , locke , and rousseau all take native american cultural practices as examples of natural freedom . the americans closely followed english and scottish political ideas , as well as some french thinkers such as montesquieu . as deists , they were influenced by ideas of john toland ( 1670-1722 ) and matthew tindal ( 1656-1733 ) . during the enlightenment there was a great emphasis upon liberty , democracy , republicanism and religious tolerance . attempts to reconcile science and religion resulted in a widespread rejection of prophecy , miracle and revealed religion in preference for deism - especially by thomas paine in the age of reason and by thomas jefferson in his short jefferson bible - from which all supernatural aspects were removed .
assure / dissuade / deter is a mission set derived from the air force 's readiness to carry out the nuclear strike operations mission as well as from specific actions taken to assure allies as a part of extended deterrence . dissuading others from acquiring or proliferating wmd , and the means to deliver them , contributes to promoting security and is also an integral part of this mission . moreover , different deterrence strategies are required to deter various adversaries , whether they are a nation state , or non-state / transnational actor . the air force maintains and presents credible deterrent capabilities through successful visible demonstrations and exercises which assure allies , dissuade proliferation , deter potential adversaries from actions that threaten us national security or the populations and deployed military forces of the us , its allies and friends .
in 1808 , napoleon and czar alexander met at the congress of erfurt to preserve the russo-french alliance . the leaders had a friendly personal relationship after their first meeting at tilsit in 1807 . by 1811 , however , tensions had increased and alexander was under pressure from the russian nobility to break off the alliance . a major strain on the relationship between the two nations became the regular violations of the continental system by the russians , which led napoleon to threaten alexander with serious consequences if he formed an alliance with britain .
russian is a slavic language of the indo-european family . it is a lineal descendant of the language used in kievan rus ' . from the point of view of the spoken language , its closest relatives are ukrainian , belarusian , and rusyn , the other three languages in the east slavic group . in many places in eastern and southern ukraine and throughout belarus , these languages are spoken interchangeably , and in certain areas traditional bilingualism resulted in language mixtures , e.g. surzhyk in eastern ukraine and trasianka in belarus . an east slavic old novgorod dialect , although vanished during the 15th or 16th century , is sometimes considered to have played a significant role in the formation of modern russian . also russian has notable lexical similarities with bulgarian due to a common church slavonic influence on both languages , as well as because of later interaction in the 19th-20th centuries , although bulgarian grammar differs markedly from russian . in the 19th century , the language was often called " great russian " to distinguish it from belarusian , then called " white russian " and ukrainian , then called " little russian . "
from 1974 ( the creation of the british colony of tuvalu ) until independence , the legislative body of tuvalu was called the house of the assembly or fale i fono . following independence in october 1978 the house of the assembly was renamed the parliament of tuvalu or palamene o tuvalu . the unicameral parliament has 15 members with elections held every four years . the members of parliament select the prime minister ( who is the head of government ) and the speaker of parliament . the ministers that form the cabinet are appointed by the governor general on the advice of the prime minister .
however many early history books like the islamic conquest of syria fatuhusham by al-imam al-waqidi state that after the conversion to islam muawiyah 's father abu sufyan ibn harb and his brothers yazid ibn abi sufyan were appointed as commanders in the muslim armies by muhammad . muawiyah , abu sufyan ibn harb , yazid ibn abi sufyan and hind bint utbah fought in the battle of yarmouk . the defeat of the byzantine emperor heraclius at the battle of yarmouk opened the way for the muslim expansion into jerusalem and syria .
the prussian army was controlled by the general staff , under field marshal helmuth von moltke . the prussian army was unique in europe for having the only such organisation in existence , whose purpose in peacetime was to prepare the overall war strategy , and in wartime to direct operational movement and organise logistics and communications . the officers of the general staff were hand-picked from the prussian kriegsakademie ( war academy ) . moltke embraced new technology , particularly the railroad and telegraph , to coordinate and accelerate mobilisation of large forces .
early computing machines had fixed programs . changing its function required the re-wiring and re-structuring of the machine . with the proposal of the stored-program computer this changed . a stored-program computer includes by design an instruction set and can store in memory a set of instructions ( a program ) that details the computation . the theoretical basis for the stored-program computer was laid by alan turing in his 1936 paper . in 1945 turing joined the national physical laboratory and began work on developing an electronic stored-program digital computer . his 1945 report " proposed electronic calculator ' was the first specification for such a device . john von neumann at the university of pennsylvania , also circulated his first draft of a report on the edvac in 1945 .
the state is also a host to a large population of birds which include endemic species and migratory species : greater roadrunner geococcyx californianus , cactus wren campylorhynchus brunneicapillus , mexican jay aphelocoma ultramarina , steller 's jay cyanocitta stelleri , acorn woodpecker melanerpes formicivorus , canyon towhee pipilo fuscus , mourning dove zenaida macroura , broad-billed hummingbird cynanthus latirostris , montezuma quail cyrtonyx montezumae , mountain trogon trogon mexicanus , turkey vulture cathartes aura , and golden eagle aquila chrysaetos . trogon mexicanus is an endemic species found in the mountains in mexico ; it is considered an endangered species [ citation needed ] and has symbolic significance to mexicans .
the united states has become essentially a two-party system . since a conservative ( such as the republican party ) and liberal ( such as the democratic party ) party has usually been the status quo within american politics . the first parties were called federalist and republican , followed by a brief period of republican dominance before a split occurred between national republicans and democratic republicans . the former became the whig party and the latter became the democratic party . the whigs survived only for two decades before they split over the spread of slavery , those opposed becoming members of the new republican party , as did anti-slavery members of the democratic party . third parties ( such as the libertarian party ) often receive little support and are very rarely the victors in elections . despite this , there have been several examples of third parties siphoning votes from major parties that were expected to win ( such as theodore roosevelt in the election of 1912 and george wallace in the election of 1968 ) . as third party movements have learned , the electoral college 's requirement of a nationally distributed majority makes it difficult for third parties to succeed . thus , such parties rarely win many electoral votes , although their popular support within a state may tip it toward one party or the other . wallace had weak support outside the south . more generally , parties with a broad base of support across regions or among economic and other interest groups , have a great chance of winning the necessary plurality in the u.s. ' s largely single-member district , winner-take-all elections . the tremendous land area and large population of the country are formidable challenges to political parties with a narrow appeal .
saint-barthelemy has a marine nature reserve , known as the reserve naturelle that covers 1.200 ha , and is divided into 5 zones all around the island to form a network of protected areas . the reserve includes the bays of grand cul de sac , colombier , marigot , petit cul de sac , petite anse as well as waters around offshore rocks such as les gross islets , pain de sucre , tortue and forchue . the reserve is designed to protect the islands coral reefs , seagrass and endangered marine species including sea turtles . the reserve has two levels of protection , the yellow zones of protection where certain non-extractive activities , like snorkeling and boating , are allowed and the red zones of high protection where most activities including scuba are restricted in order to protect or recover marine life . anchoring is prohibited in the reserve and mooring buoys are in place in some of the protected bays like colombier
glacial bodies larger than 50,000 km2 ( 19,000 sq mi ) are called ice sheets or continental glaciers . several kilometers deep , they obscure the underlying topography . only nunataks protrude from their surfaces . the only extant ice sheets are the two that cover most of antarctica and greenland . they contain vast quantities of fresh water , enough that if both melted , global sea levels would rise by over 70 m ( 230 ft ) . portions of an ice sheet or cap that extend into water are called ice shelves ; they tend to be thin with limited slopes and reduced velocities . narrow , fast-moving sections of an ice sheet are called ice streams . in antarctica , many ice streams drain into large ice shelves . some drain directly into the sea , often with an ice tongue , like mertz glacier .
miami is also considered a " hot spot " for dance music , freestyle , a style of dance music popular in the 80 's and 90 's heavily influenced by electro , hip-hop , and disco . many popular freestyle acts such as pretty tony , debbie deb , stevie b , and expose , originated in miami . indie / folk acts cat power and iron & wine are based in the city , while alternative hip hop artist sage francis , electro artist uffie , and the electroclash duo avenue d were born in miami , but musically based elsewhere . also , ska punk band against all authority is from miami , and rock / metal bands nonpoint and marilyn manson each formed in neighboring fort lauderdale . cuban american female recording artist , ana cristina , was born in miami in 1985 .
even the zhonghua zihai does not include characters in the chinese family of scripts created to represent non-chinese languages . characters formed by chinese principles in other languages include the roughly 1,500 japanese-made kokuji given in the kokuji no jiten , the korean-made gukja , the over 10,000 sawndip characters still in use in guangxi , and the almost 20,000 nom characters formerly used in vietnam . [ citation needed ] more divergent descendents of chinese script include tangut script , which created over 5,000 characters with similar strokes but different formation principles to chinese characters .
the country was controlled by a revolutionary council until 1984 . the first multi-party elections were held in 1994 . an army uprising in may 1998 led to the guinea-bissau civil war and the president 's ousting in june 1999 . elections were held again in 2000 , and kumba iala was elected president .
during the second world war , general dornberger was the military head of the army 's rocket program , zanssen became the commandant of the peenemunde army rocket centre , and von braun was the technical director of the ballistic missile program . they would lead the team that built the aggregate-4 ( a-4 ) rocket , which became the first vehicle to reach outer space during its test flight program in 1942 and 1943 . by 1943 , germany began mass-producing the a-4 as the vergeltungswaffe 2 ( " vengeance weapon " 2 , or more commonly , v2 ) , a ballistic missile with a 320 kilometers ( 200 mi ) range carrying a 1,130 kilograms ( 2,490 lb ) warhead at 4,000 kilometers per hour ( 2,500 mph ) . its supersonic speed meant there was no defense against it , and radar detection provided little warning . germany used the weapon to bombard southern england and parts of allied-liberated western europe from 1944 until 1945 . after the war , the v-2 became the basis of early american and soviet rocket designs .

in the 20th century , russian was mandatorily taught in the schools of the members of the old warsaw pact and in other countries that used to be satellites of the ussr . in particular , these countries include poland , bulgaria , the czech republic , slovakia , hungary , albania , former east germany and cuba . however , younger generations are usually not fluent in it , because russian is no longer mandatory in the school system . according to the eurobarometer 2005 survey , though , fluency in russian remains fairly high ( 20-40 % ) in some countries , in particular those where the people speak a slavic language and thereby have an edge in learning russian ( namely , poland , czech republic , slovakia , and bulgaria ) .
st. barthelemy has a small airport known as gustaf iii airport on the north coast of the island that is served by small regional commercial aircraft and charters . the nearest airport with a runway length sufficient to land a typical commercial jet airliner is on the neighboring island of sint maarten : princess juliana international airport , which acts as a hub , providing connecting flights with regional carriers to st. barthelemy . several international airlines and domestic caribbean airlines operate in this sector .
the establishment of indian drugs and pharmaceuticals limited ( idpl ) , a public sector undertaking , in 1961 was followed over the decades by many national and global companies opening manufacturing and research facilities in the city . as of 2010 [ update ] , the city manufactured one third of india 's bulk drugs and 16 % of biotechnology products , contributing to its reputation as " india 's pharmaceutical capital " and the " genome valley of india .

there is disagreement about the origin of the term , but general consensus that " cardinalis " from the word cardo ( meaning ' pivot ' or ' hinge ' ) was first used in late antiquity to designate a bishop or priest who was incorporated into a church for which he had not originally been ordained . in rome the first persons to be called cardinals were the deacons of the seven regions of the city at the beginning of the 6th century , when the word began to mean " principal , " " eminent , " or " superior . " the name was also given to the senior priest in each of the " title " churches ( the parish churches ) of rome and to the bishops of the seven sees surrounding the city . by the 8th century the roman cardinals constituted a privileged class among the roman clergy . they took part in the administration of the church of rome and in the papal liturgy . by decree of a synod of 769 , only a cardinal was eligible to become pope . in 1059 , during the pontificate of nicholas ii , cardinals were given the right to elect the pope under the papal bull in nomine domini . for a time this power was assigned exclusively to the cardinal bishops , but the third lateran council in 1179 gave back the right to the whole body of cardinals . cardinals were granted the privilege of wearing the red hat by pope innocent iv in 1244 .

at the end of the 1980s , estonians perceived their demographic change as a national catastrophe . this was a result of the migration policies essential to the soviet nationalisation programme aiming to russify estonia - administrative and military immigration of non-estonians from the ussr coupled with the deportation of estonians to the ussr . in the decade following the reconstitution of independence , large-scale emigration by ethnic russians and the removal of the russian military bases in 1994 caused the proportion of ethnic estonians in estonia to increase from 61 % to 69 % in 2006 .
the first department stores lane crawford was opened in 1850 by scots thomas ash lane and ninian crawford on des voeux road , hong kong island . at the beginning , the store mainly catered visiting ships ' crews as well as british navy staff and their families . in 1900 , the first ethnic-chinese owned sincere department store was opened by ma ying piu , who returned from australia and inspired by david jones . in 1907 , another former hong kong expatriate in australia , the kwok 's family , returned to hong kong and founded wing on .
the largest expansion of comprehensive schools in 1965 resulted from a policy decision taken in 1965 by anthony crosland , secretary of state for education in the 1964-1970 labour government . the policy decision was implemented by circular 10 / 65 , an instruction to local education authorities to plan for conversion . students sat the 11 + examination in their last year of primary education and were sent to one of a secondary modern , secondary technical or grammar school depending on their perceived ability . secondary technical schools were never widely implemented and for 20 years there was a virtual bipartite system which saw fierce competition for the available grammar school places , which varied between 15 % and 25 % of total secondary places , depending on location .

once at golgotha , jesus was offered wine mixed with gall to drink . matthew 's and mark 's gospels record that he refused this . he was then crucified and hung between two convicted thieves . according to some translations from the original greek , the thieves may have been bandits or jewish rebels . according to mark 's gospel , he endured the torment of crucifixion for some six hours from the third hour , at approximately 9 am , until his death at the ninth hour , corresponding to about 3 pm . the soldiers affixed a sign above his head stating " jesus of nazareth , king of the jews " in three languages , divided his garments and cast lots for his seamless robe . the roman soldiers did not break jesus ' legs , as they did to the other two men crucified ( breaking the legs hastened the crucifixion process ) , as jesus was dead already . each gospel has its own account of jesus ' last words , seven statements altogether . in the synoptic gospels , various supernatural events accompany the crucifixion , including darkness , an earthquake , and ( in matthew ) the resurrection of saints . following jesus ' death , his body was removed from the cross by joseph of arimathea and buried in a rock-hewn tomb , with nicodemus assisting .
on 23 february , the 28th marine regiment reached the summit of suribachi , prompting the now famous raising the flag on iwo jima picture . navy secretary james forrestal , upon seeing the flag , remarked " there will be a marine corps for the next 500 years . " the flag raising is often cited as the most reproduced photograph of all time and became the archetypal representation not only of that battle , but of the entire pacific war . for the rest of february , the americans pushed north , and by 1 march , had taken two-thirds of the island . but it was not until 26 march that the island was finally secured . the japanese fought to the last man , killing 6,800 marines and wounding nearly 20,000 more . the japanese losses totaled well over 20,000 men killed , and only 1,083 prisoners were taken . historians debate whether it was strategically worth the casualties sustained .

in 1892 captain davis of the hms royalist reported on trading activities and traders on each of the islands visited . captain davis identified the following traders in the ellice group : edmund duffy ( nanumea ) ; jack buckland ( niutao ) ; harry nitz ( vaitupu ) ; john ( also known as jack ) o 'brien ( funafuti ) ; alfred restieaux and emile fenisot ( nukufetau ) ; and martin kleis ( nui ) . during this time , the greatest number of palagi traders lived on the atolls , acting as agents for the trading companies . some islands would have competing traders while dryer islands might only have a single trader .
the economic structure of the empire was defined by its geopolitical structure . the ottoman empire stood between the west and the east , thus blocking the land route eastward and forcing spanish and portuguese navigators to set sail in search of a new route to the orient . the empire controlled the spice route that marco polo once used . when vasco da gama bypassed ottoman controlled routes and established direct trade links with india in 1498 , and christopher columbus first journeyed to the bahamas in 1492 , the ottoman empire was at its zenith .
the mc controls the conferencing while it is active on the signaling plane , which is simply where the system manages conferencing creation , endpoint signaling and in-conferencing controls . this component negotiates parameters with every endpoint in the network and controls conferencing resources . while the mc controls resources and signaling negotiations , the mp operates on the media plane and receives media from each endpoint . the mp generates output streams from each endpoint and redirects the information to other endpoints in the conference .
electric railways use electric locomotives to haul passengers or freight in separate cars or electric multiple units , passenger cars with their own motors . electricity is typically generated in large and relatively efficient generating stations , transmitted to the railway network and distributed to the trains . some electric railways have their own dedicated generating stations and transmission lines but most purchase power from an electric utility . the railway usually provides its own distribution lines , switches and transformers .
traditional eritrean attire is quite varied among the ethnic groups of eritrea . in the larger cities , most people dress in western casual dress such as jeans and shirts . in offices , both men and women often dress in suits . traditional clothing for christian tigrinya-speaking highlanders consists of bright white gowns called zurias for the women , and long white shirts accompanied by white pants for the men . in muslim communities in the eritrean lowland , the women traditionally dress in brightly colored clothes . only rashaida women maintain a tradition of covering half of their faces , though they do not cover their hair .
the semi-arid high plains in the state 's northwestern corner harbor few natural forests ; the region has a rolling to flat landscape with intermittent canyons and mesa ranges like the glass mountains . partial plains interrupted by small , sky island mountain ranges like the antelope hills and the wichita mountains dot southwestern oklahoma ; transitional prairie and oak savannahs cover the central portion of the state . the ozark and ouachita mountains rise from west to east over the state 's eastern third , gradually increasing in elevation in an eastward direction .
adaptation of the endosymbiont to the host 's lifestyle leads to many changes in the endosymbiont-the foremost being drastic reduction in its genome size . this is due to many genes being lost during the process of metabolism , and dna repair and recombination . while important genes participating in the dna to rna transcription , protein translation and dna / rna replication are retained . that is , a decrease in genome size is due to loss of protein coding genes and not due to lessening of inter-genic regions or open reading frame ( orf ) size . thus , species that are naturally evolving and contain reduced sizes of genes can be accounted for an increased number of noticeable differences between them , thereby leading to changes in their evolutionary rates . as the endosymbiotic bacteria related with these insects are passed on to the offspring strictly via vertical genetic transmission , intracellular bacteria goes through many hurdles during the process , resulting in the decrease in effective population sizes when compared to the free living bacteria . this incapability of the endosymbiotic bacteria to reinstate its wild type phenotype via a recombination process is called as muller 's ratchet phenomenon . muller 's ratchet phenomenon together with less effective population sizes has led to an accretion of deleterious mutations in the non-essential genes of the intracellular bacteria . this could have been due to lack of selection mechanisms prevailing in the rich environment of the host .
lee modeled the character of dill on her childhood friend , truman capote , known then as truman persons . just as dill lived next door to scout during the summer , capote lived next door to lee with his aunts while his mother visited new york city . like dill , capote had an impressive imagination and a gift for fascinating stories . both lee and capote were atypical children : both loved to read . lee was a scrappy tomboy who was quick to fight , but capote was ridiculed for his advanced vocabulary and lisp . she and capote made up and acted out stories they wrote on an old underwood typewriter lee 's father gave them . they became good friends when both felt alienated from their peers ; capote called the two of them " apart people . " in 1960 , capote and lee traveled to kansas together to investigate the multiple murders that were the basis for capote 's nonfiction novel in cold blood .
from the end of world war i until 1962 , new zealand controlled samoa as a class c mandate under trusteeship through the league of nations , then through the united nations . there followed a series of new zealand administrators who were responsible for two major incidents . in the first incident , approximately one fifth of the samoan population died in the influenza epidemic of 1918-1919 . between 1919 and 1962 , samoa was administered by the department of external affairs , a government department which had been specially created to oversee new zealand 's island territories and samoa . in 1943 , this department was renamed the department of island territories after a separate department of external affairs was created to conduct new zealand 's foreign affairs .
the president is the civilian commander in chief of the army and navy of the united states . he has the authority to command them to take appropriate military action in the event of a sudden crisis . however , only the congress is explicitly granted the power to declare war per se , as well as to raise , fund and maintain the armed forces . congress also has the duty and authority to prescribe the laws and regulations under which the armed forces operate , such as the uniform code of military justice , and requires that all generals and admirals appointed by the president be confirmed by a majority vote of the senate before they can assume their office .
epigenetics is the study of mitotically and / or meiotically heritable changes in gene function that cannot be explained by changes in the underlying dna sequence but cause the organism 's genes to behave ( or " express themselves " ) differently . one example of epigenetic change is the marking of the genes by dna methylation which determines whether they will be expressed or not . gene expression can also be controlled by repressor proteins that attach to silencer regions of the dna and prevent that region of the dna code from being expressed . epigenetic marks may be added or removed from the dna during programmed stages of development of the plant , and are responsible , for example , for the differences between anthers , petals and normal leaves , despite the fact that they all have the same underlying genetic code . epigenetic changes may be temporary or may remain through successive cell divisions for the remainder of the cell 's life . some epigenetic changes have been shown to be heritable , while others are reset in the germ cells .
the economist f. a. hayek analyzed how the rule of law might be beneficial to the free market . hayek proposed that under the rule of law individuals would be able to make wise investments and future plans with some confidence in a successful return on investment when he stated : " under the rule of law the government is prevented from stultifying individual efforts by ad hoc action . within the known rules of the game the individual is free to pursue his personal ends and desires , certain that the powers of government will not be used deliberately to frustrate his efforts .

some critics express the opinion that it is only from the mid-19th century , and especially in the 20th century , that the score began to hold such a high significance . previously , improvisation ( in preludes , cadenzas and ornaments ) , rhythmic flexibility ( e.g. , tempo rubato ) , improvisatory deviation from the score and oral tradition of playing was integral to the style . yet in the 20th century , this oral tradition and passing on of stylistic features within classical music disappeared . instead , musicians tend to use just the score to play music . yet , even with the score providing the key elements of the music , there is considerable controversy about how to perform the works . some of this controversy relates to the fact that this score-centric approach has led to performances that emphasize metrically strict block-rhythms ( just as the music is notated in the score ) .
the u.s. census race definitions says a " black " is a person having origins in any of the black ( sub-saharan ) racial groups of africa . it includes people who indicate their race as " black , african am . , or negro " or who provide written entries such as african american , afro-american , kenyan , nigerian , or haitian . the census bureau notes that these classifications are socio-political constructs and should not be interpreted as scientific or anthropological . most african americans also have european ancestry in varying amounts ; a lesser proportion have some native american ancestry . for instance , genetic studies of african americans show an ancestry that is on average 17-18 % european .
the end of the war , however , was to cause profound change in bermuda , though some of those changes would take decades to crystallise . following the war , with the buildup of naval and military forces in bermuda , the primary leg of the bermudian economy became defence infrastructure . even after tourism began later in the 19th century , bermuda remained , in the eyes of london , a base more than a colony . the crown strengthened its political and economic ties to bermuda , and the colony 's independence on the world stage was diminished .

rainfall tends to be associated with atlantic depressions or with convection . the atlantic depressions are more vigorous in autumn and winter and most of the rain which falls in those seasons in the south-west is from this source . average annual rainfall is around 980 millimetres ( 39 in ) . november to march have the highest mean wind speeds , with june to august having the lightest winds . the predominant wind direction is from the south-west .
in a career spanning more than four decades , spielberg 's films have covered many themes and genres . spielberg 's early science-fiction and adventure films were seen as archetypes of modern hollywood blockbuster filmmaking . in later years , his films began addressing humanistic issues such as the holocaust ( in schindler 's list ) , the transatlantic slave trade ( in amistad ) , war ( in empire of the sun , saving private ryan , war horse and bridge of spies ) and terrorism ( in munich ) . his other films include close encounters of the third kind , the indiana jones film series , and a.i. artificial intelligence .
in 1516 , william iv , duke of bavaria , adopted the reinheitsgebot ( purity law ) , perhaps the oldest food-quality regulation still in use in the 21st century , according to which the only allowed ingredients of beer are water , hops and barley-malt . beer produced before the industrial revolution continued to be made and sold on a domestic scale , although by the 7th century ad , beer was also being produced and sold by european monasteries . during the industrial revolution , the production of beer moved from artisanal manufacture to industrial manufacture , and domestic manufacture ceased to be significant by the end of the 19th century . the development of hydrometers and thermometers changed brewing by allowing the brewer more control of the process and greater knowledge of the results .
because the electron mobility is higher than the hole mobility for all semiconductor materials , a given bipolar n-p-n transistor tends to be swifter than an equivalent p-n-p transistor . gaas has the highest electron mobility of the three semiconductors . it is for this reason that gaas is used in high-frequency applications . a relatively recent fet development , the high-electron-mobility transistor ( hemt ) , has a heterostructure ( junction between different semiconductor materials ) of aluminium gallium arsenide ( algaas ) -gallium arsenide ( gaas ) which has twice the electron mobility of a gaas-metal barrier junction . because of their high speed and low noise , hemts are used in satellite receivers working at frequencies around 12 ghz . hemts based on gallium nitride and aluminium gallium nitride ( algan / gan hemts ) provide a still higher electron mobility and are being developed for various applications .
on february 7 , 1987 , dozens of political prisoners were freed in the first group release since khrushchev 's " thaw " in the mid-1950s . on may 6 , 1987 , pamyat , a russian nationalist group , held an unsanctioned demonstration in moscow . the authorities did not break up the demonstration and even kept traffic out of the demonstrators ' way while they marched to an impromptu meeting with boris yeltsin , head of the moscow communist party and at the time one of gorbachev 's closest allies . on july 25 , 1987 , 300 crimean tatars staged a noisy demonstration near the kremlin wall for several hours , calling for the right to return to their homeland , from which they were deported in 1944 ; police and soldiers merely looked on .
the interior of galicia is characterized by its hilly landscape , although mountain ranges rise to 2,000 m ( 6,600 ft ) in the east and south . the coastal areas are mostly an alternate series of rias ( submerged valleys where the sea penetrates tens of kilometres inland ) and cliffs . the climate of galicia is temperate and rainy , but it is also markedly drier in the summer , being usually classified as oceanic in the west and north , and mediterranean in the southeast . its topographic and climatic conditions have made animal husbandry and farming the primary source of galicia 's wealth for most of its history . with the exception of shipbuilding and food processing , galicia was largely a semi-subsistence farming and fishing economy and did not experience significant industrialization until after the mid-20th century . in 2012 , the gross domestic product at purchasing power parity was € 56,000 million , with a nominal gdp per capita of € 20,700 . the population is largely concentrated in two coastal areas : from ferrol to a coruna in the northwest and from pontevedra to vigo in the southwest . to a lesser extent , there are smaller populations around the interior cities of lugo , ourense and santiago de compostela . the political capital is santiago de compostela , in the province of a coruna . vigo , in the province of pontevedra , is the most populous municipality with 294,997 ( 2014 ) , while a coruna is the most populous city with 215.227 ( 2014 ) .
examples of ottoman architecture of the classical period , besides istanbul and edirne , can also be seen in egypt , eritrea , tunisia , algiers , the balkans and romania , where mosques , bridges , fountains and schools were built . the art of ottoman decoration developed with a multitude of influences due to the wide ethnic range of the ottoman empire . the greatest of the court artists enriched the ottoman empire with many pluralistic artistic influences : such as mixing traditional byzantine art with elements of chinese art .
the east india company 's arms , granted in 1698 , were : " argent a cross gules ; in the dexter chief quarter an escutcheon of the arms of france and england quarterly , the shield ornamentally and regally crowned or . " the crest was : " a lion rampant guardant or holding between the forepaws a regal crown proper . " the supporters were : " two lions rampant guardant or , each supporting a banner erect argent , charged with a cross gules . " the motto was auspicio regis et senatus angliæ ( latin : by right of the king and the senate of england ) .
in sweden , the supreme court and the supreme administrative court respectively function as the highest courts of the land . the supreme administrative court considers cases concerning disputes between individuals and administrative organs , as well as disputes among administrative organs , while the supreme court considers all other cases . the judges are appointed by the government . in most cases , the supreme courts will only grant leave to appeal a case ( provningstillstand ) if the case involves setting a precedent in the interpretation of the law . exceptions are issues where the supreme court is the court of first instance . such cases include an application for a retrial of a criminal case in the light of new evidence , and prosecutions made against an incumbent minister of the government for severe neglect of duty . if a lower court has to try a case which involves a question where there is no settled interpretation of the law , it can also refer the question to the relevant supreme court for an answer .
according to the latest international monetary fund estimates , its per capita gdp ( adjusted for purchasing power ) at $ 30,769 is just above the average of the european union . [ citation needed ] cyprus has been sought as a base for several offshore businesses for its low tax rates . tourism , financial services and shipping are significant parts of the economy . economic policy of the cyprus government has focused on meeting the criteria for admission to the european union . the cypriot government adopted the euro as the national currency on 1 january 2008 .
whitehead pointed to the limitations of language as one of the main culprits in maintaining a materialistic way of thinking , and acknowledged that it may be difficult to ever wholly move past such ideas in everyday speech . after all , each moment of each person 's life can hardly be given a different proper name , and it is easy and convenient to think of people and objects as remaining fundamentally the same things , rather than constantly keeping in mind that each thing is a different thing from what it was a moment ago . yet the limitations of everyday living and everyday speech should not prevent people from realizing that " material substances " or " essences " are a convenient generalized description of a continuum of particular , concrete processes . no one questions that a ten-year-old person is quite different by the time he or she turns thirty years old , and in many ways is not the same person at all ; whitehead points out that it is not philosophically or ontologically sound to think that a person is the same from one second to the next .
relics of qutb shahi and nizam rule remain visible today , with the charminar - commissioned by muhammad quli qutb shah - coming to symbolise hyderabad . golconda fort is another major landmark . the influence of mughlai culture is also evident in the city 's distinctive cuisine , which includes hyderabadi biryani and hyderabadi haleem . the qutb shahis and nizams established hyderabad as a cultural hub , attracting men of letters from different parts of the world . hyderabad emerged as the foremost centre of culture in india with the decline of the mughal empire in the mid-19th century , with artists migrating to the city from the rest of the indian subcontinent . while hyderabad is losing its cultural pre-eminence , it is today , due to the telugu film industry , the country 's second-largest producer of motion pictures .
like maradona , ronaldo only stayed a short time before he left for internazionale . however , new heroes emerged , such as luis figo , patrick kluivert , luis enrique and rivaldo , and the team won a copa del rey and la liga double in 1998 . in 1999 , the club celebrated its centenari , winning the primera division title , and rivaldo became the fourth barcelona player to be awarded european footballer of the year . despite this domestic success , the failure to emulate real madrid in the champions league led to van gaal and nunez resigning in 2000 .
in 1853 the russian empire on behalf of the slavic balkan states began to question the very existence of the ottoman empire . the result was the crimean war , 1853-1856 , in which the british empire and the french empire supported the ottoman empire in its struggle against the incursions of the russian empire . eventually , the ottoman empire lost control of the balkan region .
in the last two decades of the 18th century , the theory of polygenism , the belief that different races had evolved separately in each continent and shared no common ancestor , was advocated in england by historian edward long and anatomist charles white , in germany by ethnographers christoph meiners and georg forster , and in france by julien-joseph virey . in the us , samuel george morton , josiah nott and louis agassiz promoted this theory in the mid-nineteenth century . polygenism was popular and most widespread in the 19th century , culminating in the founding of the anthropological society of london ( 1863 ) during the period of the american civil war , in opposition to the ethnological society , which had abolitionist sympathies .
the development of writing enabled knowledge to be stored and communicated across generations with much greater fidelity . combined with the development of agriculture , which allowed for a surplus of food , it became possible for early civilizations to develop , because more time and effort could be devoted to tasks ( other than food production ) than hunter-gatherers or early subsistence farmers had available . this surplus allowed a community to support individuals who did things other than work towards bare survival . these other tasks included systematic studies of nature , study of written information gathered and recorded by others , and often of adding to that body of information .
however , as stealth technology grows , so does anti-stealth technology . multiple transmitter radars such as those from bistatic radars and low-frequency radars are said to have the capabilities to detect stealth aircraft . advanced forms of thermographic cameras such as those that incorporate qwips would be able to optically see a stealth aircraft regardless of the aircraft 's rcs . in addition , side looking radars , high-powered optical satellites , and sky-scanning , high-aperture , high sensitivity radars such as radio telescopes , would all be able to narrow down the location of a stealth aircraft under certain parameters . the newest sam 's have a claimed ability to be able to detect and engage stealth targets , with the most notable being the s-400 , which is claimed to be able to detect a target with a 0.05 meter squared rcs from 90 km away .
after the allied setbacks in 1943 , the south east asia command prepared to launch offensives into burma on several fronts . in the first months of 1944 , the chinese and american troops of the northern combat area command ( ncac ) , commanded by the american joseph stilwell , began extending the ledo road from india into northern burma , while the xv corps began an advance along the coast in the arakan province . in february 1944 the japanese mounted a local counter-attack in the arakan . after early japanese success , this counter-attack was defeated when the indian divisions of xv corps stood firm , relying on aircraft to drop supplies to isolated forward units until reserve divisions could relieve them .
switzerland 's ecosystems can be particularly fragile , because the many delicate valleys separated by high mountains often form unique ecologies . the mountainous regions themselves are also vulnerable , with a rich range of plants not found at other altitudes , and experience some pressure from visitors and grazing . the climatic , geological and topographical conditions of the alpine region make for a very fragile ecosystem that is particularly sensitive to climate change . nevertheless , according to the 2014 environmental performance index , switzerland ranks first among 132 nations in safeguarding the environment , due to its high scores on environmental public health , its heavy reliance on renewable sources of energy ( hydropower and geothermal energy ) , and its control of greenhouse gas emissions .
during john 's early years , henry attempted to resolve the question of his succession . henry the young king had been crowned king of england in 1170 , but was not given any formal powers by his father ; he was also promised normandy and anjou as part of his future inheritance . richard was to be appointed the count of poitou with control of aquitaine , whilst geoffrey was to become the duke of brittany . at this time it seemed unlikely that john would ever inherit substantial lands , and he was jokingly nicknamed " lackland " by his father .
hunting big game typically requires a " tag " for each animal harvested . tags must be purchased in addition to the hunting license , and the number of tags issued to an individual is typically limited . in cases where there are more prospective hunters than the quota for that species , tags are usually assigned by lottery . tags may be further restricted to a specific area , or wildlife management unit . hunting migratory waterfowl requires a duck stamp from the fish and wildlife service in addition to the appropriate state hunting license .
the legend of virgil in his basket arose in the middle ages , and is often seen in art and mentioned in literature as part of the power of women literary topos , demonstrating the disruptive force of female attractiveness on men . in this story virgil became enamoured of a beautiful woman , sometimes described as the emperor 's daughter or mistress and called lucretia . she played him along and agreed to an assignation at her house , which he was to sneak into at night by climbing into a large basket let down from a window . when he did so he was only hoisted halfway up the wall and then left him trapped there into the next day , exposed to public ridicule . the story paralleled that of phyllis riding aristotle . among other artists depicting the scene , lucas van leyden made a woodcut and later an engraving .
society throughout europe was disturbed by the dislocations caused by the black death . lands that had been marginally productive were abandoned , as the survivors were able to acquire more fertile areas . although serfdom declined in western europe it became more common in eastern europe , as landlords imposed it on those of their tenants who had previously been free . most peasants in western europe managed to change the work they had previously owed to their landlords into cash rents . the percentage of serfs amongst the peasantry declined from a high of 90 to closer to 50 per cent by the end of the period . landlords also became more conscious of common interests with other landholders , and they joined together to extort privileges from their governments . partly at the urging of landlords , governments attempted to legislate a return to the economic conditions that existed before the black death . non-clergy became increasingly literate , and urban populations began to imitate the nobility 's interest in chivalry .
the british royal navy is constructing two new larger stovl aircraft carriers , the queen elizabeth class , to replace the three invincible-class carriers . the ships will be named hms queen elizabeth and hms prince of wales . they will be able to operate up to 40 aircraft in peace time with a tailored group of up to 50 , and will have a displacement of 70,600 tonnes . the ships are due to become operational from 2020 . their primary aircraft complement will be made up of f-35b lightning iis , and their ship 's company will number around 680 with the total complement rising to about 1,600 when the air group is embarked . defensive weapons will include the phalanx close-in weapons system for anti-aircraft and anti-missile defence ; also 30 mm automated small calibre guns and miniguns for use against fast attack craft . the two ships will be the largest warships ever built for the royal navy .
the antiquity of this form of writing extends before the invention of paper around the year 100 in china . note each palm leaf section was only several lines , written longitudinally across the leaf , and bound by twine to the other sections . the outer portion was decorated . the alphabets of southeast asia tended to be abugidas , until the arrival of the europeans , who used words that also ended in consonants , not just vowels . other forms of official documents , which did not use paper , included javanese copperplate scrolls . this material would have been more durable than paper in the tropical climate of southeast asia .
the national archives building , known informally as archives i , located north of the national mall on constitution avenue in washington , d.c. , opened as its original headquarters in 1935 . it holds the original copies of the three main formative documents of the united states and its government : the declaration of independence , the constitution , and the bill of rights . it also hosts a copy of the 1297 magna carta confirmed by edward i. these are displayed to the public in the main chamber of the national archives , which is called the rotunda for the charters of freedom . the national archives building also exhibits other important american historical documents such as the louisiana purchase treaty , the emancipation proclamation , and collections of photography and other historically and culturally significant american artifacts .

very small lamps may have the filament support wires extended through the base of the lamp , and can be directly soldered to a printed circuit board for connections . some reflector-type lamps include screw terminals for connection of wires . most lamps have metal bases that fit in a socket to support the lamp and conduct current to the filament wires . in the late 19th century , manufacturers introduced a multitude of incompatible lamp bases . general electric introduced standard base sizes for tungsten incandescent lamps under the mazda trademark in 1909 . this standard was soon adopted across the us , and the mazda name was used by many manufacturers under license through 1945 . today most incandescent lamps for general lighting service use an edison screw in candelabra , intermediate , or standard or mogul sizes , or double contact bayonet base . technical standards for lamp bases include ansi standard c81.67 and iec standard 60061-1 for common commercial lamp sizes , to ensure interchangeablitity between different manufacturer 's products . bayonet base lamps are frequently used in automotive lamps to resist loosening due to vibration . a bipin base is often used for halogen or reflector lamps .
in the late 19th and early 20th century several forms of pragmatic philosophy arose . the ideas of pragmatism , in its various forms , developed mainly from discussions between charles sanders peirce and william james when both men were at harvard in the 1870s . james popularized the term " pragmatism , " giving peirce full credit for its patrimony , but peirce later demurred from the tangents that the movement was taking , and redubbed what he regarded as the original idea with the name of " pragmaticism . " along with its pragmatic theory of truth , this perspective integrates the basic insights of empirical ( experience-based ) and rational ( concept-based ) thinking .
the decorations were seldom displayed , however . after the tito-stalin split of 1948 and his inauguration as president in 1953 , tito rarely wore his uniform except when present in a military function , and then ( with rare exception ) only wore his yugoslav ribbons for obvious practical reasons . the awards were displayed in full number only at his funeral in 1980 . tito 's reputation as one of the allied leaders of world war ii , along with his diplomatic position as the founder of the non-aligned movement , was primarily the cause of the favorable international recognition .

the ethnogenesis of the greek nation is linked to the development of pan-hellenism in the 8th century bc . according to some scholars , the foundational event was the olympic games in 776 bc , when the idea of a common hellenism among the greek tribes was first translated into a shared cultural experience and hellenism was primarily a matter of common culture . the works of homer ( i.e. iliad and odyssey ) and hesiod ( i.e. theogony ) were written in the 8th century bc , becoming the basis of the national religion , ethos , history and mythology . the oracle of apollo at delphi was established in this period .

the observation that old windows are sometimes found to be thicker at the bottom than at the top is often offered as supporting evidence for the view that glass flows over a timescale of centuries , the assumption being that the glass has exhibited the liquid property of flowing from one shape to another . this assumption is incorrect , as once solidified , glass stops flowing . the reason for the observation is that in the past , when panes of glass were commonly made by glassblowers , the technique used was to spin molten glass so as to create a round , mostly flat and even plate ( the crown glass process , described above ) . this plate was then cut to fit a window . the pieces were not absolutely flat ; the edges of the disk became a different thickness as the glass spun . when installed in a window frame , the glass would be placed with the thicker side down both for the sake of stability and to prevent water accumulating in the lead cames at the bottom of the window . occasionally such glass has been found installed with the thicker side at the top , left or right .
the existence of literary and colloquial readings ( 文白異讀 ) , called tha  k-im ( 讀音 ) , is a prominent feature of some hokkien dialects and indeed in many sinitic varieties in the south . the bulk of literary readings ( 文讀 , bun-tha  k ) , based on pronunciations of the vernacular during the tang dynasty , are mainly used in formal phrases and written language ( e.g. philosophical concepts , surnames , and some place names ) , while the colloquial ( or vernacular ) ones ( 白讀 , pe  h-tha  k ) are basically used in spoken language and vulgar phrases . literary readings are more similar to the pronunciations of the tang standard of middle chinese than their colloquial equivalents .
the leading cubist architects were pavel janak , josef gocar , vlastislav hofman , emil kralicek and josef chochol . they worked mostly in prague but also in other bohemian towns . the best-known cubist building is the house of the black madonna in the old town of prague built in 1912 by josef gocar with the only cubist cafe in the world , grand cafe orient . vlastislav hofman built the entrance pavilions of dablice cemetery in 1912-1914 , josef chochol designed several residential houses under vysehrad . a cubist streetlamp has also been preserved near the wenceslas square , designed by emil kralicek in 1912 , who also built the diamond house in the new town of prague around 1913 .

the greek kingdom of bactria began as a breakaway satrapy of the seleucid empire , which , because of the size of the empire , had significant freedom from central control . between 255-246 bce , the governor of bactria , sogdiana and margiana ( most of present-day afghanistan ) , one diodotus , took this process to its logical extreme and declared himself king . diodotus ii , son of diodotus , was overthrown in about 230 bc by euthydemus , possibly the satrap of sogdiana , who then started his own dynasty . in c . 210 bc , the greco-bactrian kingdom was invaded by a resurgent seleucid empire under antiochus iii . while victorious in the field , it seems antiochus came to realise that there were advantages in the status quo ( perhaps sensing that bactria could not be governed from syria ) , and married one of his daughters to euthydemus 's son , thus legitimising the greco-bactria dynasty . soon afterwards the greco-bactrian kingdom seems to have expanded , possibly taking advantage of the defeat of the parthian king arsaces ii by antiochus .

the idea of masonic brotherhood probably descends from a 16th-century legal definition of a brother as one who has taken an oath of mutual support to another . accordingly , masons swear at each degree to keep the contents of that degree secret , and to support and protect their brethren unless they have broken the law . in most lodges the oath or obligation is taken on a volume of sacred law , whichever book of divine revelation is appropriate to the religious beliefs of the individual brother ( usually the bible in the anglo-american tradition ) . in progressive continental freemasonry , books other than scripture are permissible , a cause of rupture between grand lodges .

the xiongnu , a nomadic steppe confederation , defeated the han in 200 bc and forced the han to submit as a de facto inferior partner , but continued their raids on the han borders . emperor wu of han ( r . 141-87 bc ) launched several military campaigns against them . the ultimate han victory in these wars eventually forced the xiongnu to accept vassal status as han tributaries . these campaigns expanded han sovereignty into the tarim basin of central asia , divided the xiongnu into two separate confederations , and helped establish the vast trade network known as the silk road , which reached as far as the mediterranean world . the territories north of han 's borders were quickly overrun by the nomadic xianbei confederation . emperor wu also launched successful military expeditions in the south , annexing nanyue in 111 bc and dian in 109 bc , and in the korean peninsula where the xuantu and lelang commanderies were established in 108 bc .

genocide has become an official term used in international relations . the word genocide was not in use before 1944 . before this , in 1941 , winston churchill described the mass killing of russian prisoners of war and civilians as " a crime without a name . " in that year , a polish-jewish lawyer named raphael lemkin , described the policies of systematic murder founded by the nazis as genocide . the word genocide is the combination of the greek prefix geno- ( meaning tribe or race ) and caedere ( the latin word for to kill ) . the word is defined as a specific set of violent crimes that are committed against a certain group with the attempt to remove the entire group from existence or to destroy them .
the various germanic states in the west all had coinages that imitated existing roman and byzantine forms . gold continued to be minted until the end of the 7th century , when it was replaced by silver coins . the basic frankish silver coin was the denarius or denier , while the anglo-saxon version was called a penny . from these areas , the denier or penny spread throughout europe during the centuries from 700 to 1000 . copper or bronze coins were not struck , nor were gold except in southern europe . no silver coins denominated in multiple units were minted .
the high middle ages was the formative period in the history of the modern western state . kings in france , england , and spain consolidated their power , and set up lasting governing institutions . new kingdoms such as hungary and poland , after their conversion to christianity , became central european powers . the magyars settled hungary around 900 under king arpad ( d. c . 907 ) after a series of invasions in the 9th century . the papacy , long attached to an ideology of independence from secular kings , first asserted its claim to temporal authority over the entire christian world ; the papal monarchy reached its apogee in the early 13th century under the pontificate of innocent iii ( pope 1198-1216 ) . northern crusades and the advance of christian kingdoms and military orders into previously pagan regions in the baltic and finnic north-east brought the forced assimilation of numerous native peoples into european culture .

west 's fifth album , my beautiful dark twisted fantasy , has been noted by writers for its maximalist aesthetic and its incorporation of elements from west 's previous four albums . entertainment weekly 's simon vozick-levinson perceives that such elements " all recur at various points , " namely " the luxurious soul of 2004 's the college dropout , the symphonic pomp of late registration , the gloss of 2007 's graduation , and the emotionally exhausted electro of 2008 's 808s & heartbreak . " sean fennessey of the village voice writes that west " absorb [ ed ] the gifts of his handpicked collaborators , and occasionally elevat [ ed ] them " on previous studio albums , noting collaborators and elements as jon brion for late registration , dj toomp for graduation , and kid cudi for 808s & heartbreak .
to differentiate nintendo 's new home platform from the early 1980s ' common perception of a troubled and shallow video game market , the company freshened its product nomenclature and positioning , and it established a strict product approval and licensing policy . the overall system was referred to as an " entertainment system " instead of a " video game system , " which was centered upon a machine called a " control deck " instead of a " console , " and which featured software cartridges called " game paks " instead of " video games . " the 10nes lockout chip system acted as a lock-and-key coupling of each game pak and control deck , deterring the copying or production of nes games which had not first achieved nintendo 's licensed approval . the packaging of the launch lineup of nes games bore pictures of a very close representation of the actual onscreen graphics of the game , which were of sufficiently recognizable quality on their own . symbols on the launch games ' packaging clearly indicated the genre of the game , in order to reduce consumer confusion . a ' seal of quality ' was printed on all appropriately licensed game and accessory packaging . the initial seal stated , " this seal is your assurance that nintendo has approved and guaranteed the quality of this product . " this text was later changed to " official nintendo seal of quality . "

palermo experiences a hot-summer mediterranean climate ( koppen climate classification : csa ) . winters are cool and wet , while summers are hot and dry . temperatures in autumn and spring are usually mild . palermo is one of the warmest cities in europe ( mainly due to its warm nights ) , with an average annual air temperature of 18.5 ° c ( 65.3 ° f ) . it receives approximately 2,530 hours of sunshine per year . snow is usually a rare occurrence , but it does occur occasionally if there is a cold front , as the apennines are too distant to protect the island from cold winds blowing from the balkans , and the mountains surrounding the city facilite the formation of snow accumulation in palermo , especially at night . between the 1940s and the 2000s there have been eleven times when considerable snowfall has occurred : in 1949 , in 1956 , when the minimum temperature went down to 0 ° c ( 32 ° f ) and the city was blanketed by several centimeters of snow . snow also occurred in 1999 , 2009 and 2015 . the average annual temperature of the sea is above 19 ° c ( 66 ° f ) ; from 14 ° c ( 57 ° f ) in february to 26 ° c ( 79 ° f ) in august . in the period from may to november , the average sea temperature exceeds 18 ° c ( 64 ° f ) and in the period from june to october , the average sea temperature exceeds 21 ° c ( 70 ° f ) .
the rediscovery of aristotle 's works-more than 3000 pages of it would eventually be translated -fuelled a spirit of inquiry into natural processes that had already begun to emerge in the 12th century . some scholars believe that these works represented one of the most important document discoveries in western intellectual history . richard dales , for instance , calls the discovery of aristotle 's works " a turning point in the history of western thought . " after aristotle re-emerged , a community of scholars , primarily communicating in latin , accelerated the process and practice of attempting to reconcile the thoughts of greek antiquity , and especially ideas related to understanding the natural world , with those of the church . the efforts of this " scholasticism " were focused on applying aristotelian logic and thoughts about natural processes to biblical passages and attempting to prove the viability of those passages through reason . this became the primary mission of lecturers , and the expectation of students .
dominic became the spiritual father to several albigensian women he had reconciled to the faith , and in 1206 he established them in a convent in prouille . this convent would become the foundation of the dominican nuns , thus making the dominican nuns older than the dominican friars . prior diego sanctioned the building of a monastery for girls whose parents had sent them to the care of the albigensians because their families were too poor to fulfill their basic needs . the monastery was at prouille would later become dominic 's headquarters for his missionary effort there . after two years on the mission field , prior diego died while traveling back to spain . when his preaching companions heard of his death , all save dominic and a very small number of others returned to their homes .

submission was initially a large factor in professional wrestling , but following the decline of the submission-oriented catch-as-catch-can style from mainstream professional wrestling , the submission largely faded until the rise of the legitimate sport of mixed martial arts . despite this , some wrestlers , such as chris jericho , the undertaker , ric flair , bret hart , kurt angle , ken shamrock , dean malenko , chris benoit , and tazz , became famous for winning matches via submission . a wrestler with a signature submission technique is portrayed as better at applying the hold , making it more painful or more difficult to get out of than others who use it , or can be falsely credited as inventing the hold ( such as when tazz popularized the kata ha jime judo choke in pro wrestling as the " tazzmission " ) .

in 1827 , hungarian physicist anyos jedlik started experimenting with electromagnetic coils . after jedlik solved the technical problems of the continuous rotation with the invention of the commutator , he called his early devices " electromagnetic self-rotors . " although they were used only for instructional purposes , in 1828 jedlik demonstrated the first device to contain the three main components of practical dc motors : the stator , rotor and commutator . the device employed no permanent magnets , as the magnetic fields of both the stationary and revolving components were produced solely by the currents flowing through their windings .
the great irish famine brought a large influx of irish immigrants . over 200,000 were living in new york by 1860 , upwards of a quarter of the city 's population . there was also extensive immigration from the german provinces , where revolutions had disrupted societies , and germans comprised another 25 % of new york 's population by 1860 .

meanwhile , begin 's government provided incentives for israelis to settle in the occupied west bank , increasing friction with the palestinians in that area . the basic law : jerusalem , the capital of israel , passed in 1980 , was believed by some to reaffirm israel 's 1967 annexation of jerusalem by government decree , and reignited international controversy over the status of the city . no israeli legislation has defined the territory of israel and no act specifically included east jerusalem therein . the position of the majority of un member states is reflected in numerous resolutions declaring that actions taken by israel to settle its citizens in the west bank , and impose its laws and administration on east jerusalem , are illegal and have no validity . in 1981 israel annexed the golan heights , although annexation was not recognized internationally .

the earliest writers on sexual orientation usually understood it to be intrinsically linked to the subject 's own sex . for example , it was thought that a typical female-bodied person who is attracted to female-bodied persons would have masculine attributes , and vice versa . this understanding was shared by most of the significant theorists of sexual orientation from the mid nineteenth to early twentieth century , such as karl heinrich ulrichs , richard von krafft-ebing , magnus hirschfeld , havelock ellis , carl jung , and sigmund freud , as well as many gender-variant homosexual people themselves . however , this understanding of homosexuality as sexual inversion was disputed at the time , and , through the second half of the twentieth century , gender identity came to be increasingly seen as a phenomenon distinct from sexual orientation . transgender and cisgender people may be attracted to men , women , or both , although the prevalence of different sexual orientations is quite different in these two populations . an individual homosexual , heterosexual or bisexual person may be masculine , feminine , or androgynous , and in addition , many members and supporters of lesbian and gay communities now see the " gender-conforming heterosexual " and the " gender-nonconforming homosexual " as negative stereotypes . nevertheless , studies by j. michael bailey and kenneth zucker found a majority of the gay men and lesbians sampled reporting various degrees of gender-nonconformity during their childhood years .

many hunter-gatherers consciously manipulate the landscape through cutting or burning undesirable plants while encouraging desirable ones , some even going to the extent of slash-and-burn to create habitat for game animals . these activities are on an entirely different scale to those associated with agriculture , but they are nevertheless domestication on some level . today , almost all hunter-gatherers depend to some extent upon domesticated food sources either produced part-time or traded for products acquired in the wild .
the modern pharmaceutical industry traces its roots to two sources . the first of these were local apothecaries that expanded from their traditional role distributing botanical drugs such as morphine and quinine to wholesale manufacture in the mid 1800s . rational drug discovery from plants started particularly with the isolation of morphine , analgesic and sleep-inducing agent from opium , by the german apothecary assistant friedrich serturner , who named the compound after the greek god of dreams , morpheus . multinational corporations including merck , hoffman-la roche , burroughs-wellcome ( now part of glaxo smith kline ) , abbott laboratories , eli lilly and upjohn ( now part of pfizer ) began as local apothecary shops in the mid-1800s . by the late 1880s , german dye manufacturers had perfected the purification of individual organic compounds from coal tar and other mineral sources and had also established rudimentary methods in organic chemical synthesis . the development of synthetic chemical methods allowed scientists to systematically vary the structure of chemical substances , and growth in the emerging science of pharmacology expanded their ability to evaluate the biological effects of these structural changes .
sociological attention to emotion has varied over time . emile durkheim ( 1915 / 1965 ) wrote about the collective effervescence or emotional energy that was experienced by members of totemic rituals in australian aborigine society . he explained how the heightened state of emotional energy achieved during totemic rituals transported individuals above themselves giving them the sense that they were in the presence of a higher power , a force , that was embedded in the sacred objects that were worshipped . these feelings of exaltation , he argued , ultimately lead people to believe that there were forces that governed sacred objects .

in 1968 , reprise planned to release a series of 78 rpm singles from their artists on their label at the time , called the reprise speed series . only one disc actually saw release , randy newman 's i think it 's going to rain today , a track from his self-titled debut album ( with the beehive state on the flipside ) . reprise did not proceed further with the series due to a lack of sales for the single , and a lack of general interest in the concept . guitarist & vocalist leon redbone released a promotional 78 rpm record in 1978 featuring two songs ( alabama jubilee and please don 't talk about me when i 'm gone ) from his champagne charlie album . in 1980 stiff records in the united kingdom issued a 78 by joe " king " carrasco containing the songs buena ( spanish for " good , " with the alternate spelling " bueno " on the label ) and tuff enuff . underground comic cartoonist and 78 rpm record collector robert crumb released three discs with his cheap suit serenaders in the 1980s .
when the war had begun , european public opinion heavily favored the germans ; many italians attempted to sign up as volunteers at the prussian embassy in florence and a prussian diplomat visited giuseppe garibaldi in caprera . bismarck 's demand for the return of alsace caused a dramatic shift in that sentiment in italy , which was best exemplified by the reaction of garibaldi soon after the revolution in paris , who told the movimento of genoa on 7 september 1870 that " yesterday i said to you : war to the death to bonaparte . today i say to you : rescue the french republic by every means . " garibaldi went to france and assumed command of the army of the vosges , with which he operated around dijon till the end of the war .
parasites can at times be difficult to distinguish from grazers . their feeding behavior is similar in many ways , however they are noted for their close association with their host species . while a grazing species such as an elephant may travel many kilometers in a single day , grazing on many plants in the process , parasites form very close associations with their hosts , usually having only one or at most a few in their lifetime . this close living arrangement may be described by the term symbiosis , " living together , " but unlike mutualism the association significantly reduces the fitness of the host . parasitic organisms range from the macroscopic mistletoe , a parasitic plant , to microscopic internal parasites such as cholera . some species however have more loose associations with their hosts . lepidoptera ( butterfly and moth ) larvae may feed parasitically on only a single plant , or they may graze on several nearby plants . it is therefore wise to treat this classification system as a continuum rather than four isolated forms .
immediately after the earthquake event , mobile and terrestrial telecommunications were cut to the affected and surrounding area , with all internet capabilities cut to the sichuan area too . elements of telecommunications were restored by the government piece by piece over the next number of months as the situation in the sichuan province gradually improved . eventually , a handful of major news and media websites were made accessible online in the region , albeit with dramatically pared back webpages .
by 1860 , houston had emerged as a commercial and railroad hub for the export of cotton . railroad spurs from the texas inland converged in houston , where they met rail lines to the ports of galveston and beaumont . during the american civil war , houston served as a headquarters for general john bankhead magruder , who used the city as an organization point for the battle of galveston . after the civil war , houston businessmen initiated efforts to widen the city 's extensive system of bayous so the city could accept more commerce between downtown and the nearby port of galveston . by 1890 , houston was the railroad center of texas .
the game is included in the newspaper on mondays , and details all the weekend 's football activity ( premier league and football league championship , league one and league two . ) the scottish edition of the game also includes results and analysis from scottish premier league games .
an important civic sculpture in detroit is " the spirit of detroit " by marshall fredericks at the coleman young municipal center . the image is often used as a symbol of detroit and the statue itself is occasionally dressed in sports jerseys to celebrate when a detroit team is doing well . a memorial to joe louis at the intersection of jefferson and woodward avenues was dedicated on october 16 , 1986 . the sculpture , commissioned by sports illustrated and executed by robert graham , is a 24-foot ( 7.3 m ) long arm with a fisted hand suspended by a pyramidal framework .
following the catastrophic events in asia minor , the monarchy was abolished via a referendum in 1924 and the second hellenic republic was declared . premier georgios kondylis took power in 1935 and effectively abolished the republic by bringing back the monarchy via a referendum in 1935 . a coup d 'etat followed in 1936 and installed ioannis metaxas as the head of a dictatorial regime known as the 4th of august regime . although a dictatorship , greece remained on good terms with britain and was not allied with the axis .
mobbing can be an interspecies activity : it is common for birds to respond to mobbing calls of a different species . many birds will show up at the sight of mobbing and watch and call , but not participate . it should also be noted that some species can be on both ends of a mobbing attack . crows are frequently mobbed by smaller songbirds as they prey on eggs and young from these birds ' nests , but these same crows will cooperate with smaller birds to drive away hawks or larger mammalian predators . on occasion , birds will mob animals that pose no threat .
hegel certainly intends to preserve what he takes to be true of german idealism , in particular kant 's insistence that ethical reason can and does go beyond finite inclinations . for hegel there must be some identity of thought and being for the " subject " ( any human observer ) ) to be able to know any observed " object " ( any external entity , possibly even another human ) at all . under hegel 's concept of " subject-object identity , " subject and object both have spirit ( hegel 's ersatz , redefined , nonsupernatural " god " ) as their conceptual ( not metaphysical ) inner reality - and in that sense are identical . but until spirit 's " self-realization " occurs and spirit graduates from spirit to absolute spirit status , subject ( a human mind ) mistakenly thinks every " object " it observes is something " alien , " meaning something separate or apart from " subject . " in hegel 's words , " the object is revealed to it [ to " subject " ] by [ as ] something alien , and it does not recognize itself . " self-realization occurs when hegel ( part of spirit 's nonsupernatural mind , which is the collective mind of all humans ) arrives on the scene and realizes that every " object " is himself , because both subject and object are essentially spirit . when self-realization occurs and spirit becomes absolute spirit , the " finite " ( man , human ) becomes the " infinite " ( " god , " divine ) , replacing the imaginary or " picture-thinking " supernatural god of theism : man becomes god . tucker puts it this way : " hegelianism . . . is a religion of self-worship whose fundamental theme is given in hegel 's image of the man who aspires to be god himself , who demands ' something more , namely infinity . ' " the picture hegel presents is " a picture of a self-glorifying humanity striving compulsively , and at the end successfully , to rise to divinity . "
air quality in boston is generally very good : during the ten-year period 2004-2013 , there were only 4 days in which the air was unhealthy for the general public , according to the epa .
the university of kansas school of law was the top law school in the state of kansas , and 68th nationally , according to the 2014 u.s. news & world report " best graduate schools " edition . classes are held in green hall at w 15th st and burdick dr , which is named after former dean james green .
early human genetic cluster analysis studies were conducted with samples taken from ancestral population groups living at extreme geographic distances from each other . it was thought that such large geographic distances would maximize the genetic variation between the groups sampled in the analysis and thus maximize the probability of finding cluster patterns unique to each group . in light of the historically recent acceleration of human migration ( and correspondingly , human gene flow ) on a global scale , further studies were conducted to judge the degree to which genetic cluster analysis can pattern ancestrally identified groups as well as geographically separated groups . one such study looked at a large multiethnic population in the united states , and " detected only modest genetic differentiation between different current geographic locales within each race / ethnicity group . thus , ancient geographic ancestry , which is highly correlated with self-identified race / ethnicity - as opposed to current residence - is the major determinant of genetic structure in the u.s. population . " ( tang et al . ( 2005 ) )
the term " early modern " was introduced in the english language in the 1930s. to distinguish the time between what we call middle ages and time of the late enlightenment ( 1800 ) ( when the meaning of the term modern ages was developing its contemporary form ) . it is important to note that these terms stem from european history . in usage in other parts of the world , such as in asia , and in muslim countries , the terms are applied in a very different way , but often in the context with their contact with european culture in the age of discovery .
the beidou-2 system began offering services for the asia-pacific region in december 2012 . at this time , the system could provide positioning data between longitude 55 ° e to 180 ° e and from latitude 55 ° s to 55 ° n .
cyprus ( i / ˈsaɪprəs / ; greek : κυπρος ipa : [ ˈcipros ] ; turkish : kıbrıs ipa : [ ˈkɯbɾɯs ] ) , officially the republic of cyprus ( greek : κυπριακη δημοκρατια ; turkish : kıbrıs cumhuriyeti ) , is an island country in the eastern mediterranean sea , off the coasts of syria and turkey . [ e ] cyprus is the third largest and third most populous island in the mediterranean , and a member state of the european union . it is located south of turkey , west of syria and lebanon , northwest of israel and palestine , north of egypt and east of greece .
many of the city 's buildings are in the georgian style , although there are a number of examples of modern landmark structures , such as county hall tower , which was , at one time the tallest building in ireland until being superseded by another cork city building : the elysian . across the river from county hall is ireland 's longest building ; built in victorian times , our lady 's psychiatric hospital has now been renovated and converted into a residential housing complex called atkins hall , after its architect william atkins .
in september 1975 , gaddafi purged the army , arresting around 200 senior officers , and in october he founded the clandestine office for the security of the revolution . in 1976 , student demonstrations broke out in tripoli and benghazi , and were attacked by police and gaddafist students . the rcc responded with mass arrests , and introduced compulsory national service for young people . dissent also arose from conservative clerics and the muslim brotherhood , who were persecuted as anti-revolutionary . in january 1977 , two dissenting students and a number of army officers were publicly hanged ; amnesty international condemned it as the first time in gaddafist libya that dissenters had been executed for purely political crimes .
compass-m1 transmits in 3 bands : e2 , e5b , and e6 . in each frequency band two coherent sub-signals have been detected with a phase shift of 90 degrees ( in quadrature ) . these signal components are further referred to as " i " and " q. " the " i " components have shorter codes and are likely to be intended for the open service . the " q " components have much longer codes , are more interference resistive , and are probably intended for the restricted service . iq modulation has been the method in both wired and wireless digital modulation since morsetting carrier signal 100 years ago .
nonverbal communication describes the process of conveying meaning in the form of non-word messages . examples of nonverbal communication include haptic communication , chronemic communication , gestures , body language , facial expression , eye contact , and how one dresses . nonverbal communication also relates to intent of a message . examples of intent are voluntary , intentional movements like shaking a hand or winking , as well as involuntary , such as sweating . speech also contains nonverbal elements known as paralanguage , e.g. rhythm , intonation , tempo , and stress . there may even be a pheromone component . research has shown that up to 55 % of human communication may occur through non-verbal facial expressions , and a further 38 % through paralanguage . it affects communication most at the subconscious level and establishes trust . likewise , written texts include nonverbal elements such as handwriting style , spatial arrangement of words and the use of emoticons to convey emotion .
all military occupations were open to women in 1989 , with the exception of submarine service , which opened in 2000 . throughout the 1990s , the introduction of women into the combat arms increased the potential recruiting pool by about 100 percent . it also provided opportunities for all persons to serve their country to the best of their abilities . women were fully integrated in all occupations and roles by the government of jean chretien , and by 8 march 2000 , even allowed to serve on submarines .
the administration of lord north ( 1770-1782 ) tried to defeat the colonist rebellion by military force . british and american forces clashed in 1775 and , in 1776 , came the american declaration of independence . burke was appalled by celebrations in britain of the defeat of the americans at new york and pennsylvania . he claimed the english national character was being changed by this authoritarianism . burke wrote : " as to the good people of england , they seem to partake every day more and more of the character of that administration which they have been induced to tolerate . i am satisfied , that within a few years there has been a great change in the national character . we seem no longer that eager , inquisitive , jealous , fiery people , which we have been formerly . "
having small population size is a characteristic almost universally inherent to apex predators , humans and dogs by far the most blatant exceptions . low numbers wouldn 't be a problem for apex predators if there was an abundance of prey and no competition or niche overlap , a scenario that is rarely , if ever , encountered in the wild . the competitive exclusion principle states that if two species ' ecological niches overlap , there is a very high likelihood of competition as both species are in direct competition for the same resources . this factor alone could lead to the extirpation of one or both species , but is compounded by the added factor of prey abundance .
uses of a sequence of events include stories , historical events ( chronology ) , directions and steps in procedures , and timetables for scheduling activities . a sequence of events may also be used to help describe processes in science , technology , and medicine . a sequence of events may be focused on past events ( e.g. , stories , history , chronology ) , on future events that must be in a predetermined order ( e.g. , plans , schedules , procedures , timetables ) , or focused on the observation of past events with the expectation that the events will occur in the future ( e.g. , processes ) . the use of a sequence of events occurs in fields as diverse as machines ( cam timer ) , documentaries ( seconds from disaster ) , law ( choice of law ) , computer simulation ( discrete event simulation ) , and electric power transmission ( sequence of events recorder ) . a specific example of a sequence of events is the timeline of the fukushima daiichi nuclear disaster .
matter should not be confused with mass , as the two are not quite the same in modern physics . for example , mass is a conserved quantity , which means that its value is unchanging through time , within closed systems . however , matter is not conserved in such systems , although this is not obvious in ordinary conditions on earth , where matter is approximately conserved . still , special relativity shows that matter may disappear by conversion into energy , even inside closed systems , and it can also be created from energy , within such systems . however , because mass ( like energy ) can neither be created nor destroyed , the quantity of mass and the quantity of energy remain the same during a transformation of matter ( which represents a certain amount of energy ) into non-material ( i.e. , non-matter ) energy . this is also true in the reverse transformation of energy into matter .
the alps ( / ælps / ; italian : alpi [ ˈalpi ] ; french : alpes [ alp ] ; german : alpen [ ˈʔalpm  ] ; slovene : alpe [ ˈaːlpɛ ] ) are the highest and most extensive mountain range system that lies entirely in europe , stretching approximately 1,200 kilometres ( 750 mi ) across eight alpine countries : austria , france , germany , italy , liechtenstein , monaco , slovenia , and switzerland . the caucasus mountains are higher , and the urals longer , but both lie partly in asia . the mountains were formed over tens of millions of years as the african and eurasian tectonic plates collided . extreme shortening caused by the event resulted in marine sedimentary rocks rising by thrusting and folding into high mountain peaks such as mont blanc and the matterhorn . mont blanc spans the french-italian border , and at 4,810 m ( 15,781 ft ) is the highest mountain in the alps . the alpine region area contains about a hundred peaks higher than 4,000 m ( 13,123 ft ) , known as the " four-thousanders . "
polyols , compounds containing more than one alcohol functional group , generally interact with cupric salts . for example , copper salts are used to test for reducing sugars . specifically , using benedict 's reagent and fehling 's solution the presence of the sugar is signaled by a color change from blue cu ( ii ) to reddish copper ( i ) oxide . schweizer 's reagent and related complexes with ethylenediamine and other amines dissolve cellulose . amino acids form very stable chelate complexes with copper ( ii ) . many wet-chemical tests for copper ions exist , one involving potassium ferrocyanide , which gives a brown precipitate with copper ( ii ) salts .
to the east of the county are upland areas leading to the pennines . north of the ribble is beacon fell country park and the forest of bowland , another aonb . much of the lowland in this area is devoted to dairy farming and cheesemaking , whereas the higher ground is more suitable for sheep , and the highest ground is uncultivated moorland . the valleys of the river ribble and its tributary the calder form a large gap to the west of the pennines , overlooked by pendle hill . most of the larger lancashire towns are in these valleys south of the ribble are the west pennine moors and the forest of rossendale where former cotton mill towns are in deep valleys . the lancashire coalfield , largely in modern-day greater manchester , extended into merseyside and to ormskirk , chorley , burnley and colne in lancashire .
one hundred years after the fall of constantinople in 1453 , pierre belon described in his work observations in 1553 that pissasphalto , a mixture of pitch and bitumen , was used in dubrovnik for tarring of ships from where it was exported to a market place in venice where it could be bought by anyone . an 1838 edition of mechanics magazine cites an early use of asphalt in france . a pamphlet dated 1621 , by " a certain monsieur d 'eyrinys , states that he had discovered the existence ( of asphaltum ) in large quantities in the vicinity of neufchatel , " and that he proposed to use it in a variety of ways - " principally in the construction of air-proof granaries , and in protecting , by means of the arches , the water-courses in the city of paris from the intrusion of dirt and filth , " which at that time made the water unusable . " he expatiates also on the excellence of this material for forming level and durable terraces " in palaces , " the notion of forming such terraces in the streets not one likely to cross the brain of a parisian of that generation . " but it was generally neglected in france until the revolution of 1830 . then , in the 1830s , there was a surge of interest , and asphalt became widely used " for pavements , flat roofs , and the lining of cisterns , and in england , some use of it had been made of it for similar purposes . " its rise in europe was " a sudden phenomenon , " after natural deposits were found " in france at osbann ( basrhin ) , the parc ( l 'ain ) and the puy-de-la-poix ( puy-de-dome ) , " although it could also be made artificially . one of the earliest uses in france was the laying of about 24,000 square yards of seyssel asphalt at the place de la concorde in 1835 .
oral rehydration solution ( ors ) ( a slightly sweetened and salty water ) can be used to prevent dehydration . standard home solutions such as salted rice water , salted yogurt drinks , vegetable and chicken soups with salt can be given . home solutions such as water in which cereal has been cooked , unsalted soup , green coconut water , weak tea ( unsweetened ) , and unsweetened fresh fruit juices can have from half a teaspoon to full teaspoon of salt ( from one-and-a-half to three grams ) added per liter . clean plain water can also be one of several fluids given . there are commercial solutions such as pedialyte , and relief agencies such as unicef widely distribute packets of salts and sugar . a who publication for physicians recommends a homemade ors consisting of one liter water with one teaspoon salt ( 3 grams ) and two tablespoons sugar ( 18 grams ) added ( approximately the " taste of tears " ) . rehydration project recommends adding the same amount of sugar but only one-half a teaspoon of salt , stating that this more dilute approach is less risky with very little loss of effectiveness . both agree that drinks with too much sugar or salt can make dehydration worse .
the onset of the southwest monsoon is anticipated to reach punjab by may , but since the early 1970s the weather pattern has been irregular . the spring monsoon has either skipped over the area or has caused it to rain so hard that floods have resulted . june and july are oppressively hot . although official estimates rarely place the temperature above 46 ° c , newspaper sources claim that it reaches 51 ° c and regularly carry reports about people who have succumbed to the heat . heat records were broken in multan in june 1993 , when the mercury was reported to have risen to 54 ° c. in august the oppressive heat is punctuated by the rainy season , referred to as barsat , which brings relief in its wake . the hardest part of the summer is then over , but cooler weather does not come until late october .
the most extreme forms of cubism were not those practiced by picasso and braque , who resisted total abstraction . other cubists , by contrast , especially frantisek kupka , and those considered orphists by apollinaire ( delaunay , leger , picabia and duchamp ) , accepted abstraction by removing visible subject matter entirely . kupka 's two entries at the 1912 salon d 'automne , amorpha-fugue a deux couleurs and amorpha chromatique chaude , were highly abstract ( or nonrepresentational ) and metaphysical in orientation . both duchamp in 1912 and picabia from 1912 to 1914 developed an expressive and allusive abstraction dedicated to complex emotional and sexual themes . beginning in 1912 delaunay painted a series of paintings entitled simultaneous windows , followed by a series entitled formes circulaires , in which he combined planar structures with bright prismatic hues ; based on the optical characteristics of juxtaposed colors his departure from reality in the depiction of imagery was quasi-complete . in 1913-14 leger produced a series entitled contrasts of forms , giving a similar stress to color , line and form . his cubism , despite its abstract qualities , was associated with themes of mechanization and modern life . apollinaire supported these early developments of abstract cubism in les peintres cubistes ( 1913 ) , writing of a new " pure " painting in which the subject was vacated . but in spite of his use of the term orphism these works were so different that they defy attempts to place them in a single category .
philadelphia has more public art than any other american city . in 1872 , the association for public art ( formerly the fairmount park art association ) was created , the first private association in the united states dedicated to integrating public art and urban planning . in 1959 , lobbying by the artists equity association helped create the percent for art ordinance , the first for a u.s. city . the program , which has funded more than 200 pieces of public art , is administered by the philadelphia office of arts and culture , the city 's art agency .
all of the highways into wenchuan , and others throughout the province , were damaged , resulting in delayed arrival of the rescue troops . in beichuan county , 80 % of the buildings collapsed according to xinhua news . in the city of shifang , the collapse of two chemical plants led to leakage of some 80 tons of liquid ammonia , with hundreds of people reported buried . in the city of dujiangyan , south-east of the epicenter , a whole school collapsed with 900 students buried and fewer than 60 survived . the juyuan middle school , where many teenagers were buried , was excavated by civilians and cranes . dujiangyan is home of the dujiangyan irrigation system , an ancient water diversion project which is still in use and is a unesco world heritage site . the project 's famous fish mouth was cracked but not severely damaged otherwise .
evolutionary anthropology is the interdisciplinary study of the evolution of human physiology and human behaviour and the relation between hominins and non-hominin primates . evolutionary anthropology is based in natural science and social science , combining the human development with socioeconomic factors . evolutionary anthropology is concerned with both biological and cultural evolution of humans , past and present . it is based on a scientific approach , and brings together fields such as archaeology , behavioral ecology , psychology , primatology , and genetics . it is a dynamic and interdisciplinary field , drawing on many lines of evidence to understand the human experience , past and present .
regional social norms are generally antagonistic to hunting , while a few sects , such as the bishnoi , lay special emphasis on the conservation of particular species , such as the antelope . india 's wildlife protection act of 1972 bans the killing of all wild animals . however , the chief wildlife warden may , if satisfied that any wild animal from a specified list has become dangerous to human life , or is so disabled or diseased as to be beyond recovery , permit any person to hunt such an animal . in this case , the body of any wild animal killed or wounded becomes government property .
credentials are typically conferred at the undergraduate level , however university-affiliated schools like the ecole de technologie superieure and the ecole polytechnique de montreal ( both of which are located in quebec ) , also offer graduate and postgraduate programs , in accordance with provincial higher education guidelines . canadian higher education institutions , at all levels , undertake directed and applied research with financing allocated through public funding , private equity , or industry sources .
in the us air force , the distinction between bombers , fighters that are actually fighter-bombers , and attack aircraft has become blurred . many attack aircraft , even ones that look like fighters , are optimized to drop bombs , with very little ability to engage in aerial combat . many fighter aircraft , such as the f-16 , are often used as ' bomb trucks ' , despite being designed for aerial combat . perhaps the one meaningful distinction at present is the question of range : a bomber is generally a long-range aircraft capable of striking targets deep within enemy territory , whereas fighter bombers and attack aircraft are limited to ' theater ' missions in and around the immediate area of battlefield combat . even that distinction is muddied by the availability of aerial refueling , which greatly increases the potential radius of combat operations . the us , russia , and the people 's republic of china operate strategic bombers .
every year a " brotherhood and unity " relay race is organized in montenegro , macedonia and serbia which ends at the " house of flowers " in belgrade on may 25 - the final resting place of tito . at the same time , runners in slovenia , croatia and bosnia and herzegovina set off for kumrovec , tito 's birthplace in northern croatia . the relay is a left-over from yugoslav times , when young people made a similar yearly trek on foot through yugoslavia that ended in belgrade with a massive celebration .
the pro-decolonisation labour government , elected at the 1945 general election and led by clement attlee , moved quickly to tackle the most pressing issue facing the empire : that of indian independence . india 's two major political parties - the indian national congress and the muslim league - had been campaigning for independence for decades , but disagreed as to how it should be implemented . congress favoured a unified secular indian state , whereas the league , fearing domination by the hindu majority , desired a separate islamic state for muslim-majority regions . increasing civil unrest and the mutiny of the royal indian navy during 1946 led attlee to promise independence no later than 1948 . when the urgency of the situation and risk of civil war became apparent , the newly appointed ( and last ) viceroy , lord mountbatten , hastily brought forward the date to 15 august 1947 . the borders drawn by the british to broadly partition india into hindu and muslim areas left tens of millions as minorities in the newly independent states of india and pakistan . millions of muslims subsequently crossed from india to pakistan and hindus vice versa , and violence between the two communities cost hundreds of thousands of lives . burma , which had been administered as part of the british raj , and sri lanka gained their independence the following year in 1948 . india , pakistan and sri lanka became members of the commonwealth , while burma chose not to join .
species that have no long-distance migratory relatives , such as the waxwings bombycilla , are effectively moving in response to winter weather and the loss of their usual winter food , rather than enhanced breeding opportunities .
most mammals are viviparous , giving birth to live young . however , the five species of monotreme , the platypuses and the echidnas , lay eggs . the monotremes have a sex determination system different from that of most other mammals . in particular , the sex chromosomes of a platypus are more like those of a chicken than those of a therian mammal . like marsupials and most other mammals , monotreme young are larval and fetus-like , as the presence of epipubic bones prevents the expansion of the torso , forcing them to produce small young .
the impressive , costly , and centralised rites to the deities of the roman state were vastly outnumbered in everyday life by commonplace religious observances pertaining to an individual 's domestic and personal deities , the patron divinities of rome 's various neighborhoods and communities , and the often idiosyncratic blends of official , unofficial , local and personal cults that characterised lawful roman religion . in this spirit , a provincial roman citizen who made the long journey from bordeaux to italy to consult the sibyl at tibur did not neglect his devotion to his own goddess from home :
in the 1950s , lewis binford suggested that early humans were obtaining meat via scavenging , not hunting . early humans in the lower paleolithic lived in forests and woodlands , which allowed them to collect seafood , eggs , nuts , and fruits besides scavenging . rather than killing large animals for meat , according to this view , they used carcasses of such animals that had either been killed by predators or that had died of natural causes . archaeological and genetic data suggest that the source populations of paleolithic hunter-gatherers survived in sparsely wooded areas and dispersed through areas of high primary productivity while avoiding dense forest cover .
after some time ( typically 1-2 hours in humans , 4-6 hours in dogs , 3-4 hours in house cats ) , [ citation needed ] the resulting thick liquid is called chyme . when the pyloric sphincter valve opens , chyme enters the duodenum where it mixes with digestive enzymes from the pancreas and bile juice from the liver and then passes through the small intestine , in which digestion continues . when the chyme is fully digested , it is absorbed into the blood . 95 % of absorption of nutrients occurs in the small intestine . water and minerals are reabsorbed back into the blood in the colon ( large intestine ) where the ph is slightly acidic about 5.6 ~ 6.9 . some vitamins , such as biotin and vitamin k ( k2mk7 ) produced by bacteria in the colon are also absorbed into the blood in the colon . waste material is eliminated from the rectum during defecation .
many mechanical aids to calculation and measurement were constructed for astronomical and navigation use . the planisphere was a star chart invented by abu rayhan al-biruni in the early 11th century . the astrolabe was invented in the hellenistic world in either the 1st or 2nd centuries bc and is often attributed to hipparchus . a combination of the planisphere and dioptra , the astrolabe was effectively an analog computer capable of working out several different kinds of problems in spherical astronomy . an astrolabe incorporating a mechanical calendar computer and gear-wheels was invented by abi bakr of isfahan , persia in 1235 . abu rayhan al-biruni invented the first mechanical geared lunisolar calendar astrolabe , an early fixed-wired knowledge processing machine with a gear train and gear-wheels , circa 1000 ad .
two rounds of soviet purges directed by moscow ( 1927-1934 and 1937-1938 ) resulted in the expulsion of nearly 10,000 people , from all levels of the communist party of tajikistan . ethnic russians were sent in to replace those expelled and subsequently russians dominated party positions at all levels , including the top position of first secretary . between 1926 and 1959 the proportion of russians among tajikistan 's population grew from less than 1 % to 13 % . bobojon ghafurov , tajikistan 's first secretary of the communist party of tajikistan from 1946-1956 was the only tajikistani politician of significance outside of the country during the soviet era . he was followed in office by tursun uljabayev ( 1956-61 ) , jabbor rasulov ( 1961-1982 ) , and rahmon nabiyev ( 1982-1985 , 1991-1992 ) .
the montevideo cabildo was the seat of government during the colonial times of the viceroyalty of the rio de la plata . it is located in front of constitution square , in ciudad vieja . built between 1804 and 1869 in neoclassical style , with a series of doric and ionic columns , it became a national heritage site in 1975 . in 1958 , the municipal historic museum and archive was inaugurated here . it features three permanent city museum exhibitions , as well as temporary art exhibitions , cultural events , seminars , symposiums and forums .
the development of the appreciation medals was initiated by the white house and executed by the bureau of the mint through the u.s. mint in philadelphia . the medals were struck from september 1958 through october 1960 . a total of twenty designs are cataloged with a total mintage of 9,858 . each of the designs incorporates the text " with appreciation " or " with personal and official gratitude " accompanied with eisenhower 's initials " d.d.e. " or facsimile signature . the design also incorporates location , date , and / or significant event . prior to the end of his second term as president , 1,451 medals were turned-in to the bureau of the mint and destroyed . the eisenhower appreciation medals are part of the presidential medal of appreciation award medal series .
puberty occurs through a long process and begins with a surge in hormone production , which in turn causes a number of physical changes . it is the stage of life characterized by the appearance and development of secondary sex characteristics ( for example , a deeper voice and larger adam 's apple in boys , and development of breasts and more curved and prominent hips in girls ) and a strong shift in hormonal balance towards an adult state . this is triggered by the pituitary gland , which secretes a surge of hormonal agents into the blood stream , initiating a chain reaction to occur . the male and female gonads are subsequently activated , which puts them into a state of rapid growth and development ; the triggered gonads now commence the mass production of the necessary chemicals . the testes primarily release testosterone , and the ovaries predominantly dispense estrogen . the production of these hormones increases gradually until sexual maturation is met . some boys may develop gynecomastia due to an imbalance of sex hormones , tissue responsiveness or obesity .
the americo-liberian settlers did not identify with the indigenous peoples they encountered , especially those in communities of the more isolated " bush . " they knew nothing of their cultures , languages or animist religion . encounters with tribal africans in the bush often developed as violent confrontations . the colonial settlements were raided by the kru and grebo people from their inland chiefdoms . because of feeling set apart and superior by their culture and education to the indigenous peoples , the americo-liberians developed as a small elite that held on to political power . it excluded the indigenous tribesmen from birthright citizenship in their own lands until 1904 , in a repetition of the united states ' treatment of native americans . because of the cultural gap between the groups and assumption of superiority of western culture , the americo-liberians envisioned creating a western-style state to which the tribesmen should assimilate . they encouraged religious organizations to set up missions and schools to educate the indigenous peoples .
copper , silver and gold are in group 11 of the periodic table , and they share certain attributes : they have one s-orbital electron on top of a filled d-electron shell and are characterized by high ductility and electrical conductivity . the filled d-shells in these elements do not contribute much to the interatomic interactions , which are dominated by the s-electrons through metallic bonds . unlike metals with incomplete d-shells , metallic bonds in copper are lacking a covalent character and are relatively weak . this explains the low hardness and high ductility of single crystals of copper . at the macroscopic scale , introduction of extended defects to the crystal lattice , such as grain boundaries , hinders flow of the material under applied stress , thereby increasing its hardness . for this reason , copper is usually supplied in a fine-grained polycrystalline form , which has greater strength than monocrystalline forms .
the first hdtv transmissions in europe , albeit not direct-to-home , began in 1990 , when the italian broadcaster rai used the hd-mac and muse hdtv technologies to broadcast the 1990 fifa world cup . the matches were shown in 8 cinemas in italy and 2 in spain . the connection with spain was made via the olympus satellite link from rome to barcelona and then with a fiber optic connection from barcelona to madrid . after some hdtv transmissions in europe the standard was abandoned in the mid-1990s .
many older buildings in certain areas of boston are supported by wooden piles driven into the area 's fill ; these piles remain sound if submerged in water , but are subject to dry rot if exposed to air for long periods . groundwater levels have been dropping , to varying degrees , in many areas of the city , due in part to an increase in the amount of rainwater discharged directly into sewers rather than absorbed by the ground . a city agency , the boston groundwater trust , coordinates monitoring of groundwater levels throughout the city via a network of public and private monitoring wells . however , boston 's drinking water supply , from the quabbin and wachusett reservoirs to the west , is one of the very few in the country so pure as to satisfy federal water quality standards without filtration .
in april , during the revolution of 1848 in paris , he left for london , where he performed at several concerts and at numerous receptions in great houses . this tour was suggested to him by his scottish pupil jane stirling and her elder sister . stirling also made all the logistical arrangements and provided much of the necessary funding .
research institutes linked to the third level colleges in the city support the research and innovation capacity of the city and region . examples include the tyndall national institute ( ict hardware research ) , imerc ( marine energy ) , environmental research institute , nimbus ( network embedded systems ) ; and create ( advanced therapeutic engineering ) . ucc and cit also have start-up company incubation centres . in ucc , the ignite graduate business innovation centre aims to foster and support entrepreneurship . in cit , the rubicon centre is a business innovation hub that is home to 57 knowledge based start-up companies .
as of the census of 2000 , there were 197,790 people , 84,549 households , and 43,627 families residing in the city . the population density was 3,292.6 people per square mile ( 1,271.3 / km ² ) . there were 92,282 housing units at an average density of 1,536.2 per square mile ( 593.1 / km ² ) . the racial makeup of the city was 38.3 % white , 57.2 % african american , 0.2 % native american , 1.3 % asian , 0.1 % pacific islander , 1.5 % from other races , and 1.5 % from two or more races . hispanic or latino of any race were 2.6 % of the population .
on 10 may 1963 , john xxiii received the balzan prize in private at the vatican but deflected achievements of himself to the five popes of his lifetime , pope leo xiii to pius xii . on 11 may , the italian president antonio segni officially awarded pope john xxiii with the balzan prize for his engagement for peace . while in the car en route to the official ceremony , he suffered great stomach pains but insisted on meeting with segni to receive the award in the quirinal palace , refusing to do so within the vatican . he stated that it would have been an insult to honour a pontiff on the remains of the crucified saint peter . it was the pope 's last public appearance .
in the parliament of the united kingdom , plymouth is represented by the three constituencies of plymouth moor view , plymouth sutton and devonport and south west devon and within the european parliament as south west england . in the 2015 general election all three constituencies returned conservative mps , who were oliver colvile ( for devon south west ) , gary streeter ( for sutton and devonport ) and johnny mercer for moor view .
similarly , forensic anthropologists draw on highly heritable morphological features of human remains ( e.g. cranial measurements ) to aid in the identification of the body , including in terms of race . in a 1992 article , anthropologist norman sauer noted that anthropologists had generally abandoned the concept of race as a valid representation of human biological diversity , except for forensic anthropologists . he asked , " if races don 't exist , why are forensic anthropologists so good at identifying them ? " he concluded :
before the latter half of the 18th century , grain , timber and then coal were plymouth 's main imports . during this time the real source of wealth was from the neighbouring town of plymouth dock ( renamed in 1824 to devonport ) and the major employer in the entire region was the dockyard . the three towns conurbation of plymouth , stonehouse and devonport enjoyed some prosperity during the late 18th and early 19th century and were enriched by a series of neo-classical urban developments designed by london architect john foulston . foulston was important for both devonport and plymouth and was responsible for several grand public buildings , many now destroyed , including the athenaeum , the theatre royal and royal hotel , and much of union street .
the monument in the city of london provides views of the surrounding area while commemorating the great fire of london , which originated nearby . marble arch and wellington arch , at the north and south ends of park lane respectively , have royal connections , as do the albert memorial and royal albert hall in kensington . nelson 's column is a nationally recognised monument in trafalgar square , one of the focal points of central london . older buildings are mainly brick built , most commonly the yellow london stock brick or a warm orange-red variety , often decorated with carvings and white plaster mouldings .
in the later 1890s and into first decade of the 20th century , structural changes occurred in the operation of the pacific trading companies ; they moved from a practice of having traders resident on each island to instead becoming a business operation where the supercargo ( the cargo manager of a trading ship ) would deal directly with the islanders when a ship visited an island . from 1900 the numbers of palagi traders in tuvalu declined and the last of the palagi traders were fred whibley on niutao , alfred restieaux on nukufetau , and martin kleis on nui . by 1909 there were no more resident palagi traders representing the trading companies , although both whibley and restieaux remained in the islands until their deaths .
during the baroque era , keyboard music played on the harpsichord and pipe organ became increasingly popular , and the violin family of stringed instruments took the form generally seen today . opera as a staged musical drama began to differentiate itself from earlier musical and dramatic forms , and vocal forms like the cantata and oratorio became more common . vocalists began adding embellishments to melodies . instrumental ensembles began to distinguish and standardize by size , giving rise to the early orchestra for larger ensembles , with chamber music being written for smaller groups of instruments where parts are played by individual ( instead of massed ) instruments . the concerto as a vehicle for solo performance accompanied by an orchestra became widespread , although the relationship between soloist and orchestra was relatively simple .
new haven ( local / nuː ˈheɪvən / , noo-hay-vən ) , in the u.s. state of connecticut , is the principal municipality in greater new haven , which had a total population of 862,477 in 2010 . it is located on new haven harbor on the northern shore of the long island sound in new haven county , connecticut , which in turn comprises the outer limits of the new york metropolitan area . it is the second-largest city in connecticut ( after bridgeport ) , with a population of 129,779 people as of the 2010 united states census . according to a census of 1 july 2012 , by the census bureau , the city had a population of 130,741 .
during the summers at nohant , particularly in the years 1839-43 , chopin found quiet , productive days during which he composed many works , including his polonaise in a-flat major , op. 53 . among the visitors to nohant were delacroix and the mezzo-soprano pauline viardot , whom chopin had advised on piano technique and composition . delacroix gives an account of staying at nohant in a letter of 7 june 1842 :
however , since the end of the cold war , as the north atlantic treaty organization ( nato ) has moved much of its defence focus " out of area , " the canadian military has also become more deeply engaged in international security operations in various other parts of the world - most notably in afghanistan since 2002 .
the royal collection , which includes thousands of historic works of art and the crown jewels , is not owned by the queen personally but is held in trust , as are her official residences , such as buckingham palace and windsor castle , and the duchy of lancaster , a property portfolio valued in 2014 at £ 442 million . sandringham house and balmoral castle are privately owned by the queen . the british crown estate - with holdings of £ 9.4 billion in 2014 - is held in trust by the sovereign and cannot be sold or owned by elizabeth in a private capacity .
in this respect , the counterpart of ashkenazi is sephardic , since most non-ashkenazi orthodox jews follow sephardic rabbinical authorities , whether or not they are ethnically sephardic . by tradition , a sephardic or mizrahi woman who marries into an orthodox or haredi ashkenazi jewish family raises her children to be ashkenazi jews ; conversely an ashkenazi woman who marries a sephardi or mizrahi man is expected to take on sephardic practice and the children inherit a sephardic identity , though in practice many families compromise . a convert generally follows the practice of the beth din that converted him or her . with the integration of jews from around the world in israel , north america , and other places , the religious definition of an ashkenazi jew is blurring , especially outside orthodox judaism .
on september 6 , 2006 , sony announced that pal region playstation 3 launch would be delayed until march 2007 , because of a shortage of materials used in the blu-ray drive . at the tokyo game show on september 22 , 2006 , sony announced that it would include an hdmi port on the 20 gb system , but a chrome trim , flash card readers , silver logo and wi-fi would not be included . also , the launch price of the japanese 20 gb model was reduced by over 20 % , and the 60 gb model was announced for an open pricing scheme in japan . during the event , sony showed 27 playable ps3 games running on final hardware .
however , by the turn of the 1990s the downward trend was starting to reverse ; england had been successful in the 1990 fifa world cup , reaching the semi-finals . uefa , european football 's governing body , lifted the five-year ban on english clubs playing in european competitions in 1990 ( resulting in manchester united lifting the uefa cup winners ' cup in 1991 ) and the taylor report on stadium safety standards , which proposed expensive upgrades to create all-seater stadiums in the aftermath of the hillsborough disaster , was published in january of that year .
media outlets began reporting in late september 2009 that comcast was in talks to buy nbcuniversal . comcast denied the rumors at first , while nbc would not comment on them . however , cnbc itself reported on october 1 that general electric was considering spinning nbcuniversal off into a separate company that would merge the nbc television network and its cable properties such as usa network , syfy and msnbc with comcast 's content assets . ge would maintain 49 % control of the new company , while comcast owned 51 % . vivendi , which owns 20 % , would have to sell its stake to ge . it was reported that under the current deal with ge that it would happen in november or december . it was also reported that time warner would be interested in placing a bid , until ceo jeffrey l. bewkes directly denied interest , leaving comcast the sole bidder . on november 1 , 2009 , the new york times reported comcast had moved closer to a deal to purchase nbcuniversal and that a formal announcement could be made sometime the following week .
other armenian diasporans that rose to fame in classical or international music circles are world-renowned french-armenian singer and composer charles aznavour , pianist sahan arzruni , prominent opera sopranos such as hasmik papian and more recently isabel bayrakdarian and anna kasyan . certain armenians settled to sing non-armenian tunes such as the heavy metal band system of a down ( which nonetheless often incorporates traditional armenian instrumentals and styling into their songs ) or pop star cher . in the armenian diaspora , armenian revolutionary songs are popular with the youth . these songs encourage armenian patriotism and are generally about armenian history and national heroes .
within a species not all populations may be migratory ; this is known as " partial migration . " partial migration is very common in the southern continents ; in australia , 44 % of non-passerine birds and 32 % of passerine species are partially migratory . in some species , the population at higher latitudes tends to be migratory and will often winter at lower latitude . the migrating birds bypass the latitudes where other populations may be sedentary , where suitable wintering habitats may already be occupied . this is an example of leap-frog migration . many fully migratory species show leap-frog migration ( birds that nest at higher latitudes spend the winter at lower latitudes ) , and many show the alternative , chain migration , where populations ' slide ' more evenly north and south without reversing order .
two inland ports on rivers serve oklahoma : the port of muskogee and the tulsa port of catoosa . the only port handling international cargo in the state , the tulsa port of catoosa is the most inland ocean-going port in the nation and ships over two million tons of cargo each year . both ports are located on the mcclellan-kerr arkansas river navigation system , which connects barge traffic from tulsa and muskogee to the mississippi river via the verdigris and arkansas rivers , contributing to one of the busiest waterways in the world .
the " rheinische " carnival is held in the west of germany , mainly in the states of north rhine-westphalia or nordrhein-westfalen , rhineland palatinate or rheinland-pfalz , but also in hessen [ including oberhessen ] , bavaria and other states . some cities are more famous for celebrations such as parades and costume balls . koln or cologne carnival , as well as mainz and dusseldorf are the largest and most famous . other cities have their own , often less well-known celebrations , parades and parties such as worms am rhein , speyer , kaiserslautern , frankfurt , darmstadt , mannheim , ludwigshafen , stuttgart , augsburg and munchen [ munich ] nurnberg . on carnival thursday ( called " old women day " or " the women 's day " ) in commemoration of an 1824 revolt by washer-women , women storm city halls , cut men 's ties , and are allowed to kiss any passing man .
with the rapid growth of industrial workers in the auto factories , labor unions such as the american federation of labor and the united auto workers fought to organize workers to gain them better working conditions and wages . they initiated strikes and other tactics in support of improvements such as the 8-hour day / 40-hour work week , increased wages , greater benefits and improved working conditions . the labor activism during those years increased influence of union leaders in the city such as jimmy hoffa of the teamsters and walter reuther of the autoworkers .
since the system 's launch , production costs have been reduced significantly as a result of phasing out the emotion engine chip and falling hardware costs . the cost of manufacturing cell microprocessors has fallen dramatically as a result of moving to the 65 nm production process , and blu-ray disc diodes have become cheaper to manufacture . as of january 2008 , each unit cost around $ 400 to manufacture ; by august 2009 , sony had reduced costs by a total of 70 % , meaning it only costs sony around $ 240 per unit .
in june 1854 , the allied expeditionary force landed at varna , a city on the black sea 's western coast ( now in bulgaria ) . they made little advance from their base there . : 175-176 in july 1854 , the turks under omar pasha crossed the danube into wallachia and on 7 july 1854 , engaged the russians in the city of giurgiu and conquered it . the capture of giurgiu by the turks immediately threatened bucharest in wallachia with capture by the same turk army . on 26 july 1854 , tsar nicholas i ordered the withdrawal of russian troops from the principalities . also , in late july 1854 , following up on the russian retreat , the french staged an expedition against the russian forces still in dobruja , but this was a failure . : 188-190
in the 1990s , marked by the liberalization of language development and mother tongue movement in taiwan , taiwanese hokkien had undergone a fast pace in its development . in 1993 , taiwan became the first region in the world to implement the teaching of taiwanese hokkien in taiwanese schools . in 2001 , the local taiwanese language program was further extended to all schools in taiwan , and taiwanese hokkien became one of the compulsory local taiwanese languages to be learned in schools . the mother tongue movement in taiwan even influenced xiamen ( amoy ) to the point that in 2010 , xiamen also began to implement the teaching of hokkien dialect in its schools . in 2007 , the ministry of education in taiwan also completed the standardization of chinese characters used for writing hokkien and developed tai-lo as the standard hokkien pronunciation and romanization guide . a number of universities in taiwan also offer hokkien degree courses for training hokkien-fluent talents to work for the hokkien media industry and education . taiwan also has its own hokkien literary and cultural circles whereby hokkien poets and writers compose poetry or literature in hokkien on a regular basis .
capitalisation in english , in terms of the general orthographic rules independent of context ( e.g. title vs. heading vs. text ) , is universally standardized for formal writing . ( informal communication , such as texting , instant messaging or a handwritten sticky note , may not bother , but that is because its users usually do not expect it to be formal . ) in english , capital letters are used as the first letter of a sentence , a proper noun , or a proper adjective . there are a few pairs of words of different meanings whose only difference is capitalisation of the first letter . the names of the days of the week and the names of the months are also capitalised , as are the first-person pronoun " i " and the interjection " o " ( although the latter is uncommon in modern usage , with " oh " being preferred ) . other words normally start with a lower-case letter . there are , however , situations where further capitalisation may be used to give added emphasis , for example in headings and titles ( see below ) . in some traditional forms of poetry , capitalisation has conventionally been used as a marker to indicate the beginning of a line of verse independent of any grammatical feature .
the formation of the party was formally announced at sydney town hall on 31 august 1945 . it took the name " liberal " in honour of the old commonwealth liberal party . the new party was dominated by the remains of the old uap ; with few exceptions , the uap party room became the liberal party room . the australian women 's national league , a powerful conservative women 's organisation , also merged with the new party . a conservative youth group menzies had set up , the young nationalists , was also merged into the new party . it became the nucleus of the liberal party 's youth division , the young liberals . by september 1945 there were more than 90,000 members , many of whom had not previously been members of any political party .
in the united states , heating , ventilation and air conditioning ( hvac ) systems account for 30 % ( 4.65 ej / yr ) of the energy used in commercial buildings and nearly 50 % ( 10.1 ej / yr ) of the energy used in residential buildings . solar heating , cooling and ventilation technologies can be used to offset a portion of this energy .
agriculture is dominated by the cultivation and sale of food crops such as cassava , peanuts , maize , sorghum , millet , sesame , and plantain . the annual real gdp growth rate is just above 3 % . the importance of food crops over exported cash crops is indicated by the fact that the total production of cassava , the staple food of most central africans , ranges between 200,000 and 300,000 tonnes a year , while the production of cotton , the principal exported cash crop , ranges from 25,000 to 45,000 tonnes a year . food crops are not exported in large quantities , but still constitute the principal cash crops of the country , because central africans derive far more income from the periodic sale of surplus food crops than from exported cash crops such as cotton or coffee . [ citation needed ] much of the country is self-sufficient in food crops ; however , livestock development is hindered by the presence of the tsetse fly . [ citation needed ]
southeast tucson continues to experience rapid residential development . the area includes davis-monthan air force base . the area is considered to be south of golf links road . it is the home of santa rita high school , chuck ford park ( lakeside park ) , lakeside lake , lincoln park ( upper and lower ) , the lakecrest neighborhoods , and pima community college east campus . the atterbury wash with its access to excellent bird watching is also located in the southeast tucson area . the suburban community of rita ranch houses many of the military families from davis-monthan , and is near the southeastern-most expansion of the current city limits . close by rita ranch and also within the city limits lies civano , a planned development meant to showcase ecologically sound building practices and lifestyles .
the majority of the citizens of the marshall islands are of marshallese descent , though there are small numbers of immigrants from the united states , china , philippines and other pacific islands . the two official languages are marshallese , which is a member of the malayo-polynesian languages , and english . almost the entire population of the islands practises some religion , with three-quarters of the country either following the united church of christ - congregational in the marshall islands ( ucccmi ) or the assemblies of god .
lossless audio compression produces a representation of digital data that decompress to an exact digital duplicate of the original audio stream , unlike playback from lossy compression techniques such as vorbis and mp3 . compression ratios are around 50-60 % of original size , which is similar to those for generic lossless data compression . lossless compression is unable to attain high compression ratios due to the complexity of waveforms and the rapid changes in sound forms . codecs like flac , shorten and tta use linear prediction to estimate the spectrum of the signal . many of these algorithms use convolution with the filter [ -1 1 ] to slightly whiten or flatten the spectrum , thereby allowing traditional lossless compression to work more efficiently . the process is reversed upon decompression .
the soviets also helped germany to avoid british naval blockades by providing a submarine base , basis nord , in the northern soviet union near murmansk . this also provided a refueling and maintenance location , and a takeoff point for raids and attacks on shipping . in addition , the soviets provided germany with access to the northern sea route for both cargo ships and raiders ( though only the commerce raider komet used the route before the german invasion ) , which forced britain to protect sea lanes in both the atlantic and the pacific .
the humoral ( antibody ) response is defined as the interaction between antibodies and antigens . antibodies are specific proteins released from a certain class of immune cells known as b lymphocytes , while antigens are defined as anything that elicits the generation of antibodies ( " anti " body " gen " erators ) . immunology rests on an understanding of the properties of these two biological entities and the cellular response to both .
